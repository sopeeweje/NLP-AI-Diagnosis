"Disparities in prostate cancer decision-making and QOL    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Among men, prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor and the second most common cause of cancer death. Compared with whites, blacks not only have higher incidence and mortality rates but, in adjusted analyses, undergo less prostatectomy and tend to have lower post-treatment HRQOL. It is possible that these treatment and QOL disparities emerge, in part, from differences in how black and white men make decisions about treatment, with blacks less likely to receive forms of treatment that would be congruent with their preferences. This exploratory study among black and white men who have been treated for localized prostate cancer will utilize individual interviews in order to characterize several potential influences on the treatment decision-making process. A goal is to describe how men recall the decision-making period following the diagnosis of cancer and how they interpret the quality of their lives and the treatment decisions they made. A second objective is to identify racial differences in factors that influence decision-making and QOL. This information will be used to inform the design of a follow-up, prospective research protocol to assess the relationship between specific aspects of decision-making and longer-term, post-treatment HRQOL outcomes. Knowledge gained will also lead to interventions for patients and clinicians to improve the decision-making process.

"Determinants of Disparity in Prostate Cancer Outcomes    This Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) is being proposed to address significant gaps in our knowledge about factors that predict prostate cancer outcomes, and in particular the causes of disparity in prostate cancer outcomes between men of African and Caucasian descent. The mission of the proposed center is to 1) study the complex interaction of biological, clinical, behavioral, and environmental factors predictive of outcomes following a prostate cancer diagnosis, 2) evaluate how these factors explain disparities in prostate cancer outcomes by etnicity, and 3) disseminate this information to at-risk populations and the public health community. The CPHHD builds on our existing multidisciplinary research resources that include studies of the genetics, quality of life, patterns of care, physical environment, and social environment after the diagnosis of prostate cancer. This research requires transdisciplinary collaboration across molecular biology, genetic epidemiology, sociology, the behavioral sciences, and health policy. The proposed research has implications for clinical and public health practice, with potential to catalyze critical improvements in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. The CPHHD will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To undertake four highly interrelated research projects aimed at identifying factors that influence prostate cancer outcomes. These projects will evaluate the role of behavioral and environmental factors associated with physician and patient screening practices, screening behavior and genotypes on prostate cancer clinical outcomes, social and environmental factors on quality of life, and discrimination on treatment and medical outcomes after prostate cancer diagnoses. Specific Aim 2: To create three specialized cores to serve the needs of the CPHHD. These include: (1) an Administration Core to oversee and evaluate the CPHHD; (2) a Community Education and Dissemination Core to facilitate ongoing interactions with our community partners, and and to translate the information gained from this research to the public health community and general population; and (3) a Biomedical Informatics Core to provide integrated data management and to construct a comprehensive model of the multivariate biological, behavioral, social, and  environmental factors on prostate cancer outcomes. Specific Aim 3: To solicit and support a series of focused high priority developmental (pilot) research projects. These projects will be chosen to extend the primary research projects to additional studies of cancer screening, biological interactions, statistical model building for the integration of complex data from various disciplines.

"Informed Decision Making Regarding PSA Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is intense disagreement in the medical community regarding the value of population based PSA screening for asymptomatic men, and the efficacy of aggressive treatment of screen-detected disease. In the midst of this controversy, professional groups are increasingly advocating fully informing men of the pros and cons of screening and allowing them to make a personal decision regarding whether to obtain screening. Although informed decision-making is rapidly becoming the ""standard of care"" in this area, there is a paucity of information regarding how screening decisions are made in real world settings, and the best ways to promote an informed decision. This information gap is especially acute for ethnic minority men, who have not been systematically studied with respect to prostate cancer screening. Therefore, we propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of an intervention designed to increase informed decision-making regarding prostate cancer screening in a community sample of Hispanic men. Hispanics constitute very large proportions of the Los Angeles and California populations, and prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in this group.   We will recruit 900 Hispanic men from multiple community-based organizations in the Los Angeles area, and administer an in-person baseline interview. Following this, subjects will be randomized to the two study arms. The Intervention Group (N=450) will be invited to attend a small group discussion session aimed at informing men about the nature of prostate cancer, pros and cons of screening, the controversy surrounding treatment of early stage disease, and the importance of making an active and informed decision regarding obtaining a PSA [prostate-specific antigen] test. They will also receive culturally tailored print materials summarizing the information presented in the intervention session. The Control Group (N=450) will be given a pre-existing, publicly available pamphlet, that mentions the availability of screening tests for prostate cancer but does not include details regarding the pros and cons of screening, or other elements of the intervention. Subjects in both groups will be re-contacted 12-months post baseline and administered a telephone interview to assess the impact of our intervention. The two main outcomes will include a composite measure of informed decision making (multidimensional construct including knowledge of prostate cancer and the pros and cons of screening, communication with physician or others regarding screening, and active participation in the screening decision) and receipt of PSA in the past 12 months.

"Modeling US Prostate Cancer Trends: PSA, Treatment & Ra*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This study aims to determine the population impact of changing strategies for prostate cancer control, by linking trends in disease incidence and mortality with trends in screening and treatment.      The advent of PSA screening has transformed the way in which prostate cancer is detected and managed in the US.  Today, the majority of prostate cancers in this country are screen-detected and localized. Increasing numbers of newly-diagnosed cases are being treated with hormone suppression therapy (HT), which has traditionally been reserved for advanced tumors. Cause-specific survival among prostate cancer cases has increased dramatically, but the real increase in life expectancy during the PSA era remains unclear.      How have advances in screening and treatment contributed to prostate cancer death rates that have fallen by almost 30 percent since the early 1990s? And can racial disparities in patterns of care explain why mortality declines among African Americans are, only two-thirds of those among whites? We will use surveillance modeling to address these questions, building on our previous CISNET work, which modeled PSA screening. Our methods will combine simulation models and maximum likelihood analysis to address the following Specific Aims:   (1) Estimate the real improvement in life expectancy among prostate cancer cases during the PSA era;   (2) Quantify the contributions to mortality declines of PSA screening and HT, and evaluate whether the benefit of screening given growing use of HT exceeds the benefit that would be expected under standard therapies;   (3) Determine whether racial differences in PSA screening and HT can account for the different mortality declines experienced by whites and African Americans; and   (4) Address whether disease natural history differs according to race, by estimating lead times associated with PSA screening that are consistent with incidence trends in whites and African Americans.      Our models will require reliable estimates of trends in screening and treatment, which we will obtain using SEER-Medicare data, as well as patient claims data from a large HMO based in Northern California.      Through this work, our study promises to shed light on two of the most active controversies in prostate cancer research: the value of PSA screening versus advances in prostate cancer treatment, and the link between disparities in care and racial differences in prostate cancer outcomes.         ","Modeling US Prostate Cancer Trends: PSA, Treatment & Ra*",6960796,U01CA088160,[''],NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,U01,2005,338092,0.3780711093835506
"A Black Man Can ...Fight Prostate Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal is for the development, implementation, and evaluation of a series of regional conferences under the collaboration of the National Black Leadership Initiative on Cancer III Community Networks Program: (NBLIC III), and the Second Opinion Society (SOS).  The black men and prostate cancer series entitled, ""A Black Man Can... Fight Prostate Cancer,"" is designed to increase the lay public's knowledge and awareness of the disproportionate burden of prostate cancer in black males in the United States (U.S.).  Black males in the U.S. include African Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, and native Africans living in the U.S.  We believe that a series of regional scientific conferences is an effective strategy that can be used to inform black men who are at-risk for, or affected by, prostate cancer about risk factors, prevention, early detection, treatment and social support resources.  To achieve the conference aims, we have developed a conference agenda that provides conference attendees with information and strategies aimed at addressing prostate cancer disparities in black males.  The conference will:  [1] expose attendees to the latest information related to prostate cancer risk and outcomes and its relationship to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, as well as cancer-related technologies, cancer research findings relevant to black males, social support resources, and available treatment options; [2] discuss barriers to recruiting black males into prostate cancer prevention and intervention clinical trials; [3] present effective lifestyle behaviors that may be used to decrease prostate cancer risk, and [4] discuss strategies to engage the black community in building a cadre of persons who can provide cancer information and social support to prostate cancer survivors.

"Breast and Prostate Cancer Data Quality and Patterns of Care Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This study aims to reduce the burden of cancer by influencing adherence to standards of cancer care for female breast cancer and by better understanding patterns of care for prostate cancer. Disparities in cancer treatment that are identified in the Minnesota component of this study will inform interventions undertaken by the Minnesota Cancer Alliance, the public-private collaboration implementing the state's comprehensive cancer control plan. Cancer Plan Minnesota has identified reducing disparities in cancer treatment as a top priority. This study addresses the goals of CDC-supported research by improving cancer control and enhancing the health of persons diagnosed with two common cancers. The specific objectives of this study are to develop and implement a standardized protocol which will 1) evaluate the quality of data on stage at diagnosis and first course of treatment on a representative sample of eligible invasive female breast and prostate cancers reported to each of the selected registries, 2) collect additional information from the medical records of reabstracted cases which may not be routinely abstracted but which has been shown to influence treatment received (e.g., comorbid illnesses, type of insurance, method of detection, diagnostic workup, and family history of cancer), 3) analyze the enhanced data to determine the proportion of persons diagnosed with these cancers who received the recommended standard of therapy, or, for prostate cancer, different treatment modalities, and assess the determinants of receiving quality care (e.g., race/ethnicity, urban/rural residence, insurance status, and publicly available information on hospital and provider characteristics) in each of the selected registries, and 4) combine data from all selected registries to assess data quality and cancer treatment for these two common cancer sites in the selected registries. This application proposes to reabstract clinical information on 2,500 Minnesota women diagnosed with Stage I, II, or III breast cancer and 2,500 men diagnosed with prostate cancer during 2004 (non-Hispanic white) or 2003-2005 (not non-Hispanic white). Results of consolidated reabstracted data on stage at diagnosis and treatment received will be compared to originally abstracted data to determine data quality. Simple descriptive statistics will be used to describe treatment received. Logistic regression will be used to evaluate determinants of treatment received and identify disparities.

"Improving Patient Outcomes Through System Navigation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this application is to address a national priority in cancer control research by developing and conducting a highly innovative patient navigation program from the point of abnormal screening test to treatment for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. The major venue for this program of research will be the Denver Health Medical Center (DH), which is the single largest ""safety net"" health care system linked to a major metropolitan area in the Rocky Mountain Region. DH serves a large number of minority (75%) and underserved patients (almost half without insurance). Unique features of this research are: (1) testing for efficacy and cost-effectiveness a comprehensive patient navigator program that will extend an existing and exemplary community lay health worker demonstration project at DH (Community Voices); (2) combining this resource with a well-established telephone counseling service to specifically address patient-centered psychosocial barriers; and (3) integrating these components into a comprehensive patient navigator program within the context of the healthcare provider institution.   The following specific aims will guide the evaluation of this program: (1) to reduce the time between an abnormal screening test for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers to a positive or negative pathologic diagnosis; (2) to reduce the time from a positive pathologic diagnosis of breast, colorectal or prostate cancers to the start of therapy; (3) to increase the proportion of these patients adhering to recommendations for care, including completion of additional diagnostic tests, consultation appointments, and completion of treatment; (4) to improve patient reported outcomes of medical self-efficacy, satisfaction with care and distress related to cancer diagnosis in a sample of individuals with a negative pathologic diagnosis and among all individuals with a positive pathologic diagnosis; and (5) to examine the cost-effectiveness and return on investment of patient navigation.

The mission of the proposed center is to 1) study the complex interaction of biological, clinical, behavioral, and environmental factors predictive of outcomes following a prostate cancer diagnosis, 2) evaluate how these factors explain disparities in prostate cancer outcomes by etnicity, and 3) disseminate this information to at-risk populations and the public health community. The CPHHD builds on our existing multidisciplinary research resources that include studies of the genetics, quality of life, patterns of care, physical environment, and social environment after the diagnosis of prostate cancer. This research requires transdisciplinary collaboration across molecular biology, genetic epidemiology, sociology, the behavioral sciences, and health policy. The proposed research has implications for clinical and public health practice, with potential to catalyze critical improvements in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. The CPHHD will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To undertake four highly interrelated research projects aimed at identifying factors that influence prostate cancer outcomes. These projects will evaluate the role of behavioral and environmental factors associated with physician and patient screening practices, screening behavior and genotypes on prostate cancer clinical outcomes, social and environmental factors on quality of life, and discrimination on treatment and medical outcomes after prostate cancer diagnoses. Specific Aim 2: To create three specialized cores to serve the needs of the CPHHD. These include: (1) an Administration Core to oversee and evaluate the CPHHD; (2) a Community Education and Dissemination Core to facilitate ongoing interactions with our community partners, and and to translate the information gained from this research to the public health community and general population; and (3) a Biomedical Informatics Core to provide integrated data management and to construct a comprehensive model of the multivariate biological, behavioral, social, and  environmental factors on prostate cancer outcomes. Specific Aim 3: To solicit and support a series of focused high priority developmental (pilot) research projects. These projects will be chosen to extend the primary research projects to additional studies of cancer screening, biological interactions, statistical model building for the integration of complex data from various disciplines. The goal of these developmental projects is to expand the scope of the research proposed in the four Projects described here and to enhance the multidisciplinary research team with members representing additional disciplines and expertise.

"Prostate cancer in Blacks: Role of poverty and diet DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in cancer prevention and control, with a focus on studying racial and ethnic disparities in cancer morbidity and mortality.  Minority populations bear an unequal cancer burden, and the Candidate proposes to develop unique and innovative methodologies to help understand these disparities.  The K07 will provide for the development of new and enhanced knowledge and skills in two areas essential to the Candidate's future research efforts aimed at helping to reduce cancer health disparities: 1) spatial epidemiology, including use of geographic information systems; and, 2) cancer prevention and control, including health behavior (especially regarding diet and physical activity).   The proposed training plan includes 1) course work; 2) regular mentoring from Sponsors and Collaborators; 3) participation in seminars and national conferences; 4) tutorials by experts; and, 5) mentored research.  K07 didactic experiences will be applied in a mentored research project.   Specific Aims of Project: 1) develop a geographic information system that maps prostate cancer incidence in the southeastern United States; 2) develop spatial regression models aimed at explaining the possible association of poverty, income, urban/rural residence, and race to the geographic patterning of prostate cancer incidence; 3) conduct a telephone survey of dietary fat intake among African Americans and whites in selected rural and urban sites in Virginia; and 4) investigate whether any correlation exists between dietary fat intake in these areas and the incidence of prostate cancer.  K07 project findings will be used to help develop culturally appropriate interventions in African-American communities to decrease dietary fat intake and increase physical activity.

"Informed Decision Making Regarding PSA Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is intense disagreement in the medical community regarding the value of population based PSA screening for asymptomatic men, and the efficacy of aggressive treatment of screen-detected disease. In the midst of this controversy, professional groups are increasingly advocating fully informing men of the pros and cons of screening and allowing them to make a personal decision regarding whether to obtain screening. Although informed decision-making is rapidly becoming the ""standard of care"" in this area, there is a paucity of information regarding how screening decisions are made in real world settings, and the best ways to promote an informed decision. This information gap is especially acute for ethnic minority men, who have not been systematically studied with respect to prostate cancer screening. Therefore, we propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of an intervention designed to increase informed decision-making regarding prostate cancer screening in a community sample of Hispanic men. Hispanics constitute very large proportions of the Los Angeles and California populations, and prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in this group.   We will recruit 900 Hispanic men from multiple community-based organizations in the Los Angeles area, and administer an in-person baseline interview. Following this, subjects will be randomized to the two study arms. The Intervention Group (N=450) will be invited to attend a small group discussion session aimed at informing men about the nature of prostate cancer, pros and cons of screening, the controversy surrounding treatment of early stage disease, and the importance of making an active and informed decision regarding obtaining a PSA [prostate-specific antigen] test. They will also receive culturally tailored print materials summarizing the information presented in the intervention session. The Control Group (N=450) will be given a pre-existing, publicly available pamphlet, that mentions the availability of screening tests for prostate cancer but does not include details regarding the pros and cons of screening, or other elements of the intervention. Subjects in both groups will be re-contacted 12-months post baseline and administered a telephone interview to assess the impact of our intervention. The two main outcomes will include a composite measure of informed decision making (multidimensional construct including knowledge of prostate cancer and the pros and cons of screening, communication with physician or others regarding screening, and active participation in the screening decision) and receipt of PSA in the past 12 months.

"Understanding racial differences in the natural history of prostate cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is characterized by large racial differences in both incidence and post-diagnosis survival. Known disparities in health care access and utilization complicate uncovering underlying differences in the natural history of the disease. Such differences can be caused by racial variations in risk factors such as diet or genetic predisposition. Understanding and quantifying them is important for the development of health policies. We propose to use modeling techniques to estimate the manner and extent of racial differences in the natural history of prostate cancer. Our model uses the dynamics of prostate cancer incidence after the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening to obtain information about the preclinical stage of the disease. We will rely on the SEER-Medicare database for detailed estimates of prostate cancer incidence and screening behavior. Our specific aims are to estimate age- and race-specific rates of transurethral resection of the prostate and PSA tests in the SEER 9 registries; to develop a model for screening behavior variability; to develop a model for prostate cancer incidence; and, finally, to use the models and the screening dissemination data to assess similarities and differences in the natural history of prostate cancer between blacks and whites.         ",Understanding racial differences in the natural history of prostate cancer,7031300,R21CA114361,"['aging ', ' model ', ' prostate neoplasm ', ' behavior ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2006,113620,0.3414636410421533
"Variations of care in older men with prostate cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will use prostate cancer as a model to analyze variations in health resource utilization, cost of care, and factors associated with the process of chronic illness as antecedents and responses to health problems. Objective: to analyze the complex interplay of prostate cancer treatment, comorbidities, socioeconomic, hospital and physician factors and their relationships with treatment modalities, health resource utilization and direct medical care cost. Specific Aims (1): To analyze the variation in short and long term health resource utilization and direct cost of care across African American and Caucasian elderly prostate cancer patients, controlling for stage at diagnosis, physician and hospital characteristics and comorbidity. (2): To determine if differential rates of surgery (or radiation therapy) contribute to survival disparity between African American and Caucasian elderly prostate cancer patients. (3): To determine if differences in physician characteristics contribute to survival disparity between African American and Caucasian elderly prostate cancer patients. (4): To determine if differences in hospital characteristics contribute to survival disparity between African American and Caucasian elderly prostate cancer patients. Methods: We propose a cohort control design using SEER-Medicare databases. Prostate cancer patients diagnosed in 1995 or 1996 will be identified and followed retrospectively one-year pre and five years post diagnosis. Health resource utilization, treatment modalities and cost of care will be analyzed across ethnicity. Analyses will adjust for comorbidity, socioeconomic status and stage. To compute incremental cost attributable to prostate cancer, a control group of patients without cancer will be selected (matched by age, ethnicity and zip-code) from the Medicare database. Cumulative cost per patient per year will be computed and adjusted to 2005 dollars. For the prostate cancer group, total cost of care will be differentiated, as cost attributable to prostate cancer vs other diagnoses. Multivariate log linear regression models will be used to identify factors associated with direct medical cost across ethnicity. Cox proportional hazard models will be used to study the association between type of treatment and survival across ethnicity. We will use Instrumental variable approach to address the issues related to the selection bias.The outcome of this study will generate preliminary results and a working model leading to a RO1.         ",Variations of care in older men with prostate cancer,7047346,R03CA121338,"['health ', ' hospital ', ' prostate neoplasm ', ' surgery ', ' diagnosis ', ' comorbidity ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2006,78500,0.3409179654259306
"Word on the Street - Creating Multigenerational Prostate Cancer Dialogue    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer statistics reveal the most glaring example of racial/ethnically-based cancer health disparities among American males. African American men have the highest reported rate of prostate cancer in the world, with an incidence rate that is 1.4 times higher than that of whites, and a mortality rate that is 2.3 times greater. Given the range of possible treatments, their uncertain efficacies, their possible negative effects on quality-of-life, and the lack of clear-cut medical guidelines, decisions surrounding a prostate cancer diagnosis can be particularly confusing and anxiety-producing. The goal of this pilot project is to understand current knowledge, beliefs, and practices that either facilitate or inhibit pathways to receiving work-up and treatment for prostate cancer in the African American community. Results from this project will provide the basis for development of a decision aid to promote active participation of African American men and their families in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment decisions while planning for overcoming barriers that may hinder these decisions. The many medical, social, and economic obstacles that families face in the decision maze will be explored. To accomplish these objectives, researchers will work in partnership with community partners, healthcare providers and government to build a community network to aid individuals in this decision process. Community partners have a long and successful collaboration through the Witness Project of LI, a faith based breast cancer outreach effort began in Arkansas. The impetus for this proposal stems from community requests to expand efforts to prostate cancer. Key informant interviews, focus groups and town meetings will be used to collect and synthesize information about what our community is ""saying, doing and thinking"" about an elevated Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), work-up and treatment for prostate cancer. The specific aims of this pilot project are to: 1-determines patient-, community-, and system-level variables that facilitate or obstruct pathways to work-up and treatment for prostate cancer among African Americans; 2- collaborate with community partners to develop a prostate cancer treatment decision-aid based on interviews, focus groups, and town meetings. This project has the potential to foster community dialogue and create a decision aid for a disease that has tremendous medical, social and societal impact for African Americans. Greater patient involvement in decision making is also believed to improve health care quality.           ",Word on the Street - Creating Multigenerational Prostate Cancer Dialogue,7068885,R21CA119976,"['family ', ' prostate neoplasm ', ' decision making ', ' community ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NCI,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2006,176273,0.3726219809715247
"Modeling US Prostate Cancer Trends: PSA, Treatment & Ra*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This study aims to determine the population impact of changing strategies for prostate cancer control, by linking trends in disease incidence and mortality with trends in screening and treatment.      The advent of PSA screening has transformed the way in which prostate cancer is detected and managed in the US.  Today, the majority of prostate cancers in this country are screen-detected and localized. Increasing numbers of newly-diagnosed cases are being treated with hormone suppression therapy (HT), which has traditionally been reserved for advanced tumors. Cause-specific survival among prostate cancer cases has increased dramatically, but the real increase in life expectancy during the PSA era remains unclear.      How have advances in screening and treatment contributed to prostate cancer death rates that have fallen by almost 30 percent since the early 1990s? And can racial disparities in patterns of care explain why mortality declines among African Americans are, only two-thirds of those among whites? We will use surveillance modeling to address these questions, building on our previous CISNET work, which modeled PSA screening. Our methods will combine simulation models and maximum likelihood analysis to address the following Specific Aims:   (1) Estimate the real improvement in life expectancy among prostate cancer cases during the PSA era;   (2) Quantify the contributions to mortality declines of PSA screening and HT, and evaluate whether the benefit of screening given growing use of HT exceeds the benefit that would be expected under standard therapies;   (3) Determine whether racial differences in PSA screening and HT can account for the different mortality declines experienced by whites and African Americans; and   (4) Address whether disease natural history differs according to race, by estimating lead times associated with PSA screening that are consistent with incidence trends in whites and African Americans.      Our models will require reliable estimates of trends in screening and treatment, which we will obtain using SEER-Medicare data, as well as patient claims data from a large HMO based in Northern California.      Through this work, our study promises to shed light on two of the most active controversies in prostate cancer research: the value of PSA screening versus advances in prostate cancer treatment, and the link between disparities in care and racial differences in prostate cancer outcomes.         ","Modeling US Prostate Cancer Trends: PSA, Treatment & Ra*",7122087,U01CA088160,"['computer simulation ', ' cooperative study ', ' mass screening ', ' United States ', ' model design /development ', ' health care model ', ' mathematical model ', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' prostate neoplasm ', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology ', ' male ', ' human data ', ' prostate specific antigen ', ' clinical research ', ' meta analysis ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,U01,2006,350494,0.3780711093835506
"EphB2 as a Prostate Cancer tumor Suppressor and Risk Factor in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in African American men. Incidence and mortality rates are disproportionately higher among African American men when compared to Caucasian men in the US. The specific factors influencing this disparity remain poorly understood. Although dietary and environmental exposures are among the culprits, evidence exist, which support a role for genetic factors. Candidate gene studies have implicated several genes as being associated with increased prostate cancer risk among African American men. One interesting candidate gene encodes the EphB2 tyrosine kinase gene. The PI and colleagues were the first to report somatic mutations and loss of function of EphB2 in sporadic prostate cancer. Furthermore, we have recently published an association between EphB2 and prostate cancer risk in African Americans. Specifically, we have demonstrated that a common germline nonsense variant in EphB2 confers a three-fold increase in risk in African American men with a positive family history of prostate cancer. Furthermore, this nonsense variant is in admixture disequilibrium in African Americans. Taken together, these and existing data implicating EphB2 in prostate cancer warrant continued investigation. Our central hypothesis is that EphB2 is a genetic risk factor and tumor suppressor gene associated with prostate cancer in African American men. Specifically, we hypothesize that common variants in EphB2 are associated with prostate cancer risk in AA men and that this locus is associated with genomic loss in tumors from AA prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, we hypothesize that a common nonsense variant associated with risk (K1019X) confers a negative functional consequence on the EphB2 protein. To test our hypothesis we are proposing the following specific aims: 1. To test the association between PC risk and germline variants in the EphB2 gene in unselected AA PC cases and controls. 2. To evaluate loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the EphB2 locus in PC tumors from familial and sporadic AA cases. 3. To perform in vitro functional analysis of the K1019X mutation by introducing a mutated EphB2 construct into EphB2 null DU145 PC cells.              ",EphB2 as a Prostate Cancer tumor Suppressor and Risk Factor in African Americans,7128877,R01CA122009,"['genetics ', ' gene ', ' gene mutation ', ' neoplasm /cancer ', ' prostate neoplasm ', ' role ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NCI,TRANSLATIONAL GENOMICS RESEARCH INST,R01,2006,350101,0.33859150481805184

Among men with clinically localized disease, studies have documented racial and socioeconomic disparities in mortality and morbidity outcomes. We address the question of whether variation in the quality of radiotherapy may explain a portion of the observed disparities. The data source for this research will be the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize variation in the quality of radiotherapy and its relation to patient demographic and clinical characteristics and access to care. In Specific Aim 2, we will examine the relation between radiotherapy quality and event-free survival and post-therapy morbidity. We hypothesize that variation exists in adherence to radiotherapy quality measures and that patient factors like non-Hispanic white race and higher socioeconomic status may predict for receipt of higher quality radiotherapy. Furthermore, we hypothesize that higher radiotherapy quality performance is associated with longer event-free survival and lower morbidity.           ",Radiotherapy Quality and Outcomes in Prostate Cancer,7155946,F32CA123964,"['prostate neoplasm ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,F32,2006,60928,0.15565152993853285
"CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer deaths for that of Metropolitan Detroit have consistently exceeded that of the State of Michigan and the most of the United States. Black men are twice as likely to die from prostate cancer as are White men. Thus, it has been suggested that Detroit's racial makeup, with 80% of the males being Black, is the reason why the Detroit Metropolitan Area has one of the highest prostate cancer mortality rates in the country. Prior research has shown that, nationally, the racial/ethnic disparity in prostate cancer mortality is greatly affected by racial disparities in the use of definitive therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer. Within Metropolitan Detroit the impact of the racial disparity in prostate cancer treatment on the reported racial prostate cancer disparity in mortality is unknown. We will conduct a cross sectional study utilizing Metropolitan Detroit Surveillance Epidemiology End Result (SEER) tumor registry-Medicare Database to determine if racial/ethnic differences exist in the use of definitive treatment (radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy) for localized prostate cancer. If such differences are found, we will attempt to identify their causes. We hypothesize that within Metropolitan Detroit there is significant racial/ethnic disparity in the use of definitive therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer. Furthermore, this racial/ethnic disparity in the use of definitive therapy is tumor grade dependent resulting in a wider treatment disparity among men with higher-grade tumors. We will use the Surveillance Epidemiology End Result (SEER) Tumor Registry- Medicare Database to address the following specific aims: I) Determine the racial patterns in the use of definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy) among men in metropolitan Detroit who where 65 years of age and older diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer between 1992 thru 2002. II) Determine the influence of patient's comorbid disease status, socioeconomic status and cancer severity measures on the reported racial/ethnic disparity in use of definitive therapy in men in metropolitan Detroit who where 65 years of age and older diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer between 1992 thru 2002.           ",CNP for Older Underserved African American Adults,7227300,U01CA114583,[''],NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2006,75248,0.3962315348008589
"Prostate Cancer Survivor Outreach and Education Message Testing Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men, has a 60% greater incidence in African Americans than Whites, and mortality is more than double. Despite a steady decline in mortality since the early 1990s, the disparity in mortality persists, heightening the urgency of efforts to address the issue. The literature and past research by the study team inform the current proposal. Notably, community organizations are actively engaged in promoting prostate cancer prevention and have a great deal of potential to change knowledge, beliefs, intentions and behaviors, yet shortfalls exist in promoting informed decision-making. Screening rates for prostate cancer are also high, greater than 50% nationally. In light of the controversy regarding prostate cancer screening, these data point to the pressing need for research about effective approaches to enhance the likelihood that men who are screened do so in an informed manner. The present study aims to develop and assess an educational outreach strategy promoting increased knowledge about prostate cancer and informed decision-making about screening. The strategy will be designed for use by organizations working in community settings. Educational content will draw on interviews with clinicians, health educators and survivors with experience in community outreach. The strategy will include an informed decision-making process as well as survivor testimonies. A multi-method assessment of program effects on knowledge, beliefs, decision satisfaction and screening intentions will combine qualitative pre-testing and a quantitative quasi-experiment in community settings. The study seeks to assess the potential to promote informed prostate cancer decision-making in community-based outreach programs, as well as the unique contributions of survivor educators to program effects. The study builds upon past community-based participatory research on the topic by the Principal Investigator. It will be designed and implemented as an initiative of the Prostate Cancer Community Partnership, a consortium of community, academic, and clinical organizations working under the auspices of the Program to Eliminate Cancer Disparities at the Siteman Cancer Center. The educational strategy proposed in this application is intended to be a model for use by community organizations. This exploratory research aims to lead to further grant applications for funding by the NCI to conduct a larger quasi- experiment, followed by a field trial of the educational strategy within the context of a survivor-led prostate cancer outreach module.

"CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY SERVIC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) was established in 1999 at Clark Atlanta University to carry-out basic research in cancer biology and drug discovery. In 2004, the CCRTD decided to concentrate in the area of prostate cancer due to disproportionately higher incidence and mortality rate of this disease in African-American men. The current proposal requests support to establish a Center of Excellence in prostate cancer research, education and community education. The main objectives of this center will be 1) To carry out high quality basic research in cell and molecular biology of prostate cancer and to identify underlying biological reasons for racial disparities, 2) To establish a research training program for undergraduate and graduate students to provide research training in the area of prostate cancer and hence increase the number of minority (primarily African-American) scientists in this area of research, 3) To establish a community-based educational program for raising awareness on prevention, screening, early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. This goal will be achieved in collaboration with Clark Atlanta University Whitney M. Young, Jr. School of Social Work, Division of Communication Arts and Midtown Urology Educational Foundation. In the Research Core, we propose three research projects and 6 pilot projects focusing on prostate cancer cell and molecular biology and racial disparities. In the Training Core, we are requesting support for training of three graduate and 5 undergraduate students in the area of cancer biology and community service. In the Community Outreach/Education Core, we are requesting support to establish community events for free health screening for African-American men, for holding ""Town Hall"" educational meetings to be broadcast by the CAU-TV and radio stations, to develop public service announcements, and for hosting community events in conjunction with our annual national symposium on prostate cancer. The overall activities of the center will be monitored by the Administrative Core. The activities of the Administrative Core will be overseen by the Institutional (IAC), External (EAC) and Local External (LEAC) Advisory Committees. The long term goals of the center will be to understand the biology of prostate cancer, to increase the number of African-American scientists in cancer research, and to educate the African-American community in the areas of prostate cancer prevention, early detection and treatment.              ","CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY SERVIC",7304184,P20MD002285,[''],NIMHD,CLARK ATLANTA UNIVERSITY,P20,2007,1294436,0.3356848690564944

However, partners and the relationship are also affected when survivors experience distressing sexual, urinary, and bowel symptoms. Among African American men and their partners, the burden of symptom distress may be even greater. African American men have a 60 percent higher incidence rate of prostate cancer, more advanced disease at diagnosis, and mortality rates twice as high as those seen in Caucasian men. Research also indicates that African American men recover more slowly after treatment for prostate cancer. The proposed study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of a new, telephone-based coping skills training protocol tailored for African American prostate cancer survivors and their intimate partners. One hundred and eighty nine early stage African American prostate cancer survivors (stage T1-T3) and their intimate partners will be randomized to 1 of 3 conditions: 1) a 6-session partner-assisted Coping Skills Training (CST) intervention; 2) a Cancer Education intervention of equal duration, or 3) a wait-list control condition. Survivors will complete measures of symptom-related quality of life, depression, self-efficacy, and relationship quality at 3 time-points: pre- treatment, post-treatment, and 3-months follow-up. Partners will complete measures of caregiver strain, depression, self efficacy and relationship quality at the same 3 time points. If we find that partner-assisted CST is effective in African American prostate cancer survivors who have undergone prostatectomy surgery, future studies could evaluate partner-assisted CST in African American prostate cancer survivors who have undergone radiation therapies (for example, brachytherapy). Future studies could also evaluate partner-assisted CST in other populations of African American cancer survivors where large ethnic disparities in incidence and mortality rates exist, such as lung cancer, and colon cancer. Ultimately, by rigorously evaluating an intervention to enhance coping in African American prostate cancer survivors at increased risk for being underserved, this study may enlarge our repertoire of methods for reducing symptom distress and increasing quality of life for cancer survivors who are most in need.           ",Prostate Cancer Recovery Enhancement (PROCARE) for African American Men,7263292,R01CA122704,"['Couples ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Prostate Cancer Progress Review Group ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' urinary ', ' symptom management ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Incidence ', ' Intestines ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Distress ', ' Recovery ', ' Literature ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Funding ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Patients ', ' Staging ', ' Disruption ', ' Prostatectomy ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' survivorship ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Caucasians ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Brachytherapy ', ' Radioisotope Brachytherapy ', ' Radiation Brachytherapy ', ' Curietherapy ', ' intimate behavior ', ' intimacy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,414230,0.24655902895384058
"Oxidative Stress, Antioxidants and Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This career development award will provide crucial training and experience in population genetics, bioinformatics, haplotyping, and tag SNP identification for Cathryn Bock, Ph.D. She is an Assistant Professor at Karmanos Cancer Institute and Wayne State University, proposing formal training and research under the mentorship of Ann Schwartz, Ph.D. and Rick Kittles, Ph.D., who have considerable expertise in these areas. In addition to attending relevant classes, seminars, and meetings, she will examine genes in the oxidative stress pathway, antioxidant intake and their potential interaction effects on racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence and progression in a sample of African American (AA) and European American men from metropolitan Detroit. Despite the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with prostate cancer, neither the etiology of the disease is not well characterized, nor are the large racial disparities. Oxidative stress has been proposed as one mechanism of prostate cancer initiation and progression, and early evidence supports this hypothesis. However, the specific role of genes in the oxidative stress pathway and their interactions with dietary and supplemental antioxidants are not yet well understood. Furthermore, it is possible that some of the racial differences in prostate cancer risk and progression may be explained by differences in genes involved in the oxidative stress pathway and their interaction with antioxidant intake. Therefore, this study will first estimate ancestry of the AA subjects using ancestry-informative markers from a previous study. Tag SNPs in three genes in the oxidative stress pathway, SOD2, OGG1, and GPX1 will then be identified. We will next assess whether variation in these genes modifies prostate cancer risk associated with intake of the antioxidants vitamin E, selenium and lycopene. Furthermore, each of these potential interactions will be examined by race and by prostate cancer aggressiveness to see if these oxidative stress pathway measures explain racial differences or disease progression. All analyses within the AA men will control for ancestry. DMA for analysis, interview, questionnaire, and medical record data will come from participants in an existing case-control study of prostate cancer in which enrollment recently was completed (PI: Benjamin A. Rybicki, Ph.D.). There are 275 AA men and 362 EA men with prostate cancer and 99 AA and 125 EA age- and race-matched men without prostate cancer enrolled in the case-control study with available data and blood samples and eligible for inclusion. This training is essential for Dr. Bock's transition to being an independent researcher in the genetic epidemiology of cancer. The identification of genetic markers for prostate cancer risk and progression, and of racial differences in the interaction of these markers with intake of antioxidants will improve screening techniques and prevention targeting efforts.          ","Oxidative Stress, Antioxidants and Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer",7321269,K07CA119109,"['men ', "" men's "", ' Mentorship ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Superoxide Dismutase ', ' cytocuprein ', ' Hemocuprein ', ' Erythrocuprein ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Techniques ', ' Class ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' professor ', ' metropolitan ', ' lycopene ', ' psi,psi-carotene ', ' Lyc-O-Mato ', ' Participant ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' Selenium/vitamin E ', ' Population ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' OGG1 gene ', ' OGH1 Gene ', ' OGG1 ', ' N-Glycosylase/DNA Lyase Gene ', ' MUTM Gene ', ' MMH Gene ', ' SOD2 gene ', ' SOD2 ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Intake ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Gene-Modified ', ' Oxidative Stress Pathway ', ' Oxidative Stress Induced Gene Expression Via Nrf2 ', ' 8-oxoguanine ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Age ', ' glutathione peroxidase ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Medical Records ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,K07,2007,134731,0.3131696686278995
"Breast and Prostate Cancer Data Quality and Patterns of Care Study This study aims to reduce the burden of cancer by influencing adherence to standards of cancer care for female breast cancer and by better understanding patterns of care for prostate cancer. Disparities in cancer treatment that are identified in the Minnesota component of this study will inform interventions undertaken by the Minnesota Cancer Alliance, the public-private collaboration implementing the state's comprehensive cancer control plan. Cancer Plan Minnesota has identified reducing disparities in cancer treatment as a top priority. This study addresses the goals of CDC-supported research by improving cancer control and enhancing the health of persons diagnosed with two common cancers. The specific objectives of this study are to develop and implement a standardized protocol which will 1) evaluate the quality of data on stage at diagnosis and first course of treatment on a representative sample of eligible invasive female breast and prostate cancers reported to each of the selected registries, 2) collect additional information from the medical records of reabstracted cases which may not be routinely abstracted but which has been shown to influence treatment received (e.g., comorbid illnesses, type of insurance, method of detection, diagnostic workup, and family history of cancer), 3) analyze the enhanced data to determine the proportion of persons diagnosed with these cancers who received the recommended standard of therapy, or, for prostate cancer, different treatment modalities, and assess the determinants of receiving quality care (e.g., race/ethnicity, urban/rural residence, insurance status, and publicly available information on hospital and provider characteristics) in each of the selected registries, and 4) combine data from all selected registries to assess data quality and cancer treatment for these two common cancer sites in the selected registries. This application proposesto reabstract clinical information on 2,500 Minnesota women diagnosed with Stage I, II, or III breast cancer and 2,500 men diagnosed with prostate cancer during 2004 (non-Hispanic white) or 2003-2005 (not non-Hispanic white). Results of consolidated reabstracteddata on stage at diagnosis and treatment received will be compared to originally abstracted data to determine data quality. Simple descriptive statistics will be used to describe treatment received. Logistic regression will be used to evaluate determinants of treatment received and identify disparities. Findings will be disseminated through presentations and papers.

"Word on the Street - Creating Multigenerational Prostate Cancer Dialogue    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer statistics reveal the most glaring example of racial/ethnically-based cancer health disparities among American males. African American men have the highest reported rate of prostate cancer in the world, with an incidence rate that is 1.4 times higher than that of whites, and a mortality rate that is 2.3 times greater. Given the range of possible treatments, their uncertain efficacies, their possible negative effects on quality-of-life, and the lack of clear-cut medical guidelines, decisions surrounding a prostate cancer diagnosis can be particularly confusing and anxiety-producing. The goal of this pilot project is to understand current knowledge, beliefs, and practices that either facilitate or inhibit pathways to receiving work-up and treatment for prostate cancer in the African American community. Results from this project will provide the basis for development of a decision aid to promote active participation of African American men and their families in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment decisions while planning for overcoming barriers that may hinder these decisions. The many medical, social, and economic obstacles that families face in the decision maze will be explored. To accomplish these objectives, researchers will work in partnership with community partners, healthcare providers and government to build a community network to aid individuals in this decision process. Community partners have a long and successful collaboration through the Witness Project of LI, a faith based breast cancer outreach effort began in Arkansas. The impetus for this proposal stems from community requests to expand efforts to prostate cancer. Key informant interviews, focus groups and town meetings will be used to collect and synthesize information about what our community is ""saying, doing and thinking"" about an elevated Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), work-up and treatment for prostate cancer. The specific aims of this pilot project are to: 1-determines patient-, community-, and system-level variables that facilitate or obstruct pathways to work-up and treatment for prostate cancer among African Americans; 2- collaborate with community partners to develop a prostate cancer treatment decision-aid based on interviews, focus groups, and town meetings. This project has the potential to foster community dialogue and create a decision aid for a disease that has tremendous medical, social and societal impact for African Americans. Greater patient involvement in decision making is also believed to improve health care quality.           ",Word on the Street - Creating Multigenerational Prostate Cancer Dialogue,7230052,R21CA119976,"['Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Economics ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Cancer Information Service ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Guidelines ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' improved ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Glare ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Anxiety ', ' Recommendation ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Arkansas ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Belief ', ' interest ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Services ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' County Government ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Emotional ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' health literacy ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer statistics ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' stem ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' ']",NCI,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2007,142980,0.3726219809715247
"Understanding racial differences in the natural history of prostate cancer Prostate cancer is characterized by large racial differences in both incidence and post-diagnosis survival. Known disparities in health care access and utilization complicate uncovering underlying differences in the natural history of the disease. Such differences can be caused by racial variations in risk factors such as diet or genetic predisposition. Understanding and quantifying them is important for the development of health policies. We propose to use modeling techniques to estimate the manner and extent of racial differences in the natural history of prostate cancer. Our model uses the dynamics of prostate cancer incidence after the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening to obtain information about the preclinical stage of the disease. We will rely on the SEER-Medicare database for detailed estimates of prostate cancer incidence and screening behavior. Our specific aims are to estimate age- and race-specific rates of transurethral resection of the prostate and PSA tests in the SEER 9 registries; to develop a model for screening behavior variability; to develop a model for prostate cancer incidence; and, finally, to use the models and the screening dissemination data to assess similarities and differences in the natural history of prostate cancer between blacks and whites.

"EphB2 as a Prostate Cancer tumor Suppressor and Risk Factor in African Americans Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in African American men. Incidence and mortality rates are disproportionately higher among African American men when compared to Caucasian men in the US. The specific factors influencing this disparity remain poorly understood. Although dietary and environmental exposures are among the culprits, evidence exist, which support a role for genetic factors. Candidate gene studies have implicated several genes as being associated with increased prostate cancer risk among African American men. One interesting candidate gene encodes the EphB2 tyrosine kinase gene. The PI and colleagues were the first to report somatic mutations and loss of function of EphB2 in sporadic prostate cancer. Furthermore, we have recently published an association between EphB2 and prostate cancer risk in African Americans. Specifically, we have demonstrated that a common germline nonsense variant in EphB2 confers a three-fold increase in risk in African American men with a positive family history of prostate cancer. Furthermore, this nonsense variant is in admixture disequilibrium in African Americans. Taken together, these and existing data implicating EphB2 in prostate cancer warrant continued investigation. Our central hypothesis is that EphB2 is a genetic risk factor and tumor suppressor gene associated with prostate cancer in African American men. Specifically, we hypothesize that common variants in EphB2 are associated with prostate cancer risk in AA men and that this locus is associated with genomic loss in tumors from AA prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, we hypothesize that a common nonsense variant associated with risk (K1019X) confers a negative functional consequence on the EphB2 protein. To test our hypothesis we are proposing the following specific aims: 1. To test the association between PC risk and germline variants in the EphB2 gene in unselected AA PC cases and controls. 2. To evaluate loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the EphB2 locus in PC tumors from familial and sporadic AA cases. 3. To perform in vitro functional analysis of the K1019X mutation by introducing a mutated EphB2 construct into EphB2 null DU145 PC cells.

"A Black Man Can....Fight Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2005, there were an estimated 30,770 new cases of prostate cancer and more than 5,050 prostate cancer deaths in U.S. black men, thereby making prostate cancer their number one cause of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death.  Black men have more than twice the mortality rate as whites and three times the mortality as ethnic Hispanic/Latinos. This proposal is for the development, implementation, and evaluation of a series of regional conferences under the direction of the National Black Leadership Initiative on Cancer III Community Networks Program (NBLIC III).  The black men's prostate cancer conferences, titled ""A Black Man Can...Fight Prostate Cancer"", are designed to increase the lay public's knowledge and awareness of the disproportionate burden of prostate cancer in black males in the United States (U.S.).       To achieve the conference aims, we have developed a conference agenda that provides conference attendees with information and strategies aimed at addressing prostate cancer disparities in blacks. The conferences will:  [1] expose attendees to the latest information related to prostate cancer risk and outcomes and its relationship to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, as well as cancer-related technologies, cancer research findings relevant to black males, social support resources, and available treatment options; [2] discuss barriers to recruiting black males into prostate cancer prevention and intervention clinical trials; [3] describe effective lifestyle behaviors that may be used to decrease prostate cancer risk, and [4] present strategies to engage the black community in building a cadre of persons who can provide cancer information and social support to prostate cancer survivors.               ",A Black Man Can....Fight Prostate Cancer,7224784,R13CA126369,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Caribbean natives ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Affect ', ' Health ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Numbers ', ' African ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Community Networks ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' African Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' fighting ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' fight against ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' ']",NCI,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R13,2007,5000,0.3816838654235956
"Improving Patient Outcomes Through System Navigation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this application is to address a national priority in cancer control research by developing and conducting a highly innovative patient navigation program from the point of abnormal screening test to treatment for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. The major venue for this program of research will be the Denver Health Medical Center (DH), which is the single largest ""safety net"" health care system linked to a major metropolitan area in the Rocky Mountain Region. DH serves a large number of minority (75%) and underserved patients (almost half without insurance). Unique features of this research are: (1) testing for efficacy and cost-effectiveness a comprehensive patient navigator program that will extend an existing and exemplary community lay health worker demonstration project at DH (Community Voices); (2) combining this resource with a well-established telephone counseling service to specifically address patient-centered psychosocial barriers; and (3) integrating these components into a comprehensive patient navigator program within the context of the healthcare provider institution.   The following specific aims will guide the evaluation of this program: (1) to reduce the time between an abnormal screening test for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers to a positive or negative pathologic diagnosis; (2) to reduce the time from a positive pathologic diagnosis of breast, colorectal or prostate cancers to the start of therapy; (3) to increase the proportion of these patients adhering to recommendations for care, including completion of additional diagnostic tests, consultation appointments, and completion of treatment; (4) to improve patient reported outcomes of medical self-efficacy, satisfaction with care and distress related to cancer diagnosis in a sample of individuals with a negative pathologic diagnosis and among all individuals with a positive pathologic diagnosis; and (5) to examine the cost-effectiveness and return on investment of patient navigation. Ultimately we will demonstrate the efficacy and assess the financial impact associated with the implementation of a comprehensive navigation program designed to address disparities in cancer-related outcomes among the poor and underserved         ",Improving Patient Outcomes Through System Navigation,7278731,U01CA116903,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Range ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Pathologic ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Insurance ', ' Investments ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' satisfaction ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Appointment ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' programs ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Uninsured ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Navigation System ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' Consultations ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NCI,DENVER HEALTH AND HOSPITAL AUTHORITY,U01,2007,769238,0.13026754015250722
"Modeling US Prostate Cancer Trends: PSA, Treatment & Ra*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This study aims to determine the population impact of changing strategies for prostate cancer control, by linking trends in disease incidence and mortality with trends in screening and treatment.      The advent of PSA screening has transformed the way in which prostate cancer is detected and managed in the US.  Today, the majority of prostate cancers in this country are screen-detected and localized. Increasing numbers of newly-diagnosed cases are being treated with hormone suppression therapy (HT), which has traditionally been reserved for advanced tumors. Cause-specific survival among prostate cancer cases has increased dramatically, but the real increase in life expectancy during the PSA era remains unclear.      How have advances in screening and treatment contributed to prostate cancer death rates that have fallen by almost 30 percent since the early 1990s? And can racial disparities in patterns of care explain why mortality declines among African Americans are, only two-thirds of those among whites? We will use surveillance modeling to address these questions, building on our previous CISNET work, which modeled PSA screening. Our methods will combine simulation models and maximum likelihood analysis to address the following Specific Aims:   (1) Estimate the real improvement in life expectancy among prostate cancer cases during the PSA era;   (2) Quantify the contributions to mortality declines of PSA screening and HT, and evaluate whether the benefit of screening given growing use of HT exceeds the benefit that would be expected under standard therapies;   (3) Determine whether racial differences in PSA screening and HT can account for the different mortality declines experienced by whites and African Americans; and   (4) Address whether disease natural history differs according to race, by estimating lead times associated with PSA screening that are consistent with incidence trends in whites and African Americans.      Our models will require reliable estimates of trends in screening and treatment, which we will obtain using SEER-Medicare data, as well as patient claims data from a large HMO based in Northern California.      Through this work, our study promises to shed light on two of the most active controversies in prostate cancer research: the value of PSA screening versus advances in prostate cancer treatment, and the link between disparities in care and racial differences in prostate cancer outcomes.         ","Modeling US Prostate Cancer Trends: PSA, Treatment & Ra*",7279992,U01CA088160,"['Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Mortality Decline ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Localized ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Work ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' disease natural history ', ' California ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Today ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Accounting ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' PSA screening ', ' PSA test ', ' tumor ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Surveillance Modeling ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' CISNET ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Observational Study ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Maintenance Organizations ', ' Prepaid Group Health Organizations ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Numbers ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Funding ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,U01,2007,321275,0.3780711093835506
"Barbers Against Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this transdisciplinary and collaborative research pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of the barbershop as a communication channel for disseminating prostate cancer information and awareness for African American men over 40 years of age. This project meets NCI's objective for pilot projects in community-based participatory research (CBPR) to reduce health disparities and to develop effective community-based participatory interventions to reduce cancer health disparities that can be employed nationwide. The primary aims are to: 1) assess the feasibility of using barbershops to disseminate culturally and literacy relevant prostate cancer health messages; 2) provide systematic research training and evaluative workshops to a cadre of African American barbers to provide them with the skills to deliver culturally appropriate cancer education in the community setting grounded in the principles of CBPR; and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of the adapted Prostate Cancer Education Toolbox kit in the delivery of culturally, linguistically, and literacy relevant prostate cancer education to African American men. In partnership with Community Health Advocacy Partnership, our community collaborator, this pilot study will be conducted in three sequential phases. In Phase I, we will conduct qualitative formative research to: 1) adapt materials from the Toolbox, and 2) conduct pre-testing iterations of the educational materials, 3) consult with medical experts on the Toolbox content. In Phase II, we will: 1) further adapt the promotional materials for the Barber Health Advisors (BHAs) training, 2) train the BHAs, and 3) evaluate the training program. In Phase III, we will 1) evaluate the feasibility and the acceptability of the adapted Toolbox, 2) assess the effectiveness of BHAs, and 3) assess the utility of using barbers to disseminate prostate cancer health messages. The study employs primarily qualitative methods which includes focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and semi-structured questionnaires. Long-term, the findings from this study will be used to develop a research agenda focused on increasing the robustness of the infrastructure and communication venues for community-based cancer education among diverse audiences. The underlying philosophy of this community- based pilot project is to address the broader focus of public health, and identify effective dissemination channels for the delivery of cancer information.          ",Barbers Against Prostate Cancer,7336901,U01CA114627,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Age-Years ', ' Educational Materials ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Florida ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Structure of base of prostate ', ' Base of the Prostate ', ' Base of Human Prostate ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Perception ', ' Genetic ', ' Philosophy ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Staging ', ' Program Development ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Techniques ', ' behavior change ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Client ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer care ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' parent grant ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Variations of care in older men with prostate cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will use prostate cancer as a model to analyze variations in health resource utilization, cost of care, and factors associated with the process of chronic illness as antecedents and responses to health problems. Objective: to analyze the complex interplay of prostate cancer treatment, comorbidities, socioeconomic, hospital and physician factors and their relationships with treatment modalities, health resource utilization and direct medical care cost. Specific Aims (1): To analyze the variation in short and long term health resource utilization and direct cost of care across African American and Caucasian elderly prostate cancer patients, controlling for stage at diagnosis, physician and hospital characteristics and comorbidity. (2): To determine if differential rates of surgery (or radiation therapy) contribute to survival disparity between African American and Caucasian elderly prostate cancer patients. (3): To determine if differences in physician characteristics contribute to survival disparity between African American and Caucasian elderly prostate cancer patients. (4): To determine if differences in hospital characteristics contribute to survival disparity between African American and Caucasian elderly prostate cancer patients. Methods: We propose a cohort control design using SEER-Medicare databases. Prostate cancer patients diagnosed in 1995 or 1996 will be identified and followed retrospectively one-year pre and five years post diagnosis. Health resource utilization, treatment modalities and cost of care will be analyzed across ethnicity. Analyses will adjust for comorbidity, socioeconomic status and stage. To compute incremental cost attributable to prostate cancer, a control group of patients without cancer will be selected (matched by age, ethnicity and zip-code) from the Medicare database. Cumulative cost per patient per year will be computed and adjusted to 2005 dollars. For the prostate cancer group, total cost of care will be differentiated, as cost attributable to prostate cancer vs other diagnoses. Multivariate log linear regression models will be used to identify factors associated with direct medical cost across ethnicity. Cox proportional hazard models will be used to study the association between type of treatment and survival across ethnicity. We will use Instrumental variable approach to address the issues related to the selection bias.The outcome of this study will generate preliminary results and a working model leading to a RO1.         ",Variations of care in older men with prostate cancer,7185086,R03CA121338,"['Cox Proportional Hazards Models ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Range ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Rate ', ' Zip Code ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Output ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Resources ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Hospitals ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' disability ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Staging ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Localized ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Elderly man ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Surgeon ', ' cohort ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Modality ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' older men ', ' tumor ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2007,76365,0.3409179654259306
"EphB2 as a Prostate Cancer tumor Suppressor and Risk Factor in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in African American men. Incidence and mortality rates are disproportionately higher among African American men when compared to Caucasian men in the US. The specific factors influencing this disparity remain poorly understood. Although dietary and environmental exposures are among the culprits, evidence exist, which support a role for genetic factors. Candidate gene studies have implicated several genes as being associated with increased prostate cancer risk among African American men. One interesting candidate gene encodes the EphB2 tyrosine kinase gene. The PI and colleagues were the first to report somatic mutations and loss of function of EphB2 in sporadic prostate cancer. Furthermore, we have recently published an association between EphB2 and prostate cancer risk in African Americans. Specifically, we have demonstrated that a common germline nonsense variant in EphB2 confers a three-fold increase in risk in African American men with a positive family history of prostate cancer. Furthermore, this nonsense variant is in admixture disequilibrium in African Americans. Taken together, these and existing data implicating EphB2 in prostate cancer warrant continued investigation. Our central hypothesis is that EphB2 is a genetic risk factor and tumor suppressor gene associated with prostate cancer in African American men. Specifically, we hypothesize that common variants in EphB2 are associated with prostate cancer risk in AA men and that this locus is associated with genomic loss in tumors from AA prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, we hypothesize that a common nonsense variant associated with risk (K1019X) confers a negative functional consequence on the EphB2 protein. To test our hypothesis we are proposing the following specific aims: 1. To test the association between PC risk and germline variants in the EphB2 gene in unselected AA PC cases and controls. 2. To evaluate loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the EphB2 locus in PC tumors from familial and sporadic AA cases. 3. To perform in vitro functional analysis of the K1019X mutation by introducing a mutated EphB2 construct into EphB2 null DU145 PC cells.              ",EphB2 as a Prostate Cancer tumor Suppressor

"Understanding racial differences in the natural history of prostate cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is characterized by large racial differences in both incidence and post-diagnosis survival. Known disparities in health care access and utilization complicate uncovering underlying differences in the natural history of the disease. Such differences can be caused by racial variations in risk factors such as diet or genetic predisposition. Understanding and quantifying them is important for the development of health policies. We propose to use modeling techniques to estimate the manner and extent of racial differences in the natural history of prostate cancer. Our model uses the dynamics of prostate cancer incidence after the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening to obtain information about the preclinical stage of the disease. We will rely on the SEER-Medicare database for detailed estimates of prostate cancer incidence and screening behavior. Our specific aims are to estimate age- and race-specific rates of transurethral resection of the prostate and PSA tests in the SEER 9 registries; to develop a model for screening behavior variability; to develop a model for prostate cancer incidence; and, finally, to use the models and the screening dissemination data to assess similarities and differences in the natural history of prostate cancer between blacks and whites.         ",Understanding racial differences in the natural history of prostate cancer,7229944,R21CA114361,"['Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Calendar ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Future ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Natural History ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Staging ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Registries ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' prostate transurethral resection ', ' prostate gland transurethral resection ', ' Transurethral Prostatic Resection ', ' Transurethral Prostatectomy ', ' Work ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' disease natural history ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2007,20325,0.3414636410421533
"Determinants of Disparity in Prostate Cancer Outcomes    This Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) is being proposed to address significant gaps in our knowledge about factors that predict prostate cancer outcomes, and in particular the causes of disparity in prostate cancer outcomes between men of African and Caucasian descent. The mission of the proposed center is to 1) study the complex interaction of biological, clinical, behavioral, and environmental factors predictive of outcomes following a prostate cancer diagnosis, 2) evaluate how these factors explain disparities in prostate cancer outcomes by etnicity, and 3) disseminate this information to at-risk populations and the public health community. The CPHHD builds on our existing multidisciplinary research resources that include studies of the genetics, quality of life, patterns of care, physical environment, and social environment after the diagnosis of prostate cancer. This research requires transdisciplinary collaboration across molecular biology, genetic epidemiology, sociology, the behavioral sciences, and health policy. The proposed research has implications for clinical and public health practice, with potential to catalyze critical improvements in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. The CPHHD will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To undertake four highly interrelated research projects aimed at identifying factors that influence prostate cancer outcomes. These projects will evaluate the role of behavioral and environmental factors associated with physician and patient screening practices, screening behavior and genotypes on prostate cancer clinical outcomes, social and environmental factors on quality of life, and discrimination on treatment and medical outcomes after prostate cancer diagnoses. Specific Aim 2: To create three specialized cores to serve the needs of the CPHHD. These include: (1) an Administration Core to oversee and evaluate the CPHHD; (2) a Community Education and Dissemination Core to facilitate ongoing interactions with our community partners, and and to translate the information gained from this research to the public health community and general population; and (3) a Biomedical Informatics Core to provide integrated data management and to construct a comprehensive model of the multivariate biological, behavioral, social, and  environmental factors on prostate cancer outcomes. Specific Aim 3: To solicit and support a series of focused high priority developmental (pilot) research projects. These projects will be chosen to extend the primary research projects to additional studies of cancer screening, biological interactions, statistical model building for the integration of complex data from various disciplines. The goal of these developmental projects is to expand the scope of the research proposed in the four Projects described here and to enhance the multidisciplinary research team with members representing additional disciplines and expertise.

"CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY SERVIC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) was established in 1999 at Clark Atlanta University to carry-out basic research in cancer biology and drug discovery. In 2004, the CCRTD decided to concentrate in the area of prostate cancer due to disproportionately higher incidence and mortality rate of this disease in African-American men. The current proposal requests support to establish a Center of Excellence in prostate cancer research, education and community education. The main objectives of this center will be 1) To carry out high quality basic research in cell and molecular biology of prostate cancer and to identify underlying biological reasons for racial disparities, 2) To establish a research training program for undergraduate and graduate students to provide research training in the area of prostate cancer and hence increase the number of minority (primarily African-American) scientists in this area of research, 3) To establish a community-based educational program for raising awareness on prevention, screening, early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. This goal will be achieved in collaboration with Clark Atlanta University Whitney M. Young, Jr. School of Social Work, Division of Communication Arts and Midtown Urology Educational Foundation. In the Research Core, we propose three research projects and 6 pilot projects focusing on prostate cancer cell and molecular biology and racial disparities. In the Training Core, we are requesting support for training of three graduate and 5 undergraduate students in the area of cancer biology and community service. In the Community Outreach/Education Core, we are requesting support to establish community events for free health screening for African-American men, for holding ""Town Hall"" educational meetings to be broadcast by the CAU-TV and radio stations, to develop public service announcements, and for hosting community events in conjunction with our annual national symposium on prostate cancer. The overall activities of the center will be monitored by the Administrative Core. The activities of the Administrative Core will be overseen by the Institutional (IAC), External (EAC) and Local External (LEAC) Advisory Committees. The long term goals of the center will be to understand the biology of prostate cancer, to increase the number of African-American scientists in cancer research, and to educate the African-American community in the areas of prostate cancer prevention, early detection and treatment.              ","CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY SERVIC",7504087,P20MD002285,[''],NIMHD,CLARK ATLANTA UNIVERSITY,P20,2008,1710066,0.3356848690564944
"Oxidative Stress, Antioxidants and Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This career development award will provide crucial training and experience in population genetics, bioinformatics, haplotyping, and tag SNP identification for Cathryn Bock, Ph.D. She is an Assistant Professor at Karmanos Cancer Institute and Wayne State University, proposing formal training and research under the mentorship of Ann Schwartz, Ph.D. and Rick Kittles, Ph.D., who have considerable expertise in these areas. In addition to attending relevant classes, seminars, and meetings, she will examine genes in the oxidative stress pathway, antioxidant intake and their potential interaction effects on racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence and progression in a sample of African American (AA) and European American men from metropolitan Detroit. Despite the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with prostate cancer, neither the etiology of the disease is not well characterized, nor are the large racial disparities. Oxidative stress has been proposed as one mechanism of prostate cancer initiation and progression, and early evidence supports this hypothesis. However, the specific role of genes in the oxidative stress pathway and their interactions with dietary and supplemental antioxidants are not yet well understood. Furthermore, it is possible that some of the racial differences in prostate cancer risk and progression may be explained by differences in genes involved in the oxidative stress pathway and their interaction with antioxidant intake. Therefore, this study will first estimate ancestry of the AA subjects using ancestry-informative markers from a previous study. Tag SNPs in three genes in the oxidative stress pathway, SOD2, OGG1, and GPX1 will then be identified. We will next assess whether variation in these genes modifies prostate cancer risk associated with intake of the antioxidants vitamin E, selenium and lycopene. Furthermore, each of these potential interactions will be examined by race and by prostate cancer aggressiveness to see if these oxidative stress pathway measures explain racial differences or disease progression. All analyses within the AA men will control for ancestry. DMA for analysis, interview, questionnaire, and medical record data will come from participants in an existing case-control study of prostate cancer in which enrollment recently was completed (PI: Benjamin A. Rybicki, Ph.D.). There are 275 AA men and 362 EA men with prostate cancer and 99 AA and 125 EA age- and race-matched men without prostate cancer enrolled in the case-control study with available data and blood samples and eligible for inclusion. This training is essential for Dr. Bock's transition to being an independent researcher in the genetic epidemiology of cancer. The identification of genetic markers for prostate cancer risk and progression, and of racial differences in the interaction of these markers with intake of antioxidants will improve screening techniques and prevention targeting efforts.          ","Oxidative Stress, Antioxidants and Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer",7494506,K07CA119109,"['Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' OGG1 gene ', ' OGH1 Gene ', ' OGG1 ', ' N-Glycosylase/DNA Lyase Gene ', ' MUTM Gene ', ' MMH Gene ', ' SOD2 gene ', ' SOD2 ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Intake ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Gene-Modified ', ' Oxidative Stress Pathway ', ' Oxidative Stress Induced Gene Expression Via Nrf2 ', ' 8-oxoguanine ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Age ', ' glutathione peroxidase ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Medical Records ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentorship ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Superoxide Dismutase ', ' cytocuprein ', ' Hemocuprein ', ' Erythrocuprein ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Techniques ', ' Class ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' professor ', ' metropolitan ', ' lycopene ', ' psi,psi-carotene ', ' Lyc-O-Mato ', ' Participant ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' Selenium/vitamin E ', ' Population ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,K07,2008,133111,0.3131696686278995

The RCMI program at CAU over the last 20 years has been vital for the development of infrastructure for biomedical research by providing state-of-the-art equipment, recruitment of faculty and resources for individual researchers. The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) was created in 1999 with support from the RCMI program. CCRTD faculty belongs to the Departments of Biology, Chemistry and School of Education with research interests in cancer biology, drug discovery and behavioral aspects of cancer. During the current funding period, CCRTD decided to focus on the development of a nationally-recognized research program in prostate cancer. As a part of this initiative, CAU recruited three new faculty members with research programs focused on prostate cancer research and education.       The well-defined and focused activities at CCRTD have resulted in increased productivity and the stature of biomedical research at CAU. During the next funding period, we will continue to expand and enhance our research activities to achieve the goals of building a world class Center dedicated to research in prostate cancer and its impact in the African American community. The proposed specific goals are: 1) to develop and expand current research core facilities vital for carrying out research on the cellular and molecular biology of prostate cancer and 2) to recruit additional faculty who will further strengthen CCRTD. To provide additional support to CCRTD investigators, we propose to establish two new core units within CCRTD Research Support Core Facilities: Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core and Analytical Core. We also propose to recruit three additional faculty members who will be committed to high caliber research in prostate cancer biology and chemistry. Additional faculty is imperative to achieve a critical mass of scientists working in a collaborative and synergistic environment to create a world class center in prostate cancer research at CAU. This will be a unique Center of its kind at an HBCU.      Prostate cancer affects the African American community disproportionately.

"EphB2 as a Prostate Cancer tumor Suppressor and Risk Factor in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in African American men. Incidence and mortality rates are disproportionately higher among African American men when compared to Caucasian men in the US. The specific factors influencing this disparity remain poorly understood. Although dietary and environmental exposures are among the culprits, evidence exist, which support a role for genetic factors. Candidate gene studies have implicated several genes as being associated with increased prostate cancer risk among African American men. One interesting candidate gene encodes the EphB2 tyrosine kinase gene. The PI and colleagues were the first to report somatic mutations and loss of function of EphB2 in sporadic prostate cancer. Furthermore, we have recently published an association between EphB2 and prostate cancer risk in African Americans. Specifically, we have demonstrated that a common germline nonsense variant in EphB2 confers a three-fold increase in risk in African American men with a positive family history of prostate cancer. Furthermore, this nonsense variant is in admixture disequilibrium in African Americans. Taken together, these and existing data implicating EphB2 in prostate cancer warrant continued investigation. Our central hypothesis is that EphB2 is a genetic risk factor and tumor suppressor gene associated with prostate cancer in African American men. Specifically, we hypothesize that common variants in EphB2 are associated with prostate cancer risk in AA men and that this locus is associated with genomic loss in tumors from AA prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, we hypothesize that a common nonsense variant associated with risk (K1019X) confers a negative functional consequence on the EphB2 protein. To test our hypothesis we are proposing the following specific aims: 1. To test the association between PC risk and germline variants in the EphB2 gene in unselected AA PC cases and controls. 2. To evaluate loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the EphB2 locus in PC tumors from familial and sporadic AA cases. 3. To perform in vitro functional analysis of the K1019X mutation by introducing a mutated EphB2 construct into EphB2 null DU145 PC cells.              ",EphB2 as a Prostate Cancer tumor Suppressor

"Prostate Cancer Clinical Decision Making by Diagnosed and High Risk Latino Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer and second leading cause of death among men in the United States, and Latinos are the fastest growing minority in the United States. However, low income Latino men are more likely to be uninsured, have less education, and have lower incomes. Many do not speak English as their first language. For these men, much of the available information to help with informed decision-making is not accessible. Because of the lack of consensus on the benefits of screening on prostate cancer mortality or of superior survival benefit of any one treatment for early stage prostate cancer, men are faced with life-altering decisions regarding screening and treatment for those who are diagnosed. Furthermore, men with a first degree relative with prostate cancer are at increased risk. Yet, how the rapidly growing population of Latino men approaches the decision-making process in prostate cancer is virtually   unknown. Therefore, the overall purpose of this study is to develop descriptive models of prostate cancer screening, treatment, and diagnosis disclosure decision-making from the perspective of Latino men to form an evidence base for the development of culturally appropriate intervention strategies to facilitate informed and confident decision-making. Specifically, we aim to: 1. Describe the process of deciding on treatment and disclosing diagnosis from the perspective of Latino men who have been treated for prostate cancer and 2. Describe the process of deciding to be screened or not screened for prostate cancer by brothers or sons of Latino men diagnosed with prostate cancer. We will use qualitative descriptive methods to understand prostate cancer treatment, disclosure, and screening decision-making processes from the perspective of Latino men. Both specific aims will be addressed with in-depth individual interviews exploring involvement in and comfort with treatment decision making   process, influences on the decision, and disclosure of diagnosis by treated men. For high risk men we   will explore risk perception, knowledge and beliefs about prostate cancer screening, sources of information, facilitators and barriers, and decision implementation. Analyses will result in clear, in-depth descriptions that will guide the future development of intervention strategies to facilitate informed decision-making regarding prostate cancer treatment, disclosure, and screening among Latino men facing prostate cancer decisions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of this study to public health lies in the fact that Latinos are the fastest growing minority in the United States and Mexican/Mexican-Americans make up over 70% of this growing Latino population. Understanding how treatment, disclosure, and screening decisions are made by Mexican/Mexican-American men from this research will lay the foundation for culturally relevant interventions to assist these men as they face life-altering decisions. Potentially, informed, confident decision-making participation may contribute to   better treatment outcomes and appropriate screening for this disadvantaged group of men.             ",Prostate Cancer Clinical Decision Making by Diagnosed and High Risk Latino Men,7531018,R21NR010383,"['Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' First Degree Relative ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Depth ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Language ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Mexican ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' Immigrant ', ' Review Literature ', ' Perception ', ' Staging ', ' Brothers ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Son ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Caucasians ', ' Writing ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' Belief ', ' experience ', ' California ', ' Reporting ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Uninsured ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Minority ', ' social disparities ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', "" men's group "", ' male group ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2008,192500,0.3201592621591067
"Decision Making in Unaffected First-Degree Relatives of Prostate Cancer Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The use of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test in the general population and identifiable high-risk subgroups remains controversial, and the PSA test remains the only available test to date to detect early prostate cancer. Because of the controversy, many men who are likely to develop prostate cancer including African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer, remain uncertain about whether to take the PSA test or not to take the test; and often make these decisions without the benefit of an informed decision aid. Male first-degree relatives (FDRs) of prostate cancer patients (particularly brothers and sons) are known to be at increased risk for the disease, yet virtually no screening informed decision making aids have been developed specifically to help these men become informed about the disease and to decide about getting the PSA test or not getting the PSA test. The specific aims of this application are to (1) develop a targeted intervention to promote informed screening decision making for FDRs; (2) conduct a small pilot study to assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the ehanced decision aid. Our study design will involve two phases. The first phase of the study will involve focus groups and interviews with prostate cancer patients and their first-degree relatives (brothers and sons) to develop the content of a supplemental digital video disc (DVD) to accompany the existing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) decision making booklet. The supplemental DVD will include content developed specifically to address information needs and the multiple concurrent risk factors faced by FDRs. The second phase will be a single arm pilot study to test the new enhanced intervention (EI) consisting of CDC booklet plus new supplemental DVD. We will examine feasibility, acceptability, and how well the materials work (efficacy) in FDRs. The primary analysis will include examination of pre and post-intervention changes in knowledge, risk perception, screening decision made/intentions, decisional conflict (difficulty in decision making), satisfaction with decision, and intervention use. If successfully completed, the proposed project may lead to a future R01 application for a larger randomized, controlled intervention study to test the broad usefulness of the new decision aid (compared to standard materials) in promoting informed decision making. The ultimate goal of this line of research is to reduce prostate cancer disparities and disease burden.      Public Health Relevance: Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American men. The greatest burden of new cases and deaths from prostate cancer is experienced by African American men and men with a positive family history of the disease. Prostate cancer can be detected early with digital rectal exam (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test, yet the general use of PSA screening remains controversial and many men who are at high risk (e.g., men of African descent and men with a positive family history of prostate cancer) remain uncertain about whether to be tested or not. We seek to develop a decision aid (educational DVD) to help men with a positive family history of prostate cancer make informed decisions about testing, with the ultimate goal of reducing the burden of prostate cancer.          ",Decision Making in Unaffected First-Degree Relatives of Prostate Cancer Patients,7468736,R21CA125428,"['Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Caribbean natives ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Range ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' First Degree Relative ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Intention ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' rectal ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Distress ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Numbers ', ' African ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' satisfaction ', ' Sample Size ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' prostate cancer prevention ', ' Prostate CA Prevention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Staging ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' Brothers ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Son ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Upper arm ', ' size ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' videodisc ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Comparative Study ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' neglect ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' comparative ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Determinants of Disparity in Prostate Cancer Outcomes    This Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) is being proposed to address significant gaps in our knowledge about factors that predict prostate cancer outcomes, and in particular the causes of disparity in prostate cancer outcomes between men of African and Caucasian descent. The mission of the proposed center is to 1) study the complex interaction of biological, clinical, behavioral, and environmental factors predictive of outcomes following a prostate cancer diagnosis, 2) evaluate how these factors explain disparities in prostate cancer outcomes by etnicity, and 3) disseminate this information to at-risk populations and the public health community. The CPHHD builds on our existing multidisciplinary research resources that include studies of the genetics, quality of life, patterns of care, physical environment, and social environment after the diagnosis of prostate cancer. This research requires transdisciplinary collaboration across molecular biology, genetic epidemiology, sociology, the behavioral sciences, and health policy. The proposed research has implications for clinical and public health practice, with potential to catalyze critical improvements in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. The CPHHD will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To undertake four highly interrelated research projects aimed at identifying factors that influence prostate cancer outcomes. These projects will evaluate the role of behavioral and environmental factors associated with physician and patient screening practices, screening behavior and genotypes on prostate cancer clinical outcomes, social and environmental factors on quality of life, and discrimination on treatment and medical outcomes after prostate cancer diagnoses. Specific Aim 2: To create three specialized cores to serve the needs of the CPHHD. These include: (1) an Administration Core to oversee and evaluate the CPHHD; (2) a Community Education and Dissemination Core to facilitate ongoing interactions with our community partners, and and to translate the information gained from this research to the public health community and general population; and (3) a Biomedical Informatics Core to provide integrated data management and to construct a comprehensive model of the multivariate biological, behavioral, social, and  environmental factors on prostate cancer outcomes. Specific Aim 3: To solicit and support a series of focused high priority developmental (pilot) research projects. These projects will be chosen to extend the primary research projects to additional studies of cancer screening, biological interactions, statistical model building for the integration of complex data from various disciplines. The goal of these developmental projects is to expand the scope of the research proposed in the four Projects described here and to enhance the multidisciplinary research team with members representing additional disciplines and expertise.

"Improving Patient Outcomes Through System Navigation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this application is to address a national priority in cancer control research by developing and conducting a highly innovative patient navigation program from the point of abnormal screening test to treatment for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. The major venue for this program of research will be the Denver Health Medical Center (DH), which is the single largest ""safety net"" health care system linked to a major metropolitan area in the Rocky Mountain Region. DH serves a large number of minority (75%) and underserved patients (almost half without insurance). Unique features of this research are: (1) testing for efficacy and cost-effectiveness a comprehensive patient navigator program that will extend an existing and exemplary community lay health worker demonstration project at DH (Community Voices); (2) combining this resource with a well-established telephone counseling service to specifically address patient-centered psychosocial barriers; and (3) integrating these components into a comprehensive patient navigator program within the context of the healthcare provider institution.   The following specific aims will guide the evaluation of this program: (1) to reduce the time between an abnormal screening test for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers to a positive or negative pathologic diagnosis; (2) to reduce the time from a positive pathologic diagnosis of breast, colorectal or prostate cancers to the start of therapy; (3) to increase the proportion of these patients adhering to recommendations for care, including completion of additional diagnostic tests, consultation appointments, and completion of treatment; (4) to improve patient reported outcomes of medical self-efficacy, satisfaction with care and distress related to cancer diagnosis in a sample of individuals with a negative pathologic diagnosis and among all individuals with a positive pathologic diagnosis; and (5) to examine the cost-effectiveness and return on investment of patient navigation. Ultimately we will demonstrate the efficacy and assess the financial impact associated with the implementation of a comprehensive navigation program designed to address disparities in cancer-related outcomes among the poor and underserved         ",Improving Patient Outcomes Through System Navigation,7499022,U01CA116903,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Range ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Pathologic ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Insurance ', ' Investments ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' satisfaction ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Appointment ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' programs ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Uninsured ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Navigation System ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' Consultations ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NCI,DENVER HEALTH AND HOSPITAL AUTHORITY,U01,2008,969010,0.13026754015250722
"Modeling US Prostate Cancer Trends: PSA, Treatment & Ra*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This study aims to determine the population impact of changing strategies for prostate cancer control, by linking trends in disease incidence and mortality with trends in screening and treatment.      The advent of PSA screening has transformed the way in which prostate cancer is detected and managed in the US.  Today, the majority of prostate cancers in this country are screen-detected and localized. Increasing numbers of newly-diagnosed cases are being treated with hormone suppression therapy (HT), which has traditionally been reserved for advanced tumors. Cause-specific survival among prostate cancer cases has increased dramatically, but the real increase in life expectancy during the PSA era remains unclear.      How have advances in screening and treatment contributed to prostate cancer death rates that have fallen by almost 30 percent since the early 1990s? And can racial disparities in patterns of care explain why mortality declines among African Americans are, only two-thirds of those among whites? We will use surveillance modeling to address these questions, building on our previous CISNET work, which modeled PSA screening. Our methods will combine simulation models and maximum likelihood analysis to address the following Specific Aims:   (1) Estimate the real improvement in life expectancy among prostate cancer cases during the PSA era;   (2) Quantify the contributions to mortality declines of PSA screening and HT, and evaluate whether the benefit of screening given growing use of HT exceeds the benefit that would be expected under standard therapies;   (3) Determine whether racial differences in PSA screening and HT can account for the different mortality declines experienced by whites and African Americans; and   (4) Address whether disease natural history differs according to race, by estimating lead times associated with PSA screening that are consistent with incidence trends in whites and African Americans.      Our models will require reliable estimates of trends in screening and treatment, which we will obtain using SEER-Medicare data, as well as patient claims data from a large HMO based in Northern California.      Through this work, our study promises to shed light on two of the most active controversies in prostate cancer research: the value of PSA screening versus advances in prostate cancer treatment, and the link between disparities in care and racial differences in prostate cancer outcomes.         ","Modeling US Prostate Cancer Trends: PSA, Treatment & Ra*",7498479,U01CA088160,"['Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Surveillance Modeling ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' CISNET ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Observational Study ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Maintenance Organizations ', ' Prepaid Group Health Organizations ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Numbers ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Funding ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Mortality Decline ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Localized ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Work ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' disease natural history ', ' California ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Today ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Accounting ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' PSA screening ', ' PSA test ', ' tumor ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,U01,2008,255841,0.3780711093835506
"Prostate Cancer Recovery Enhancement (PROCARE) for African American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Challenging sexual, urinary, and bowel symptoms are common after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and often persist well beyond the acute treatment and recovery period. When symptoms persist, reducing symptom distress and increasing quality of life are important symptom management goals. Symptom management efforts have traditionally focused on the patient. However, partners and the relationship are also affected when survivors experience distressing sexual, urinary, and bowel symptoms. Among African American men and their partners, the burden of symptom distress may be even greater. African American men have a 60 percent higher incidence rate of prostate cancer, more advanced disease at diagnosis, and mortality rates twice as high as those seen in Caucasian men. Research also indicates that African American men recover more slowly after treatment for prostate cancer. The proposed study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of a new, telephone-based coping skills training protocol tailored for African American prostate cancer survivors and their intimate partners. One hundred and eighty nine early stage African American prostate cancer survivors (stage T1-T3) and their intimate partners will be randomized to 1 of 3 conditions: 1) a 6-session partner-assisted Coping Skills Training (CST) intervention; 2) a Cancer Education intervention of equal duration, or 3) a wait-list control condition. Survivors will complete measures of symptom-related quality of life, depression, self-efficacy, and relationship quality at 3 time-points: pre- treatment, post-treatment, and 3-months follow-up. Partners will complete measures of caregiver strain, depression, self efficacy and relationship quality at the same 3 time points. If we find that partner-assisted CST is effective in African American prostate cancer survivors who have undergone prostatectomy surgery, future studies could evaluate partner-assisted CST in African American prostate cancer survivors who have undergone radiation therapies (for example, brachytherapy). Future studies could also evaluate partner-assisted CST in other populations of African American cancer survivors where large ethnic disparities in incidence and mortality rates exist, such as lung cancer, and colon cancer. Ultimately, by rigorously evaluating an intervention to enhance coping in African American prostate cancer survivors at increased risk for being underserved, this study may enlarge our repertoire of methods for reducing symptom distress and increasing quality of life for cancer survivors who are most in need.           ",Prostate Cancer Recovery Enhancement (PROCARE) for African American Men,7627061,R01CA122704,"['Couples ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Prostate Cancer Progress Review Group ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' urinary ', ' symptom management ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Incidence ', ' Intestines ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Distress ', ' Recovery ', ' Literature ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Funding ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Patients ', ' Staging ', ' Disruption ', ' Prostatectomy ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' survivorship ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Caucasians ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Brachytherapy ', ' Radioisotope Brachytherapy ', ' Radiation Brachytherapy ', ' Curietherapy ', ' intimate behavior ', ' intimacy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NCI,EAST CAROLINA UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,393037,0.24655902895384058

"Improving Patient Outcomes Through System Navigation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this application is to address a national priority in cancer control research by developing and conducting a highly innovative patient navigation program from the point of abnormal screening test to treatment for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. The major venue for this program of research will be the Denver Health Medical Center (DH), which is the single largest ""safety net"" health care system linked to a major metropolitan area in the Rocky Mountain Region. DH serves a large number of minority (75%) and underserved patients (almost half without insurance). Unique features of this research are: (1) testing for efficacy and cost-effectiveness a comprehensive patient navigator program that will extend an existing and exemplary community lay health worker demonstration project at DH (Community Voices); (2) combining this resource with a well-established telephone counseling service to specifically address patient-centered psychosocial barriers; and (3) integrating these components into a comprehensive patient navigator program within the context of the healthcare provider institution.   The following specific aims will guide the evaluation of this program: (1) to reduce the time between an abnormal screening test for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers to a positive or negative pathologic diagnosis; (2) to reduce the time from a positive pathologic diagnosis of breast, colorectal or prostate cancers to the start of therapy; (3) to increase the proportion of these patients adhering to recommendations for care, including completion of additional diagnostic tests, consultation appointments, and completion of treatment; (4) to improve patient reported outcomes of medical self-efficacy, satisfaction with care and distress related to cancer diagnosis in a sample of individuals with a negative pathologic diagnosis and among all individuals with a positive pathologic diagnosis; and (5) to examine the cost-effectiveness and return on investment of patient navigation. Ultimately we will demonstrate the efficacy and assess the financial impact associated with the implementation of a comprehensive navigation program designed to address disparities in cancer-related outcomes among the poor and underserved         ",Improving Patient Outcomes Through System Navigation,7677297,U01CA116903,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Pathologic ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Insurance ', ' Investments ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Appointment ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' programs ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Uninsured ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Navigation System ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' group intervention ', ' primary care setting ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' cancer initiation ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Consultations ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NCI,DENVER HEALTH AND HOSPITAL AUTHORITY,U01,2009,910501,0.13026754015250722
"Assessing Localized Prostate Cancer Post-Treatment Outcomes Among Gay Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite including sexual orientation as a source of disparity in Healthy People 2010, public health research on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations has been lacking for the past 20 years, especially research that is not related to sexually transmitted diseases. This is of concern in prostate cancer treatment, with its manifold impacts on male quality of life. The very substantial body of research on the complex physical and psychosocial outcomes of treatment has traditionally assumed a heterosexual frame of reference. This is problematic when patient centered measures attempt to assess important changes in physical function associated with treatment. It is especially limiting when attention turns, as it has in recent years, to how changes in sexual function, which affect the majority of men who pursue active treatment, are appreciated in terms of how they affect the emotional and social well-being of men. All men are at risk of prostate cancer regardless of sexual orientation, but the experiences of gay men are unknown. Gay men may have difficulty dealing with heterosexually oriented urologists and oncologists, which may undermine the supportive dialog that facilitates satisfying treatment decisions and outcomes. To ensure the successful recruitment of gay men, many of whom are reluctant to self-identify as such in a traditional clinical setting, a variety of recruitment approaches will be used. Thus, this study will: (1) revise recently developed measures of physical and psychosocial domains of prostate cancer-related quality of life to better assess the experiences of gay men; and (2) assess post-treatment prostate cancer quality of life outcomes among gay men. These findings will inform the development of a quality of life model that takes into account the role of sexual orientation in prostate cancer treatment outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This study will continue a line of research developing a biopsychosocial model of the outcomes of treatment for prostate cancer that began with studies conducted by Talcott, Clark and their colleagues, along with many others. While these studies have shown that sexual and other bodily changes ramify broadly following prostate cancer treatment, our appreciation of these effects has been severely limited by sampling only heterosexual men. The proposed study seeks to remedy this deficit and develop a more comprehensive model of quality of life, based on inclusion of gay men, that can help inform clinicians performing prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment of quality of life outcomes that may be unique to gay men with localized prostate cancer.           This study will continue a line of research developing a biopsychosocial model of the outcomes of treatment for prostate cancer that began with studies conducted by Talcott, Clark and their colleagues, along with many others.

"Clark Atlanta University Biomedical Science Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical research at Clark Atlanta University (CAU) has been supported by the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)/National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Research Center in Minority Institutions (RCMI) program since 1985. The RCMI program at CAU over the last 20 years has been vital for the development of infrastructure for biomedical research by providing state-of-the-art equipment, recruitment of faculty and resources for individual researchers. The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) was created in 1999 with support from the RCMI program. CCRTD faculty belongs to the Departments of Biology, Chemistry and School of Education with research interests in cancer biology, drug discovery and behavioral aspects of cancer. During the current funding period, CCRTD decided to focus on the development of a nationally-recognized research program in prostate cancer. As a part of this initiative, CAU recruited three new faculty members with research programs focused on prostate cancer research and education.       The well-defined and focused activities at CCRTD have resulted in increased productivity and the stature of biomedical research at CAU. During the next funding period, we will continue to expand and enhance our research activities to achieve the goals of building a world class Center dedicated to research in prostate cancer and its impact in the African American community. The proposed specific goals are: 1) to develop and expand current research core facilities vital for carrying out research on the cellular and molecular biology of prostate cancer and 2) to recruit additional faculty who will further strengthen CCRTD. To provide additional support to CCRTD investigators, we propose to establish two new core units within CCRTD Research Support Core Facilities: Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core and Analytical Core. We also propose to recruit three additional faculty members who will be committed to high caliber research in prostate cancer biology and chemistry. Additional faculty is imperative to achieve a critical mass of scientists working in a collaborative and synergistic environment to create a world class center in prostate cancer research at CAU. This will be a unique Center of its kind at an HBCU.      Prostate cancer affects the African American community disproportionately. There is an increased incidence/mortality rate for African American men; however the reason for this is unknown.

"Modeling US Prostate Cancer Trends: PSA, Treatment & Ra*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This study aims to determine the population impact of changing strategies for prostate cancer control, by linking trends in disease incidence and mortality with trends in screening and treatment.      The advent of PSA screening has transformed the way in which prostate cancer is detected and managed in the US.  Today, the majority of prostate cancers in this country are screen-detected and localized. Increasing numbers of newly-diagnosed cases are being treated with hormone suppression therapy (HT), which has traditionally been reserved for advanced tumors. Cause-specific survival among prostate cancer cases has increased dramatically, but the real increase in life expectancy during the PSA era remains unclear.      How have advances in screening and treatment contributed to prostate cancer death rates that have fallen by almost 30 percent since the early 1990s? And can racial disparities in patterns of care explain why mortality declines among African Americans are, only two-thirds of those among whites? We will use surveillance modeling to address these questions, building on our previous CISNET work, which modeled PSA screening. Our methods will combine simulation models and maximum likelihood analysis to address the following Specific Aims:   (1) Estimate the real improvement in life expectancy among prostate cancer cases during the PSA era;   (2) Quantify the contributions to mortality declines of PSA screening and HT, and evaluate whether the benefit of screening given growing use of HT exceeds the benefit that would be expected under standard therapies;   (3) Determine whether racial differences in PSA screening and HT can account for the different mortality declines experienced by whites and African Americans; and   (4) Address whether disease natural history differs according to race, by estimating lead times associated with PSA screening that are consistent with incidence trends in whites and African Americans.      Our models will require reliable estimates of trends in screening and treatment, which we will obtain using SEER-Medicare data, as well as patient claims data from a large HMO based in Northern California.      Through this work, our study promises to shed light on two of the most active controversies in prostate cancer research: the value of PSA screening versus advances in prostate cancer treatment, and the link between disparities in care and racial differences in prostate cancer outcomes.

"Prostate Cancer Clinical Decision Making by Diagnosed and High Risk Latino Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer and second leading cause of death among men in the United States, and Latinos are the fastest growing minority in the United States. However, low income Latino men are more likely to be uninsured, have less education, and have lower incomes. Many do not speak English as their first language. For these men, much of the available information to help with informed decision-making is not accessible. Because of the lack of consensus on the benefits of screening on prostate cancer mortality or of superior survival benefit of any one treatment for early stage prostate cancer, men are faced with life-altering decisions regarding screening and treatment for those who are diagnosed. Furthermore, men with a first degree relative with prostate cancer are at increased risk. Yet, how the rapidly growing population of Latino men approaches the decision-making process in prostate cancer is virtually   unknown. Therefore, the overall purpose of this study is to develop descriptive models of prostate cancer screening, treatment, and diagnosis disclosure decision-making from the perspective of Latino men to form an evidence base for the development of culturally appropriate intervention strategies to facilitate informed and confident decision-making. Specifically, we aim to: 1. Describe the process of deciding on treatment and disclosing diagnosis from the perspective of Latino men who have been treated for prostate cancer and 2. Describe the process of deciding to be screened or not screened for prostate cancer by brothers or sons of Latino men diagnosed with prostate cancer. We will use qualitative descriptive methods to understand prostate cancer treatment, disclosure, and screening decision-making processes from the perspective of Latino men. Both specific aims will be addressed with in-depth individual interviews exploring involvement in and comfort with treatment decision making   process, influences on the decision, and disclosure of diagnosis by treated men. For high risk men we   will explore risk perception, knowledge and beliefs about prostate cancer screening, sources of information, facilitators and barriers, and decision implementation. Analyses will result in clear, in-depth descriptions that will guide the future development of intervention strategies to facilitate informed decision-making regarding prostate cancer treatment, disclosure, and screening among Latino men facing prostate cancer decisions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of this study to public health lies in the fact that Latinos are the fastest growing minority in the United States and Mexican/Mexican-Americans make up over 70% of this growing Latino population. Understanding how treatment, disclosure, and screening decisions are made by Mexican/Mexican-American men from this research will lay the foundation for culturally relevant interventions to assist these men as they face life-altering decisions. Potentially, informed, confident decision-making participation may contribute to   better treatment outcomes and appropriate screening for this disadvantaged group of men.             ",Prostate Cancer Clinical Decision Making by Diagnosed and High Risk Latino Men,7693849,R21NR010383,"['Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' First Degree Relative ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Language ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Mexican ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' Immigrant ', ' Review Literature ', ' Perception ', ' Staging ', ' Brothers ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Son ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Caucasians ', ' Writing ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' Belief ', ' experience ', ' California ', ' Reporting ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' risk perception ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Uninsured ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Minority ', ' social disparities ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', "" men's group "", ' male group ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2009,231000,0.3201592621591067
"A Genome-wide Association Study of Prostate Cancer in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among men. At the moment, we do not understand the underlying etiology, or why different groups, such as African Americans, have higher rates of disease. Risk factors for prostate cancer have remained elusive and aside from age, having a family history of the disease or African ancestry, until recently, no genetic or non-genetic (i.e., lifestyle) risk factors have been consistently demonstrated to contribute to variation in disease risk in the population. In this application, we propose to undertake a large-scale collaborative effort to uncover genetic predictors of prostate cancer in African American men. For this effort, we have assembled a multi-institutional team of investigators with experience in prostate cancer research in minority populations who are eager and willing to pool resources, specimens and data from their established studies, and to work closely together towards a common goal. To identify genetic factors that contribute to prostate cancer risk in African American men we propose to conduct a well-powered multi-stage genome-wide association study. In stage 1 we will genotype 1,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,500 African American prostate cancer cases and 1,500 controls. In stage 2 we will perform follow-up genotyping of 24,000 SNPs that demonstrate significant main effects and interactions with known risk variants for prostate cancer (e.g. 8q24) in an additional 1,626 African American cases and 1,867 controls. In stage 3, we will further examine genetic associations from stage 1+2 in an additional 1,124 African American cases and 1,163 controls. In this study we will also assess the pan-ethnic effects of the variants identify in the African American scan, by replication testing in 3,900 prostate cancer cases and 4,350 controls of West African, Japanese, Latino and European American ancestry. In this dataset, we will also examine interactions between associated variants, environmental factors (thereby better defining the role of these factors) and disease severity. We expect this work to significantly advance knowledge of the etiology of prostate cancer and racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer risk, and to guide the development of future preventive, early detection, prognostic and even therapeutic measures. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to identify common risk alleles for prostate cancer in African American men. For this effort, we have assembled a multi-institutional team of investigators with experience in prostate cancer research in minority populations who are eager and willing to pool resources, specimens and data from their established studies, and to work closely together towards a common goal. More specifically, we propose to conduct a multi-stage genome-wide association study of prostate cancer, which will include 4,250 African American cases and 4,530 African American male controls. We will examine the pan-ethnic effects of associated variants in other racial/ethnic populations as well as incorporate environment and lifestyle risk factors in association testing to assist in better defining the subgroups of the African American population at greatest risk of developing this common cancer. We expect findings from this work to guide the development of future preventive, early detection and prognostic strategies.                         ",A Genome-wide Association Study of Prostate Cancer in African Americans,7564863,U01CA136792,"['Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' genetic association ', ' Environment ', ' Preventive ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Subgroup ', ' 8q24 ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Africa ', ' Genotype ', ' Age ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' prognostic ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese American ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Policies ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Smoking ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Work ', ' Scanning ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Breast ', ' lycopene ', ' psi,psi-carotene ', ' Lyc-O-Mato ', ' Calcium ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Measures ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Pan Species ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Chimp ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' cancer genome ', ' genetic variant ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' sharing data ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2009,3454975,0.4085035008100994
"Detection of Prostate Cancer Genomic Signatures in Blood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant application addresses the Broad Challenge Area ""03 - Biomarker Discovery and Validation"" as described within this FAO (RFA-OD-09-003) and the Specific Challenge Topic ""03-CA- 101 - Fingerprints for the early detection and treatment of cancer"". The diagnosis of prostate cancer (PC) is usually subsequent to routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) determination in blood and/or discovery of a palpable mass within the prostate (following rectal examination) that may be visualized by anatomic (US, CT) imaging. The nature of the primary masses is generally affirmed by histopathologic characterization following an invasive transrectal, ultrasound-directed, prostatic biopsy. At presentation, the majority of these tumors are localized in the prostate and surgical removal/radiation of these primary tumors can be curative. However, for many of the patients who develop metastases, despite current therapies, the outcome is death. A principal factor contributing to the high mortality rate is our inability to identify the presence of primary and metastatic occult PC lesions in men at the earliest/most curable stage, prior to the manifestation of pathologic signs and symptoms. While current blood-based assays (e.g., PSA) continue to play some role in diagnosis and in treatment monitoring, their specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy continue to be inadequate. We postulate that the false-positive and false-negative rates which have plagued this and other cancer assays are a consequence of their inadvertent dependence on population-derived, average genomic/ proteomic signature profiles that are obtained from the blood of ""healthy"" men, i.e., the baseline/ background signature(s) is/are NOT specific to the genetic makeup of the individual being tested. Recently, we proposed that phagocytic and nonphagocytic WBC - obtained from the same individual - are ideally suited to the facile identification and differentiation of ""tumor-specific"" and ""normal- specific"" signatures and, therefore, the elimination of the ""inequality of baseline"" consequent to the intrinsic interindividual (e.g., age, gender, ethnic background, health status) and temporal variation in gene expression. Uniquely, the approach does not depend on population-derived average signature profiles and/or biomarker values obtained from ""healthy"" controls. The approach claims that the analysis of DNA, RNA, protein, and/or lipid expression profiles of phagocytic WBCs and their comparison with those from nonphagocytic WBCs of the same donor will lead to the identification of tumor-specific signatures within the phagocytic cells (patient-specific signal) that are not expressed or minimally expressed in the nonphagocytic cells (patient-specific noise). Our preliminary studies in tumor-bearing mice and in a few cancer patients fully support our expectations and show that (i) multiple oncogenes and tumor-specific genomic signatures are selectively acquired/expressed within phagocytic cells; (ii) these genes are not expressed or are minimally expressed in nonphagocytic cells; and (iii) the assay - thus far in all instances - differentiates (a) tumor-bearing mice from non-tumor bearing mice, and (b) cancer patients from normal blood donors. In the studies proposed in this grant application, we plan to validate this unique approach in blood samples obtained from men known to have PC and demonstrate that the newly-developed novel blood assay (i) can differentiate between patients known to have PC and healthy individuals (blood donors), and (ii) will lead to the identification of genomic signatures that are specific to PC and are universally predictive of the presence of occult and/or recurring disease. We trust that our studies - upon successful verification of the blood assay in PC patients - will lead to the discovery of a gene array (spotted with the identified genomic signatures) that will (i) be used for the routine detection/diagnosis of PC, and (ii) be employed to identify disease recurrence. Consequently, we expect the blood test to have an unprecedentedly high impact on, and contribute significantly to, the goal of eradicating PC in the USA and worldwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE: The specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and/or accuracy of current blood-based cellular and molecular assays are inadequate. We postulate that the false-positive and false-negative rates that have plagued these assays are a consequence of their dependence on population-derived, average signature profiles obtained from the blood of ""healthy"" controls, i.e., the baseline/background signature(s) is/are NOT specific to the genetic makeup of the individual being tested. In this Challenge grant application, we describe methods for the identification of tumor-specific signatures within the WBCs of men known to have prostate cancer.               NARRATIVE  The specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and/or accuracy of current blood-based cellular and molecular assays are inadequate.

"Oxidative Stress, Antioxidants and Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This career development award will provide crucial training and experience in population genetics, bioinformatics, haplotyping, and tag SNP identification for Cathryn Bock, Ph.D. She is an Assistant Professor at Karmanos Cancer Institute and Wayne State University, proposing formal training and research under the mentorship of Ann Schwartz, Ph.D. and Rick Kittles, Ph.D., who have considerable expertise in these areas. In addition to attending relevant classes, seminars, and meetings, she will examine genes in the oxidative stress pathway, antioxidant intake and their potential interaction effects on racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence and progression in a sample of African American (AA) and European American men from metropolitan Detroit. Despite the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with prostate cancer, neither the etiology of the disease is not well characterized, nor are the large racial disparities. Oxidative stress has been proposed as one mechanism of prostate cancer initiation and progression, and early evidence supports this hypothesis. However, the specific role of genes in the oxidative stress pathway and their interactions with dietary and supplemental antioxidants are not yet well understood. Furthermore, it is possible that some of the racial differences in prostate cancer risk and progression may be explained by differences in genes involved in the oxidative stress pathway and their interaction with antioxidant intake. Therefore, this study will first estimate ancestry of the AA subjects using ancestry-informative markers from a previous study. Tag SNPs in three genes in the oxidative stress pathway, SOD2, OGG1, and GPX1 will then be identified. We will next assess whether variation in these genes modifies prostate cancer risk associated with intake of the antioxidants vitamin E, selenium and lycopene. Furthermore, each of these potential interactions will be examined by race and by prostate cancer aggressiveness to see if these oxidative stress pathway measures explain racial differences or disease progression. All analyses within the AA men will control for ancestry. DMA for analysis, interview, questionnaire, and medical record data will come from participants in an existing case-control study of prostate cancer in which enrollment recently was completed (PI: Benjamin A. Rybicki, Ph.D.). There are 275 AA men and 362 EA men with prostate cancer and 99 AA and 125 EA age- and race-matched men without prostate cancer enrolled in the case-control study with available data and blood samples and eligible for inclusion. This training is essential for Dr. Bock's transition to being an independent researcher in the genetic epidemiology of cancer.

"Determinants of Disparity in Prostate Cancer Outcomes    This Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) is being proposed to address significant gaps in our knowledge about factors that predict prostate cancer outcomes, and in particular the causes of disparity in prostate cancer outcomes between men of African and Caucasian descent. The mission of the proposed center is to 1) study the complex interaction of biological, clinical, behavioral, and environmental factors predictive of outcomes following a prostate cancer diagnosis, 2) evaluate how these factors explain disparities in prostate cancer outcomes by etnicity, and 3) disseminate this information to at-risk populations and the public health community. The CPHHD builds on our existing multidisciplinary research resources that include studies of the genetics, quality of life, patterns of care, physical environment, and social environment after the diagnosis of prostate cancer. This research requires transdisciplinary collaboration across molecular biology, genetic epidemiology, sociology, the behavioral sciences, and health policy. The proposed research has implications for clinical and public health practice, with potential to catalyze critical improvements in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. The CPHHD will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To undertake four highly interrelated research projects aimed at identifying factors that influence prostate cancer outcomes. These projects will evaluate the role of behavioral and environmental factors associated with physician and patient screening practices, screening behavior and genotypes on prostate cancer clinical outcomes, social and environmental factors on quality of life, and discrimination on treatment and medical outcomes after prostate cancer diagnoses. Specific Aim 2: To create three specialized cores to serve the needs of the CPHHD. These include: (1) an Administration Core to oversee and evaluate the CPHHD; (2) a Community Education and Dissemination Core to facilitate ongoing interactions with our community partners, and and to translate the information gained from this research to the public health community and general population; and (3) a Biomedical Informatics Core to provide integrated data management and to construct a comprehensive model of the multivariate biological, behavioral, social, and  environmental factors on prostate cancer outcomes. Specific Aim 3: To solicit and support a series of focused high priority developmental (pilot) research projects. These projects will be chosen to extend the primary research projects to additional studies of cancer screening, biological interactions, statistical model building for the integration of complex data from various disciplines. The goal of these developmental projects is to expand the scope of the research proposed in the four Projects described here and to enhance the multidisciplinary research team with members representing additional disciplines and expertise.

"Improving Patient Outcomes Through System Navigation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this application is to address a national priority in cancer control research by developing and conducting a highly innovative patient navigation program from the point of abnormal screening test to treatment for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. The major venue for this program of research will be the Denver Health Medical Center (DH), which is the single largest ""safety net"" health care system linked to a major metropolitan area in the Rocky Mountain Region. DH serves a large number of minority (75%) and underserved patients (almost half without insurance). Unique features of this research are: (1) testing for efficacy and cost-effectiveness a comprehensive patient navigator program that will extend an existing and exemplary community lay health worker demonstration project at DH (Community Voices); (2) combining this resource with a well-established telephone counseling service to specifically address patient-centered psychosocial barriers; and (3) integrating these components into a comprehensive patient navigator program within the context of the healthcare provider institution.   The following specific aims will guide the evaluation of this program: (1) to reduce the time between an abnormal screening test for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers to a positive or negative pathologic diagnosis; (2) to reduce the time from a positive pathologic diagnosis of breast, colorectal or prostate cancers to the start of therapy; (3) to increase the proportion of these patients adhering to recommendations for care, including completion of additional diagnostic tests, consultation appointments, and completion of treatment; (4) to improve patient reported outcomes of medical self-efficacy, satisfaction with care and distress related to cancer diagnosis in a sample of individuals with a negative pathologic diagnosis and among all individuals with a positive pathologic diagnosis; and (5) to examine the cost-effectiveness and return on investment of patient navigation. Ultimately we will demonstrate the efficacy and assess the financial impact associated with the implementation of a comprehensive navigation program designed to address disparities in cancer-related outcomes among the poor and underserved         ",Improving Patient Outcomes Through System Navigation,7940328,U01CA116903,"['improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Insurance ', ' Investments ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Appointment ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' programs ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Uninsured ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Navigation System ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' group intervention ', ' primary care setting ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' cancer initiation ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Consultations ', ' Control Groups ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Pathologic ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Goals ', ' ']",NCI,DENVER HEALTH AND HOSPITAL AUTHORITY,U01,2009,237685,0.13026754015250722
"Modeling US Prostate Cancer Trends: PSA, Treatment & Ra*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This study aims to determine the population impact of changing strategies for prostate cancer control, by linking trends in disease incidence and mortality with trends in screening and treatment.      The advent of PSA screening has transformed the way in which prostate cancer is detected and managed in the US.  Today, the majority of prostate cancers in this country are screen-detected and localized. Increasing numbers of newly-diagnosed cases are being treated with hormone suppression therapy (HT), which has traditionally been reserved for advanced tumors. Cause-specific survival among prostate cancer cases has increased dramatically, but the real increase in life expectancy during the PSA era remains unclear.      How have advances in screening and treatment contributed to prostate cancer death rates that have fallen by almost 30 percent since the early 1990s? And can racial disparities in patterns of care explain why mortality declines among African Americans are, only two-thirds of those among whites? We will use surveillance modeling to address these questions, building on our previous CISNET work, which modeled PSA screening. Our methods will combine simulation models and maximum likelihood analysis to address the following Specific Aims:   (1) Estimate the real improvement in life expectancy among prostate cancer cases during the PSA era;   (2) Quantify the contributions to mortality declines of PSA screening and HT, and evaluate whether the benefit of screening given growing use of HT exceeds the benefit that would be expected under standard therapies;   (3) Determine whether racial differences in PSA screening and HT can account for the different mortality declines experienced by whites and African Americans; and   (4) Address whether disease natural history differs according to race, by estimating lead times associated with PSA screening that are consistent with incidence trends in whites and African Americans.      Our models will require reliable estimates of trends in screening and treatment, which we will obtain using SEER-Medicare data, as well as patient claims data from a large HMO based in Northern California.      Through this work, our study promises to shed light on two of the most active controversies in prostate cancer research: the value of PSA screening versus advances in prostate cancer treatment, and the link between disparities in care and racial differences in prostate cancer outcomes.         ","Modeling US Prostate Cancer Trends: PSA, Treatment & Ra*",7680231,U01CA088160,"['Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Surveillance Modeling ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' CISNET ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Observational Study ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' trend ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Funding ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Mortality Decline ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Work ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' disease natural history ', ' California ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Accounting ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' PSA screening ', ' PSA test ', ' tumor ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,U01,2009,247885,0.3780711093835506
"Clark Atlanta University Biomedical Science Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical research at Clark Atlanta University (CAU) has been supported by the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)/National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Research Center in Minority Institutions (RCMI) program since 1985. The RCMI program at CAU over the last 20 years has been vital for the development of infrastructure for biomedical research by providing state-of-the-art equipment, recruitment of faculty and resources for individual researchers. The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) was created in 1999 with support from the RCMI program. CCRTD faculty belongs to the Departments of Biology, Chemistry and School of Education with research interests in cancer biology, drug discovery and behavioral aspects of cancer. During the current funding period, CCRTD decided to focus on the development of a nationally-recognized research program in prostate cancer. As a part of this initiative, CAU recruited three new faculty members with research programs focused on prostate cancer research and education.       The well-defined and focused activities at CCRTD have resulted in increased productivity and the stature of biomedical research at CAU. During the next funding period, we will continue to expand and enhance our research activities to achieve the goals of building a world class Center dedicated to research in prostate cancer and its impact in the African American community. The proposed specific goals are: 1) to develop and expand current research core facilities vital for carrying out research on the cellular and molecular biology of prostate cancer and 2) to recruit additional faculty who will further strengthen CCRTD. To provide additional support to CCRTD investigators, we propose to establish two new core units within CCRTD Research Support Core Facilities: Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core and Analytical Core. We also propose to recruit three additional faculty members who will be committed to high caliber research in prostate cancer biology and chemistry. Additional faculty is imperative to achieve a critical mass of scientists working in a collaborative and synergistic environment to create a world class center in prostate cancer research at CAU. This will be a unique Center of its kind at an HBCU.      Prostate cancer affects the African American community disproportionately. There is an increased incidence/mortality rate for African American men; however the reason for this is unknown. The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development is committed to focus on the impact of this health disparity within the African American community.          ",Clark Atlanta University Biomedical Science Development,7677461,G12RR003062,[''],NCRR,CLARK ATLANTA UNIVERSITY,G12,2009,1513670,0.2971993896395791
"Decision Making in Unaffected First-Degree Relatives of Prostate Cancer Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The use of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test in the general population and identifiable high-risk subgroups remains controversial, and the PSA test remains the only available test to date to detect early prostate cancer. Because of the controversy, many men who are likely to develop prostate cancer including African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer, remain uncertain about whether to take the PSA test or not to take the test; and often make these decisions without the benefit of an informed decision aid. Male first-degree relatives (FDRs) of prostate cancer patients (particularly brothers and sons) are known to be at increased risk for the disease, yet virtually no screening informed decision making aids have been developed specifically to help these men become informed about the disease and to decide about getting the PSA test or not getting the PSA test. The specific aims of this application are to (1) develop a targeted intervention to promote informed screening decision making for FDRs; (2) conduct a small pilot study to assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the ehanced decision aid. Our study design will involve two phases. The first phase of the study will involve focus groups and interviews with prostate cancer patients and their first-degree relatives (brothers and sons) to develop the content of a supplemental digital video disc (DVD) to accompany the existing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) decision making booklet. The supplemental DVD will include content developed specifically to address information needs and the multiple concurrent risk factors faced by FDRs. The second phase will be a single arm pilot study to test the new enhanced intervention (EI) consisting of CDC booklet plus new supplemental DVD. We will examine feasibility, acceptability, and how well the materials work (efficacy) in FDRs. The primary analysis will include examination of pre and post-intervention changes in knowledge, risk perception, screening decision made/intentions, decisional conflict (difficulty in decision making), satisfaction with decision, and intervention use. If successfully completed, the proposed project may lead to a future R01 application for a larger randomized, controlled intervention study to test the broad usefulness of the new decision aid (compared to standard materials) in promoting informed decision making. The ultimate goal of this line of research is to reduce prostate cancer disparities and disease burden.      Public Health Relevance: Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American men. The greatest burden of new cases and deaths from prostate cancer is experienced by African American men and men with a positive family history of the disease. Prostate cancer can be detected early with digital rectal exam (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test, yet the general use of PSA screening remains controversial and many men who are at high risk (e.g., men of African descent and men with a positive family history of prostate cancer) remain uncertain about whether to be tested or not. We seek to develop a decision aid (educational DVD) to help men with a positive family history of prostate cancer make informed decisions about testing, with the ultimate goal of reducing the burden of prostate cancer.          ",Decision Making in Unaffected First-Degree Relatives of Prostate Cancer Patients,7610906,R21CA125428,"['Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' First Degree Relative ', ' Process ', ' Intention ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' rectal ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Distress ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' post intervention ', ' African ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' satisfaction ', ' Sample Size ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Staging ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' Brothers ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Son ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Upper arm ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' videodisc ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' risk perception ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Comparative Study ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' neglect ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' comparative ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY SERVIC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) was established in 1999 at Clark Atlanta University to carry-out basic research in cancer biology and drug discovery. In 2004, the CCRTD decided to concentrate in the area of prostate cancer due to disproportionately higher incidence and mortality rate of this disease in African-American men. The current proposal requests support to establish a Center of Excellence in prostate cancer research, education and community education. The main objectives of this center will be 1) To carry out high quality basic research in cell and molecular biology of prostate cancer and to identify underlying biological reasons for racial disparities, 2) To establish a research training program for undergraduate and graduate students to provide research training in the area of prostate cancer and hence increase the number of minority (primarily African-American) scientists in this area of research, 3) To establish a community-based educational program for raising awareness on prevention, screening, early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. This goal will be achieved in collaboration with Clark Atlanta University Whitney M. Young, Jr. School of Social Work, Division of Communication Arts and Midtown Urology Educational Foundation. In the Research Core, we propose three research projects and 6 pilot projects focusing on prostate cancer cell and molecular biology and racial disparities. In the Training Core, we are requesting support for training of three graduate and 5 undergraduate students in the area of cancer biology and community service. In the Community Outreach/Education Core, we are requesting support to establish community events for free health screening for African-American men, for holding ""Town Hall"" educational meetings to be broadcast by the CAU-TV and radio stations, to develop public service announcements, and for hosting community events in conjunction with our annual national symposium on prostate cancer. The overall activities of the center will be monitored by the Administrative Core. The activities of the Administrative Core will be overseen by the Institutional (IAC), External (EAC) and Local External (LEAC) Advisory Committees. The long term goals of the center will be to understand the biology of prostate cancer, to increase the number of African-American scientists in cancer research, and to educate the African-American community in the areas of prostate cancer prevention, early detection and treatment.              ","CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY SERVIC",7645123,P20MD002285,[''],NIMHD,CLARK ATLANTA UNIVERSITY,P20,2009,1734890,0.3356848690564944

"EphB2 as a Prostate Cancer tumor Suppressor and Risk Factor in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in African American men. Incidence and mortality rates are disproportionately higher among African American men when compared to Caucasian men in the US. The specific factors influencing this disparity remain poorly understood. Although dietary and environmental exposures are among the culprits, evidence exist, which support a role for genetic factors. Candidate gene studies have implicated several genes as being associated with increased prostate cancer risk among African American men. One interesting candidate gene encodes the EphB2 tyrosine kinase gene. The PI and colleagues were the first to report somatic mutations and loss of function of EphB2 in sporadic prostate cancer. Furthermore, we have recently published an association between EphB2 and prostate cancer risk in African Americans. Specifically, we have demonstrated that a common germline nonsense variant in EphB2 confers a three-fold increase in risk in African American men with a positive family history of prostate cancer. Furthermore, this nonsense variant is in admixture disequilibrium in African Americans. Taken together, these and existing data implicating EphB2 in prostate cancer warrant continued investigation. Our central hypothesis is that EphB2 is a genetic risk factor and tumor suppressor gene associated with prostate cancer in African American men. Specifically, we hypothesize that common variants in EphB2 are associated with prostate cancer risk in AA men and that this locus is associated with genomic loss in tumors from AA prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, we hypothesize that a common nonsense variant associated with risk (K1019X) confers a negative functional consequence on the EphB2 protein. To test our hypothesis we are proposing the following specific aims: 1. To test the association between PC risk and germline variants in the EphB2 gene in unselected AA PC cases and controls. 2. To evaluate loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the EphB2 locus in PC tumors from familial and sporadic AA cases. 3. To perform in vitro functional analysis of the K1019X mutation by introducing a mutated EphB2 construct into EphB2 null DU145 PC cells.

"Pten-loss Dysregulated Pathways in Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths (after lung cancer) in American men, and the morbidity and the mortality to PCa are even higher in African American men as compared Caucasians. Molecular mechanisms leading to the initiation and progression of PCa including castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or androgen insensitive prostate cancer (AI-PC) are poorly understood. PTEN and p53 are the two most frequently deleted and/ or mutated genes in a variety of human cancers including advanced PCa. Loss of PTEN leads to the hyperactivation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) and serine/Thr kinase (Akt/PKB). Pten-deficient mice develop high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and invasive adenocarcinoma. We have recently demonstrated in our mouse model that the acute inactivation of Pten unexpectedly elicits cellular senescence, a novel mechanism suppressing cancer progression. Aberrant regulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors including p19Arf, p53 and p21 proteins have been observed in prostate tumors of Pten-deficient mice. We hypothesize that aberrant activation of p19Arf-p53 pathways cooperates with Pten loss to result in prostate cancer progression. We propose to test this hypothesis and to study the molecular mechanisms of regulating Pten-p19Arf-p53 network in prostate cancer using mouse models and cell lines with following Specific Aims: 1) To define the role of p19Arf in prostate cancer progression. 2) To determine the functional roles of p19Arf in the crosstalk of Pten and p53 during tumorigenesis. 3) To address the consequence and relevance of p19Arf inactivation in CRPC growth using Pten/p53 mouse model. Results obtained from this award will provide us valuable insights into novel roles of ARF in prostate cancer progression.               Project Narrative The goal of this project is to elucidate Pten-loss dysregulated pathways in prostate cancer (PCa) by defining novel roles of p19Arf in prostate cancer progression including castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) growth. Results will provide significant insights into understanding of mechanisms on the incidence and the mortality of PCa, and disparities among ethnic and racial groups.",Pten-loss Dysregulated Pathways in Prostate Cancer,7807816,R01MD004038,"['Mutate ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Genes ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Acute ', ' Refractory ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' Link ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' insight ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mutant Strains Mice ', ' mouse mutant ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Morbidity -

"Prostate cancer health literacy in rural versus urban African-American men.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed noncutaneous cancer in United States men and the second leading cause of cancer death. It is estimated that 186,320 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008 and 28,660 men will die of it. Prostate cancer disproportionately affects African American men, who have a 1.7 fold greater incidence and a 2.4 fold greater mortality than white men. As a result, prostate cancer is an important source of health disparities. We will use the Ottawa Decision Support Framework (ODSF) from the field of shared decision making to examine prostate cancer health literacy among African American men from two clinics caring for large underserved populations. Values clarification and risk communication are central to the process of prostate cancer screening decisions because screening has not been shown to decrease cancer mortality but the side effects of treatment are prevalent and long term. It is critical for physicians and patients to be able to accurately discuss the impotence, incontinence, and bowel symptoms that often result from treatment, so patients can decide whether to be screened for prostate cancer. In preliminary studies, we reviewed patient education materials to identify six specific domains of prostate cancer health literacy. These domains include the skills that patients need to learn new information and the knowledge that patients are assumed to have at baseline. In preliminary structured interviews among African American men in two low-income clinics, we showed that many patients did not have the health literacy skills or knowledge that consumers are assumed to possess. Consequently, we hypothesize that patients are unlikely to learn enough about prostate cancer from standard materials provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to participate in shared decision making as currently recommended by most health agencies. We have established a collaboration with the NCI's Cancer Information Service, Howard University, and the Tug River Health Association in rural West Virginia to explore this hypothesis. Using structured interviews, we will characterize understanding of CDC and NCI prostate cancer decision guides with a focus on numerical and graphical risk communication among men with poor reading skills. We will link our study to other work in the field using recently developed numeracy scales to relate mathematical skills and reading skills to how patients understand the uncertainties of the screening decision. We will use qualitative methods and conceptual metaphor to explore ways to improve communication and shared decisions for African American men with low literacy skills. Results will be used to revise prostate cancer education materials to be more accessible to men with low literacy skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer mortality is an important source of health disparities among African American men. In preliminary studies, we have identified barriers to prostate cancer health literacy among African American men recruited from two rural, low-income clinics. We will use qualitative methods to identify techniques to overcome these barriers and compare any differences between rural and urban African American men.           7.

"Expanding resources for understanding the genetic basis for prostate cancer in Af    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant): Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among men. At the moment, we do not understand the underlying etiology, or why different groups, such as African Americans, have higher rates of disease. Risk factors for prostate cancer have remained elusive and aside from age, having a family history of the disease or African ancestry, until recently, no genetic or non-genetic (i.e., lifestyle) risk factors have been consistently demonstrated to contribute to variation in disease risk in the population. In this application, we propose to undertake a large-scale collaborative effort to uncover genetic predictors of prostate cancer in African American men. For this effort, we have assembled a multi-institutional team of investigators with experience in prostate cancer research in minority populations who are eager and willing to pool resources, specimens and data from their established studies, and to work closely together towards a common goal. To identify genetic factors that contribute to prostate cancer risk in African American men we propose to conduct a well-powered multi-stage genome-wide association study. We currently have funding (U01-NCI) to genotype 1,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2,500 African American prostate cancer cases and 2,500 controls. We now propose to expand the size of stage 1 to 4,086 cases and 4,145 controls. In stage 2 we will perform follow-up genotyping of 1,500 SNPs that demonstrate significant main effects and interactions with known risk variants for prostate cancer (e.g. 8q24) in an additional 1,044 African American cases and 1,083 controls. In this study we will also assess the pan-ethnic effects of the variants identified in the African American scan, by replication testing in 600 prostate cancer cases and 1,050 controls from West Africa. In this dataset, we will also examine interactions between associated variants, environmental factors (thereby better defining the role of these factors) and disease severity. We expect this work to significantly advance knowledge of the etiology of prostate cancer and racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer risk, and to guide the development of future preventive, early detection, prognostic and even therapeutic measures.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to identify common risk alleles for prostate cancer in African American men.

In stage 1 we will genotype 1,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,500 African American prostate cancer cases and 1,500 controls. In stage 2 we will perform follow-up genotyping of 24,000 SNPs that demonstrate significant main effects and interactions with known risk variants for prostate cancer (e.g. 8q24) in an additional 1,626 African American cases and 1,867 controls. In stage 3, we will further examine genetic associations from stage 1+2 in an additional 1,124 African American cases and 1,163 controls. In this study we will also assess the pan-ethnic effects of the variants identify in the African American scan, by replication testing in 3,900 prostate cancer cases and 4,350 controls of West African, Japanese, Latino and European American ancestry. In this dataset, we will also examine interactions between associated variants, environmental factors (thereby better defining the role of these factors) and disease severity. We expect this work to significantly advance knowledge of the etiology of prostate cancer and racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer risk, and to guide the development of future preventive, early detection, prognostic and even therapeutic measures. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to identify common risk alleles for prostate cancer in African American men. For this effort, we have assembled a multi-institutional team of investigators with experience in prostate cancer research in minority populations who are eager and willing to pool resources, specimens and data from their established studies, and to work closely together towards a common goal. More specifically, we propose to conduct a multi-stage genome-wide association study of prostate cancer, which will include 4,250 African American cases and 4,530 African American male controls. We will examine the pan-ethnic effects of associated variants in other racial/ethnic populations as well as incorporate environment and lifestyle risk factors in association testing to assist in better defining the subgroups of the African American population at greatest risk of developing this common cancer.

"Quality of Life in Prostate Cancer Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death, with consistent outcome disparities between African Americans (AA) and Caucasian Americans (CA).  Many studies have reported the various factors associated with racial differences in prostate cancer incidence and mortality between AA and CA. Little is known about the racial differences in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) between AA and CA, especially the pre-diagnosis lifestyle (healthy behaviors) factors, socioeconomic (SES) factors and healthcare seeking   behaviors and beliefs associated with the differences of HRQOL. Our primary hypothesis is that   racial differences in long-term prostate cancer HRQOL are the results of racial differences in healthy behaviors prior to diagnosis, SES and healthcare seeking behaviors and beliefs. A population-based prospective study, the Quality of Life Prostate Cancer Project (Q-PCaP), is proposed to address this issue. Q-PCaP is a follow-up study built upon the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP), which was a population-based study conducted from July 2004 through August 2009 for the Louisiana part. Q-PCaP will collect follow up HRQOL data among the Louisiana cohort of PCaP and conduct secondary analysis of the PCaP baseline data set. All analyses will control for disease aggressiveness at initial diagnosis and primary treatment methods. Q-PCaP is designed to evaluate factors contributing to disparities in prostate cancer, particularly prostate cancer HRQOL in order to facilitate efforts to decrease disparities and enhance HRQOL in prostate cancer survivors.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HRQoL and HBL are potentially modifiable factors that may contribute to racial differences in PCa outcomes; however, these factors have not been directly evaluated as mediators of racial disparities.

"Clark Atlanta University Biomedical Science Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical research at Clark Atlanta University (CAU) has been supported by the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)/National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Research Center in Minority Institutions (RCMI) program since 1985. The RCMI program at CAU over the last 20 years has been vital for the development of infrastructure for biomedical research by providing state-of-the-art equipment, recruitment of faculty and resources for individual researchers. The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) was created in 1999 with support from the RCMI program. CCRTD faculty belongs to the Departments of Biology, Chemistry and School of Education with research interests in cancer biology, drug discovery and behavioral aspects of cancer. During the current funding period, CCRTD decided to focus on the development of a nationally-recognized research program in prostate cancer. As a part of this initiative, CAU recruited three new faculty members with research programs focused on prostate cancer research and education.       The well-defined and focused activities at CCRTD have resulted in increased productivity and the stature of biomedical research at CAU. During the next funding period, we will continue to expand and enhance our research activities to achieve the goals of building a world class Center dedicated to research in prostate cancer and its impact in the African American community. The proposed specific goals are: 1) to develop and expand current research core facilities vital for carrying out research on the cellular and molecular biology of prostate cancer and 2) to recruit additional faculty who will further strengthen CCRTD. To provide additional support to CCRTD investigators, we propose to establish two new core units within CCRTD Research Support Core Facilities: Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core and Analytical Core. We also propose to recruit three additional faculty members who will be committed to high caliber research in prostate cancer biology and chemistry. Additional faculty is imperative to achieve a critical mass of scientists working in a collaborative and synergistic environment to create a world class center in prostate cancer research at CAU. This will be a unique Center of its kind at an HBCU.      Prostate cancer affects the African American community disproportionately. There is an increased incidence/mortality rate for African American men; however the reason for this is unknown.

"Oxidative Stress, Antioxidants and Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This career development award will provide crucial training and experience in population genetics, bioinformatics, haplotyping, and tag SNP identification for Cathryn Bock, Ph.D. She is an Assistant Professor at Karmanos Cancer Institute and Wayne State University, proposing formal training and research under the mentorship of Ann Schwartz, Ph.D. and Rick Kittles, Ph.D., who have considerable expertise in these areas. In addition to attending relevant classes, seminars, and meetings, she will examine genes in the oxidative stress pathway, antioxidant intake and their potential interaction effects on racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence and progression in a sample of African American (AA) and European American men from metropolitan Detroit. Despite the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with prostate cancer, neither the etiology of the disease is not well characterized, nor are the large racial disparities. Oxidative stress has been proposed as one mechanism of prostate cancer initiation and progression, and early evidence supports this hypothesis. However, the specific role of genes in the oxidative stress pathway and their interactions with dietary and supplemental antioxidants are not yet well understood. Furthermore, it is possible that some of the racial differences in prostate cancer risk and progression may be explained by differences in genes involved in the oxidative stress pathway and their interaction with antioxidant intake. Therefore, this study will first estimate ancestry of the AA subjects using ancestry-informative markers from a previous study. Tag SNPs in three genes in the oxidative stress pathway, SOD2, OGG1, and GPX1 will then be identified. We will next assess whether variation in these genes modifies prostate cancer risk associated with intake of the antioxidants vitamin E, selenium and lycopene. Furthermore, each of these potential interactions will be examined by race and by prostate cancer aggressiveness to see if these oxidative stress pathway measures explain racial differences or disease progression. All analyses within the AA men will control for ancestry. DMA for analysis, interview, questionnaire, and medical record data will come from participants in an existing case-control study of prostate cancer in which enrollment recently was completed (PI: Benjamin A. Rybicki, Ph.D.). There are 275 AA men and 362 EA men with prostate cancer and 99 AA and 125 EA age- and race-matched men without prostate cancer enrolled in the case-control study with available data and blood samples and eligible for inclusion. This training is essential for Dr. Bock's transition to being an independent researcher in the genetic epidemiology of cancer. The identification of genetic markers for prostate cancer risk and progression, and of racial differences in the interaction of these markers with intake of antioxidants will improve screening techniques and prevention targeting efforts.          ","Oxidative Stress, Antioxidants and Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer",7918787,K07CA119109,"['Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Selenium ', ' Se element ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Superoxide Dismutase ', ' cytocuprein ', ' Hemocuprein ', ' Erythrocuprein ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Vitamin E ', ' Techniques ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' professor ', ' metropolitan ', ' lycopene ', ' psi,psi-carotene ', ' Lyc-O-Mato ', ' Participant ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' Population ', ' cancer initiation ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' OGG1 gene ', ' OGH1 Gene ', ' OGG1 ', ' N-Glycosylase/DNA Lyase Gene ', ' MUTM Gene ', ' MMH Gene ', ' SOD2 gene ', ' SOD2 ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Intake ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Gene-Modified ', ' Oxidative Stress Pathway ', ' Oxidative Stress Induced Gene Expression Via Nrf2 ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Age ', ' glutathione peroxidase ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Medical Records ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentorship ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Questionnaires ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,K07,2010,132921,0.3131696686278995
"Pten-loss Dysregulated Pathways in Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths (after lung cancer) in American men, and the morbidity and the mortality to PCa are even higher in African American men as compared Caucasians. Molecular mechanisms leading to the initiation and progression of PCa including castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or androgen insensitive prostate cancer (AI-PC) are poorly understood. PTEN and p53 are the two most frequently deleted and/ or mutated genes in a variety of human cancers including advanced PCa. Loss of PTEN leads to the hyperactivation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) and serine/Thr kinase (Akt/PKB). Pten-deficient mice develop high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and invasive adenocarcinoma. We have recently demonstrated in our mouse model that the acute inactivation of Pten unexpectedly elicits cellular senescence, a novel mechanism suppressing cancer progression. Aberrant regulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors including p19Arf, p53 and p21 proteins have been observed in prostate tumors of Pten-deficient mice. We hypothesize that aberrant activation of p19Arf-p53 pathways cooperates with Pten loss to result in prostate cancer progression. We propose to test this hypothesis and to study the molecular mechanisms of regulating Pten-p19Arf-p53 network in prostate cancer using mouse models and cell lines with following Specific Aims: 1) To define the role of p19Arf in prostate cancer progression. 2) To determine the functional roles of p19Arf in the crosstalk of Pten and p53 during tumorigenesis. 3) To address the consequence and relevance of p19Arf inactivation in CRPC growth using Pten/p53 mouse model.

"Expanding resources for understanding the genetic basis for prostate cancer in Af    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant): Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among men. At the moment, we do not understand the underlying etiology, or why different groups, such as African Americans, have higher rates of disease. Risk factors for prostate cancer have remained elusive and aside from age, having a family history of the disease or African ancestry, until recently, no genetic or non-genetic (i.e., lifestyle) risk factors have been consistently demonstrated to contribute to variation in disease risk in the population. In this application, we propose to undertake a large-scale collaborative effort to uncover genetic predictors of prostate cancer in African American men. For this effort, we have assembled a multi-institutional team of investigators with experience in prostate cancer research in minority populations who are eager and willing to pool resources, specimens and data from their established studies, and to work closely together towards a common goal. To identify genetic factors that contribute to prostate cancer risk in African American men we propose to conduct a well-powered multi-stage genome-wide association study. We currently have funding (U01-NCI) to genotype 1,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2,500 African American prostate cancer cases and 2,500 controls. We now propose to expand the size of stage 1 to 4,086 cases and 4,145 controls. In stage 2 we will perform follow-up genotyping of 1,500 SNPs that demonstrate significant main effects and interactions with known risk variants for prostate cancer (e.g. 8q24) in an additional 1,044 African American cases and 1,083 controls. In this study we will also assess the pan-ethnic effects of the variants identified in the African American scan, by replication testing in 600 prostate cancer cases and 1,050 controls from West Africa. In this dataset, we will also examine interactions between associated variants, environmental factors (thereby better defining the role of these factors) and disease severity. We expect this work to significantly advance knowledge of the etiology of prostate cancer and racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer risk, and to guide the development of future preventive, early detection, prognostic and even therapeutic measures.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to identify common risk alleles for prostate cancer in African American men. For this effort, we have assembled a multi-institutional team of investigators with experience in prostate cancer research in minority populations who are eager and willing to pool resources, specimens and data from their established studies, and to work closely together towards a common goal. More specifically, we propose to conduct a multi-stage genome-wide association study of prostate cancer, which will include >5,500 African American cases and >5,100 African American male controls, to better define the subgroups of the African American population at greatest risk of developing this common cancer.           Project Narrative The goal of this project is to identify common risk alleles for prostate cancer in African American men.

"Assessing Localized Prostate Cancer Post-Treatment Outcomes Among Gay Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite including sexual orientation as a source of disparity in Healthy People 2010, public health research on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations has been lacking for the past 20 years, especially research that is not related to sexually transmitted diseases. This is of concern in prostate cancer treatment, with its manifold impacts on male quality of life. The very substantial body of research on the complex physical and psychosocial outcomes of treatment has traditionally assumed a heterosexual frame of reference. This is problematic when patient centered measures attempt to assess important changes in physical function associated with treatment. It is especially limiting when attention turns, as it has in recent years, to how changes in sexual function, which affect the majority of men who pursue active treatment, are appreciated in terms of how they affect the emotional and social well-being of men. All men are at risk of prostate cancer regardless of sexual orientation, but the experiences of gay men are unknown. Gay men may have difficulty dealing with heterosexually oriented urologists and oncologists, which may undermine the supportive dialog that facilitates satisfying treatment decisions and outcomes. To ensure the successful recruitment of gay men, many of whom are reluctant to self-identify as such in a traditional clinical setting, a variety of recruitment approaches will be used. Thus, this study will: (1) revise recently developed measures of physical and psychosocial domains of prostate cancer-related quality of life to better assess the experiences of gay men; and (2) assess post-treatment prostate cancer quality of life outcomes among gay men. These findings will inform the development of a quality of life model that takes into account the role of sexual orientation in prostate cancer treatment outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This study will continue a line of research developing a biopsychosocial model of the outcomes of treatment for prostate cancer that began with studies conducted by Talcott, Clark and their colleagues, along with many others. While these studies have shown that sexual and other bodily changes ramify broadly following prostate cancer treatment, our appreciation of these effects has been severely limited by sampling only heterosexual men. The proposed study seeks to remedy this deficit and develop a more comprehensive model of quality of life, based on inclusion of gay men, that can help inform clinicians performing prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment of quality of life outcomes that may be unique to gay men with localized prostate cancer.           This study will continue a line of research developing a biopsychosocial model of the outcomes of treatment for prostate cancer that began with studies conducted by Talcott, Clark and their colleagues, along with many others.

"Community-Based Research to Improve Prostate Cancer Patient Treatment Decisions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians recognize the need for and support informed decision making as a mechanism for helping men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer and are considering treatment. Men need help to reduce decisional regret, reduce decisional conflict, improve satisfaction with their treatment decisions and develop a plan for coping with the sequelae of quality-of-life compromising side effects. A variety of factors interact at multiple socio-ecologic levels to facilitate or prevent informed decision making from occurring. The manner in which culture influences prostate cancer treatment decision-making among African Americans remains understudied. Research from other health contexts strongly suggests that participatory action research can be helpful in generating new culturally appropriate knowledge to apply to this problem. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that interventions developed using participatory research approaches are effective for improving informed treatment decision making for prostate cancer with African-American men. The purpose of the current Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) grant application is to provide the applicant, a newly appointed assistant professor of oncology at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI), with appropriate training and research experience that will enable him to function as an independent investigator building a research program in disparities and prostate cancer. Support provided by this training grant will provide Dr. Ross with sufficient release time (75%) to complete a career development plan that consists of carefully selected didactic coursework, individualized instruction, seminars, and research experiences grounded in applied ethnographic and community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. The aims of Dr. Ross' proposed research are (1) to formalize and strengthen a community-research partnership between a group of prostate cancer advocates and the Office of Cancer Health Disparities Research at Roswell Park Cancer Institute that will guide community driven cancer educational initiatives; (2) to conduct ethnographic research with African-American men and their significant others to provide a holistic, contextualized description of their experiences with prostate cancer treatment; and (3) to use a participatory research approach to create a culturally appropriate treatment decision-making intervention for African- American men and their significant others. The proposed training and experience in ethnography and CBPR will yield rich insights into prostate cancer education for hard-to-reach, high risk populations. It will also contribute vital information to the fields of health education and behavior to enhance cancer control.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public health and medical professionals struggle with helping African-American men make informed choices for prostate cancer treatment.

"Detection of Prostate Cancer Genomic Signatures in Blood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant application addresses the Broad Challenge Area ""03 - Biomarker Discovery and Validation"" as described within this FAO (RFA-OD-09-003) and the Specific Challenge Topic ""03-CA- 101 - Fingerprints for the early detection and treatment of cancer"". The diagnosis of prostate cancer (PC) is usually subsequent to routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) determination in blood and/or discovery of a palpable mass within the prostate (following rectal examination) that may be visualized by anatomic (US, CT) imaging. The nature of the primary masses is generally affirmed by histopathologic characterization following an invasive transrectal, ultrasound-directed, prostatic biopsy. At presentation, the majority of these tumors are localized in the prostate and surgical removal/radiation of these primary tumors can be curative. However, for many of the patients who develop metastases, despite current therapies, the outcome is death. A principal factor contributing to the high mortality rate is our inability to identify the presence of primary and metastatic occult PC lesions in men at the earliest/most curable stage, prior to the manifestation of pathologic signs and symptoms. While current blood-based assays (e.g., PSA) continue to play some role in diagnosis and in treatment monitoring, their specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy continue to be inadequate. We postulate that the false-positive and false-negative rates which have plagued this and other cancer assays are a consequence of their inadvertent dependence on population-derived, average genomic/ proteomic signature profiles that are obtained from the blood of ""healthy"" men, i.e., the baseline/ background signature(s) is/are NOT specific to the genetic makeup of the individual being tested. Recently, we proposed that phagocytic and nonphagocytic WBC - obtained from the same individual - are ideally suited to the facile identification and differentiation of ""tumor-specific"" and ""normal- specific"" signatures and, therefore, the elimination of the ""inequality of baseline"" consequent to the intrinsic interindividual (e.g., age, gender, ethnic background, health status) and temporal variation in gene expression. Uniquely, the approach does not depend on population-derived average signature profiles and/or biomarker values obtained from ""healthy"" controls. The approach claims that the analysis of DNA, RNA, protein, and/or lipid expression profiles of phagocytic WBCs and their comparison with those from nonphagocytic WBCs of the same donor will lead to the identification of tumor-specific signatures within the phagocytic cells (patient-specific signal) that are not expressed or minimally expressed in the nonphagocytic cells (patient-specific noise). Our preliminary studies in tumor-bearing mice and in a few cancer patients fully support our expectations and show that (i) multiple oncogenes and tumor-specific genomic signatures are selectively acquired/expressed within phagocytic cells; (ii) these genes are not expressed or are minimally expressed in nonphagocytic cells; and (iii) the assay - thus far in all instances - differentiates (a) tumor-bearing mice from non-tumor bearing mice, and (b) cancer patients from normal blood donors. In the studies proposed in this grant application, we plan to validate this unique approach in blood samples obtained from men known to have PC and demonstrate that the newly-developed novel blood assay (i) can differentiate between patients known to have PC and healthy individuals (blood donors), and (ii) will lead to the identification of genomic signatures that are specific to PC and are universally predictive of the presence of occult and/or recurring disease. We trust that our studies - upon successful verification of the blood assay in PC patients - will lead to the discovery of a gene array (spotted with the identified genomic signatures) that will (i) be used for the routine detection/diagnosis of PC, and (ii) be employed to identify disease recurrence. Consequently, we expect the blood test to have an unprecedentedly high impact on, and contribute significantly to, the goal of eradicating PC in the USA and worldwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE: The specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and/or accuracy of current blood-based cellular and molecular assays are inadequate. We postulate that the false-positive and false-negative rates that have plagued these assays are a consequence of their dependence on population-derived, average signature profiles obtained from the blood of ""healthy"" controls, i.e., the baseline/background signature(s) is/are NOT specific to the genetic makeup of the individual being tested.

"The Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the prostate cancer (CaP) incidence rates in the overall US population has declined in recent years, mortality from CaP is two to three times greater among African American men (AAM) compared to White men. To date the disparate incidence of CaP in AAM in the US compared to their Caucasian counterparts is poorly understood. Of further concern is the growing literature on the burden of CaP among other Black men in the Caribbean, the United Kingdom and West Africa. Although African men may share a common genetic risk locus contributing to the higher incidence of CaP, the etiology of the variability in risk observed even among African men living in varying environments and cultures highlights the strong and evolving knowledge of the contribution of behavioral factors that may modify these biological risk factors. Our preliminary observations and that of others point to the fact that it is important for us to study the behavioral, environmental and genetic determinants of CaP among Black men using common methodologies and uniform instruments. Global collaborations among CaP scientists, clinicians and advocates are thus important to understand the etiology of CaP among at-risk Black men, and develop effective interventions to address CaP disparities. A Biennial conference on ""The Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men"" is proposed to: (1) Promote trans-disciplinary CaP research globally; (2) Provide opportunities for mutual learning, knowledge transfer, and collaborations among scientists, clinicians and advocates; (3) Facilitate networking among individuals involved in all aspects of CaP control and research in Black men; and (4) Facilitate the development of a global community of practice to address common challenges in CaP disparities research. The conference will lead to the enhancement of the quantity and quality of the scientific knowledge on the etiology and risk factors for CaP in Black men, a giant step to ultimately eliminate the CaP disparities experienced by this group. Our proposed conference has the potential to bring to the fore new understanding of a disease of major public health significance.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Biennial conference on ""The Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men"" is proposed to facilitate the understanding and elimination of the prostate health disparity among Black men of African ancestry through transdiciplinary collaborations among prostate cancer scientists, clinicians and advocates worldwide.           A Biennial conference on ""The Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men"" is proposed to facilitate the understanding and elimination of the prostate health disparity among Black men of African ancestry through transdiciplinary collaborations among prostate cancer scientists, clinicians and advocates worldwide.",The Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men Conference,7806149,R13CA144439,"['Africa ', ' Biological ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' Caucasians ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Community Practice ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R13,2010,20000,0.24827483666545927
"Improving Patient Outcomes Through System Navigation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this application is to address a national priority in cancer control research by developing and conducting a highly innovative patient navigation program from the point of abnormal screening test to treatment for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. The major venue for this program of research will be the Denver Health Medical Center (DH), which is the single largest ""safety net"" health care system linked to a major metropolitan area in the Rocky Mountain Region. DH serves a large number of minority (75%) and underserved patients (almost half without insurance).

"Prostate cancer health literacy in rural versus urban African-American men.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed noncutaneous cancer in United States men and the second leading cause of cancer death. It is estimated that 186,320 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008 and 28,660 men will die of it. Prostate cancer disproportionately affects African American men, who have a 1.7 fold greater incidence and a 2.4 fold greater mortality than white men. As a result, prostate cancer is an important source of health disparities. We will use the Ottawa Decision Support Framework (ODSF) from the field of shared decision making to examine prostate cancer health literacy among African American men from two clinics caring for large underserved populations. Values clarification and risk communication are central to the process of prostate cancer screening decisions because screening has not been shown to decrease cancer mortality but the side effects of treatment are prevalent and long term. It is critical for physicians and patients to be able to accurately discuss the impotence, incontinence, and bowel symptoms that often result from treatment, so patients can decide whether to be screened for prostate cancer. In preliminary studies, we reviewed patient education materials to identify six specific domains of prostate cancer health literacy. These domains include the skills that patients need to learn new information and the knowledge that patients are assumed to have at baseline. In preliminary structured interviews among African American men in two low-income clinics, we showed that many patients did not have the health literacy skills or knowledge that consumers are assumed to possess. Consequently, we hypothesize that patients are unlikely to learn enough about prostate cancer from standard materials provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to participate in shared decision making as currently recommended by most health agencies. We have established a collaboration with the NCI's Cancer Information Service, Howard University, and the Tug River Health Association in rural West Virginia to explore this hypothesis. Using structured interviews, we will characterize understanding of CDC and NCI prostate cancer decision guides with a focus on numerical and graphical risk communication among men with poor reading skills. We will link our study to other work in the field using recently developed numeracy scales to relate mathematical skills and reading skills to how patients understand the uncertainties of the screening decision. We will use qualitative methods and conceptual metaphor to explore ways to improve communication and shared decisions for African American men with low literacy skills. Results will be used to revise prostate cancer education materials to be more accessible to men with low literacy skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer mortality is an important source of health disparities among African American men. In preliminary studies, we have identified barriers to prostate cancer health literacy among African American men recruited from two rural, low-income clinics. We will use qualitative methods to identify techniques to overcome these barriers and compare any differences between rural and urban African American men.           7.

"Clark Atlanta University Biomedical Science Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical research at Clark Atlanta University (CAU) has been supported by the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)/National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Research Center in Minority Institutions (RCMI) program since 1985. The RCMI program at CAU over the last 20 years has been vital for the development of infrastructure for biomedical research by providing state-of-the-art equipment, recruitment of faculty and resources for individual researchers. The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) was created in 1999 with support from the RCMI program. CCRTD faculty belongs to the Departments of Biology, Chemistry and School of Education with research interests in cancer biology, drug discovery and behavioral aspects of cancer. During the current funding period, CCRTD decided to focus on the development of a nationally-recognized research program in prostate cancer. As a part of this initiative, CAU recruited three new faculty members with research programs focused on prostate cancer research and education.       The well-defined and focused activities at CCRTD have resulted in increased productivity and the stature of biomedical research at CAU. During the next funding period, we will continue to expand and enhance our research activities to achieve the goals of building a world class Center dedicated to research in prostate cancer and its impact in the African American community. The proposed specific goals are: 1) to develop and expand current research core facilities vital for carrying out research on the cellular and molecular biology of prostate cancer and 2) to recruit additional faculty who will further strengthen CCRTD. To provide additional support to CCRTD investigators, we propose to establish two new core units within CCRTD Research Support Core Facilities: Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core and Analytical Core. We also propose to recruit three additional faculty members who will be committed to high caliber research in prostate cancer biology and chemistry. Additional faculty is imperative to achieve a critical mass of scientists working in a collaborative and synergistic environment to create a world class center in prostate cancer research at CAU. This will be a unique Center of its kind at an HBCU.      Prostate cancer affects the African American community disproportionately.

"Community-Based Research to Improve Prostate Cancer Patient Treatment Decisions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians recognize the need for and support informed decision making as a mechanism for helping men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer and are considering treatment. Men need help to reduce decisional regret, reduce decisional conflict, improve satisfaction with their treatment decisions and develop a plan for coping with the sequelae of quality-of-life compromising side effects. A variety of factors interact at multiple socio-ecologic levels to facilitate or prevent informed decision making from occurring. The manner in which culture influences prostate cancer treatment decision-making among African Americans remains understudied. Research from other health contexts strongly suggests that participatory action research can be helpful in generating new culturally appropriate knowledge to apply to this problem. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that interventions developed using participatory research approaches are effective for improving informed treatment decision making for prostate cancer with African-American men. The purpose of the current Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) grant application is to provide the applicant, a newly appointed assistant professor of oncology at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI), with appropriate training and research experience that will enable him to function as an independent investigator building a research program in disparities and prostate cancer. Support provided by this training grant will provide Dr. Ross with sufficient release time (75%) to complete a career development plan that consists of carefully selected didactic coursework, individualized instruction, seminars, and research experiences grounded in applied ethnographic and community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. The aims of Dr. Ross' proposed research are (1) to formalize and strengthen a community-research partnership between a group of prostate cancer advocates and the Office of Cancer Health Disparities Research at Roswell Park Cancer Institute that will guide community driven cancer educational initiatives; (2) to conduct ethnographic research with African-American men and their significant others to provide a holistic, contextualized description of their experiences with prostate cancer treatment; and (3) to use a participatory research approach to create a culturally appropriate treatment decision-making intervention for African- American men and their significant others. The proposed training and experience in ethnography and CBPR will yield rich insights into prostate cancer education for hard-to-reach, high risk populations. It will also contribute vital information to the fields of health education and behavior to enhance cancer control.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public health and medical professionals struggle with helping African-American men make informed choices for prostate cancer treatment.

"A Network Analytic Approach to Modeling Variation in Prostate Cancer Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unexplained variation in the clinical management of prostate cancer is recognized as an important problem in cancer treatment. To investigate potential explanations for this variation, the proposed project uses a social network analytic approach to model the connections that exist between physicians caring for patients with prostate cancer. This approach explicitly recognizes the clinical reality that many patients face: they see multiple physicians for their screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care across a range of clinical venues and at various times. Not only does each physician contribute to the type and quality of care patients receive but also the relationships between physicians within a geographical region may be an important and modifiable determinant of care. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to map the connections between PCPs, urologists, and radiation oncologists as a network and examine whether specialists' positions in the network structure are related to their patient's prostate cancer treatment; (2) to determine whether the network structure helps explain observed differences in prostate cancer treatment between black and white men; and (3) to investigate the determinants of the network structure through a survey of PCPs about their referral decisions. To achieve these aims, this project uses SEER-Medicare claims data and a survey of PCPs. The SEER- Medicare sample consists of men with localized prostate cancer diagnosed from 1995-2005 and their associated PCP and specialist providers. The position of specialists in the cancer care networks will be quantitatively determined and the positions will be related to patient-level variation in the type and quality of cancer care and to racial differences in care. The survey of PCPs will elucidate the factors important in their referral decisions. Understanding observed variations may suggest ways that the network structure may be leveraged to improve quality in cancer care and reduce disparities in outcomes. The candidate, Craig Pollack, MD, MHS is an Assistant Professor in the Division of General Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine with a joint appointment in the Department of Epidemiology and membership in the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. His long-term goal is to become an independent, grant-funded health services researcher in the field of cancer control. His short-term goals are to develop expertise in cancer prevention and control, network analysis, advanced health services research methods, and organizational theory and provider behavior. Dr. Pollack has assembled a mentoring team that includes national leaders in cancer research, urological cancer, health disparities, and network analysis. The proposed project provides Dr. Pollack with the training, mentoring, and resources to become a successful independent investigator dedicated to improving cancer care.              Project Narrative Though prostate cancer is very common among older men, there exists a great deal of variation in how patients with early disease get treated.

"Oxidative Stress, Antioxidants and Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This career development award will provide crucial training and experience in population genetics, bioinformatics, haplotyping, and tag SNP identification for Cathryn Bock, Ph.D. She is an Assistant Professor at Karmanos Cancer Institute and Wayne State University, proposing formal training and research under the mentorship of Ann Schwartz, Ph.D. and Rick Kittles, Ph.D., who have considerable expertise in these areas. In addition to attending relevant classes, seminars, and meetings, she will examine genes in the oxidative stress pathway, antioxidant intake and their potential interaction effects on racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence and progression in a sample of African American (AA) and European American men from metropolitan Detroit. Despite the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with prostate cancer, neither the etiology of the disease is not well characterized, nor are the large racial disparities. Oxidative stress has been proposed as one mechanism of prostate cancer initiation and progression, and early evidence supports this hypothesis. However, the specific role of genes in the oxidative stress pathway and their interactions with dietary and supplemental antioxidants are not yet well understood. Furthermore, it is possible that some of the racial differences in prostate cancer risk and progression may be explained by differences in genes involved in the oxidative stress pathway and their interaction with antioxidant intake. Therefore, this study will first estimate ancestry of the AA subjects using ancestry-informative markers from a previous study. Tag SNPs in three genes in the oxidative stress pathway, SOD2, OGG1, and GPX1 will then be identified. We will next assess whether variation in these genes modifies prostate cancer risk associated with intake of the antioxidants vitamin E, selenium and lycopene. Furthermore, each of these potential interactions will be examined by race and by prostate cancer aggressiveness to see if these oxidative stress pathway measures explain racial differences or disease progression. All analyses within the AA men will control for ancestry. DMA for analysis, interview, questionnaire, and medical record data will come from participants in an existing case-control study of prostate cancer in which enrollment recently was completed (PI: Benjamin A. Rybicki, Ph.D.). There are 275 AA men and 362 EA men with prostate cancer and 99 AA and 125 EA age- and race-matched men without prostate cancer enrolled in the case-control study with available data and blood samples and eligible for inclusion. This training is essential for Dr. Bock's transition to being an independent researcher in the genetic epidemiology of cancer. The identification of genetic markers for prostate cancer risk and progression, and of racial differences in the interaction of these markers with intake of antioxidants will improve screening techniques and prevention targeting efforts.          ","Oxidative Stress, Antioxidants and Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer",8128584,K07CA119109,"['Medical Records ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Modeling ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Testing ', ' professor ', ' Participant ', ' Age ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Area ', ' Prevention ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' improved ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' American ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Measures ', ' Research Training ', ' Institutes ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' experience ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' meetings ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Genes ', ' Sampling ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Data ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Universities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Population ', ' African ', ' metropolitan ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Mentorship ', ' Superoxide Dismutase ', ' cytocuprein ', ' Hemocuprein ', ' Erythrocuprein ', ' Incidence ', ' European ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Intake ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Techniques ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' cancer risk ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Interview ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' SOD2 gene ', ' SOD2 ', ' Oxidative Stress Pathway ', ' Oxidative Stress Induced Gene Expression Via Nrf2 ', ' lycopene ', ' psi,psi-carotene ', ' Lyc-O-Mato ', ' Vitamin E ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Selenium ', ' Se element ', ' cancer initiation ', ' glutathione peroxidase ', ' OGG1 gene ', ' OGH1 Gene ', ' OGG1 ', ' N-Glycosylase/DNA Lyase Gene ', ' MUTM Gene ', ' MMH Gene ', ' Gene-Modified ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,K07,2011,132921,0.3131696686278995
"Pten-loss Dysregulated Pathways in Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths (after lung cancer) in American men, and the morbidity and the mortality to PCa are even higher in African American men as compared Caucasians. Molecular mechanisms leading to the initiation and progression of PCa including castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or androgen insensitive prostate cancer (AI-PC) are poorly understood. PTEN and p53 are the two most frequently deleted and/ or mutated genes in a variety of human cancers including advanced PCa. Loss of PTEN leads to the hyperactivation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) and serine/Thr kinase (Akt/PKB). Pten-deficient mice develop high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and invasive adenocarcinoma. We have recently demonstrated in our mouse model that the acute inactivation of Pten unexpectedly elicits cellular senescence, a novel mechanism suppressing cancer progression. Aberrant regulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors including p19Arf, p53 and p21 proteins have been observed in prostate tumors of Pten-deficient mice. We hypothesize that aberrant activation of p19Arf-p53 pathways cooperates with Pten loss to result in prostate cancer progression. We propose to test this hypothesis and to study the molecular mechanisms of regulating Pten-p19Arf-p53 network in prostate cancer using mouse models and cell lines with following Specific Aims: 1) To define the role of p19Arf in prostate cancer progression. 2) To determine the functional roles of p19Arf in the crosstalk of Pten and p53 during tumorigenesis. 3) To address the consequence and relevance of p19Arf inactivation in CRPC growth using Pten/p53 mouse model. Results obtained from this award will provide us valuable insights into novel roles of ARF in prostate cancer progression.               Project Narrative The goal of this project is to elucidate Pten-loss dysregulated pathways in prostate cancer (PCa) by defining novel roles of p19Arf in prostate cancer progression including castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) growth.

"Mitochondrial Genetics in Prostate Cancer Health Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a dramatic and unexplained racial/ethnic disparity in prostate cancer in the US. African Americans (AA) are 1.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 2.4 times more likely to die from prostate cancer than Caucasian Americans (CA). While it is likely that multiple factors account for this disparity, genetic predisposition may account for a substantial proportion. We have discovered that inherited mutations in the mitochondrial genome are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer and that AA males have very different mutations in this genome than CA and that AA men have significantly greater rates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations than CA. The overall hypothesis we will test is that race-specific missense mtDNA mutations that are found in the germ line of AA and CA men with prostate cancer alter mitochondrial biology so as to enhance prostate cancer growth and survival. Because of our ongoing 10-year prospective specimen banking protocol we have biologic specimens (including peripheral blood DNA) and clinical data on over 1000 men that have undergone radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer at Emory University Hospital. Because of technical advances in mtDNA sequencing, the entire mitochondrial genome (~16.5 kb) can be rapidly and reliably sequenced by chip based methods. We are therefore uniquely positioned to rapidly perform sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome in AA and CA men with prostate cancer and propose sequencing 50 men from each racial group and comparing the mtDNA mutations. All individuals with missense mutations will be contacted for further phlebotomy and the establishment of lymphoblast cell lines that will allow us to ""capture"" these mtDNA mutations and generate prostate cancer cell lines with prostate cancer relevant mtDNA mutations. Each mutation will be paired with an appropriate control cell line that differs by a single mtDNA base change. These mutant/control pairs will then undergo analysis of respiratory complex activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation thereby allowing us to assign functionality of the observed mutations. We will also test antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents for their ability to reverse the cell biologic derangements caused by the prostate cancer specific mtDNA mutations. If successful, these studies will define the functionality of mtDNA mutations in prostate cancer, the role they play in the racial disparity of prostate cancer, and begin to determine treatments that may be particularly effective in preventing mtDNA mutation induced cancer predisposition allowing mutation-specific treatments to be selected. The potential impact is far reaching because mitochondrial variation has now been identified as an important feature of cancer, heart disease, neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes and optic neuropathy, all associated with mitochondrial mutations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will study racial differences (health disparities) in prostate cancer genetics. Specifically, we will determine all mutations in the mitochondrial DNA in a group of African American and Caucasian American men with prostate cancer. Once mutations are identified they will be studied in the laboratory to determine how they exert their effects on cancer and what anti-cancer drugs might be used to treat patients with these mitochondrial DNA mutations. The ultimate use of this research is both to understand the basic abnormalities that account for racial differences in prostate cancer and to identify mutation-specific treatments.           This project will study racial differences (health disparities) in prostate cancer genetics.

"Genomics and Predictive Modeling of Prostate Cancer Heath Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) men have an increased incidence and earlier age of onset of prostate cancer and two-fold higher rate of mortality from disease than Caucasian American (CA) men that does not correlate with socioeconomic status. Recent work in the PI's laboratory has shed light on the organization of the genomes of metastatic prostate cancers and primary prostate cancers from CA and AA men and has demonstrated that innate tumor characteristics may contribute to the observed health disparities. Compared to normal, non-cancerous genomes, the tumor genomes contain copy number alteration (CNA) gains or losses of genes that mediate initiation and progression. When matched for age, Gleason score and stage, the genomes of primary AA prostate cancers have a greater number of CNAs that predispose to metastasis compared to the genomes of CA prostate cancers. This study will validate the initial prostate cancer metastatic potential/health disparity study through somatic genomic DNA copy number analysis. A risk metric will be developed for each CNA that will be incorporated into a model that estimates the likelihood that a tumor will metastasize. The genetic predictors will be combined with clinical risk predictors to develop and evaluate a comprehensive statistical risk assessment model. Areas under the receiver-operator curves will be assessed to measure and compare the discriminatory accuracy. Paired analyses will be performed to demonstrate the presence of similar CNA profiles in biopsy and corresponding radical prostatectomy tumor specimens. In addition, whole genome sequencing will be applied to AA and CA tumors of different characteristics - primaries of different metastatic potential and metastases. These will be analyzed for mutations, duplications, and deletions that may have had a causal role.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project is built on a study that identified innate genomic differences of AA and CA prostate cancers through a novel application of natural selection theory. The research of tumor biology will translate into a risk model for determining whether prostate cancers should be treated aggressively or with watchful waiting.

"Novel nanotechnology approach to target prostate cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In many cases malignant transformation can be directly linked to activation of the STAT family of transcription factors. Two major STAT isoforms have been characterized: the full-length transcription factor and C-terminal truncated isoforms that lack the transactivation domain. Constitutive activation of STAT5 proteins has been demonstrated in many diverse human cancer cell lines and clinical tumors including those of the prostate. Furthermore, our studies provide evidence that STAT5B, but not STAT5A, contributes to tumor progression. Increased activation of STAT5 correlates with aggressive behavior of prostate cancer while the naturally occurring dominant-negative truncated isoform, STAT5?B blocks tumorigenic abilities cancer cells. Therefore, the overall hypothesis of this proposal is that ectopic expression of the dominant-negative truncated isoform STAT5?B, a tumor suppressor, in place of the proto-oncogene STAT5B reverses carcinogenesis. The rationale of this study is that validation of this hypothesis can lead to novel approaches and the development of disease-intervention strategies in the treatment of prostate cancer and likely, other malignances. We propose to substitute expression of STAT5B (proto-oncogene) with the dominant-negative truncated isoform STAT5?B (tumor suppressor) applying pHLIP nanotechnology for delivery of splice-switching oligonucleotides to block alternative splicing. The proposed work combines recently acquired knowledge on regulation and action of specific genes involved in prostate cancer progression with a novel nanotechnology-based approach for targeted delivery of DNA specifically in tumors. Aim1: To investigate the efficacy of the steric-blocking by splice-switching oligonucleotide (SSO) conjugates with pH insertion peptide (pHLIP) to block alternative splicing of STATs mRNA in vitro. The hypothesis of this aim is that pHLIP is well suited to target delivery of splice switching DNA into tumor cells. The rationale of this aim is that optimization of SSO delivery employing pHLIP is necessary to attempt this strategy in vivo. Aim2: To test the ability of pHLIP-SSOs directed to induce expression of STAT5?B to block prostate cancer in vivo. The hypothesis of this aim is that application of the pHLIP-SSO technology will induce ectopic expression of STAT5?B (tumor suppressor) in place of STAT5B (proto-oncogene) in the Athymic Nude Mouse Model System. The rationale of this aim is based on the overall hypothesis of this proposal that ectopic expression of the dominant-negative truncated isoform STAT5?B in place of the proto-oncogene STAT5B can reverse carcinogenesis. The modulation of STAT5B isoform expression represents a model for the development of a novel therapeutic approach not only for prostate cancer but also for other diseases caused by defective pre-mRNA splicing. The successful completion of this work is anticipated to open new avenues for chemotherapeutic disease intervention strategies based on the proposed combination of pHLIP nanotechnology and a novel approach to switching expression from a proto- oncogene to a tumor suppressor.

"The 2nd Biennial Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men of Af     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the prostate cancer (CaP) incidence rates in the overall US population has declined in recent years, mortality from CaP is two to three times greater among Black men compared to White men. To date the disparate incidence of CaP in Black men in the US compared to their Caucasian counterparts is poorly understood. Of further concern is the growing literature on the burden of CaP among other Black men in the Caribbean, the United Kingdom and West Africa. Although Black men may share a common genetic risk locus contributing to the higher incidence of CaP, the etiology of the variability in risk observed among Black men living in varying environments and cultures highlights the strong and evolving knowledge of the contribution of behavioral factors that may modify these biological risk factors. Our preliminary observations and that of others point to the fact that it s important for us to study the behavioral, environmental and genetic determinants of CaP among Black men using common methodologies and uniform instruments. Global collaborations among CaP scientists, clinicians and advocates are thus important to understand CaP etiology and develop interventions that will effectively address CaP disparities. In 2010, the 1st biennial conference on ""The Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men"" was held in Jacksonville Florida, August 27 -29, 2010. Supported by the National Cancer Institute (R13 CA144439), the first conference was an overwhelming success. To continue to develop and maintain our global community of practice, the objective of this conference grant application is to bring CaP scientists, clinicians, survivors, and advocates together to share cross cutting CaP research issues and develop the next research priorities to achieve prostate health equity globally. The 2nd biennial conference will be held in The Bahamas from Nov 1 - 4, 2012. The theme for the 2012 conference is ""The Global Burden of Prostate Cancer: Economic, Clinical and Humanistic Outcomes"".        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The 2nd Biennial conference on ""The Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men"" is proposed to bring CaP scientists, clinicians, survivors, and advocates together to share cross cutting CaP research issues and develop the next research priorities to achieve prostate health equity globally.              The 2nd Biennial conference on ""The Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men"" is proposed to bring CaP scientists, clinicians, survivors, and advocates together to share cross cutting CaP research issues and develop the next research priorities to achieve prostate health equity globally.            ",The 2nd Biennial Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men of Af,8400037,R13CA171754,"['Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Bahamas ', ' Books ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Belief ', ' abstracting ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Americas ', ' Africa ', ' Health ', ' Goals ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Feedback ', ' Environment ', ' Economics ', ' Florida ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Memory ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Lions ', ' Panthera leo ', ' Incidence ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Publishing ', ' Spiders ', ' Proverb ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Clinical ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' Amaze ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Biological ', ' Time ', ' Caucasians ', ' Science ', ' Training Programs ', ' United Kingdom ', ' Work ', ' instrument ', ' interest ', ' Research Priority ', ' Scientist ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Life ', ' Collaborations ', ' hearing disease ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' Hearing problem ', ' programs ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' African ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Survivors ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' infectious organism ', ' Infectious Agent ', ' Genetic ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' 8q24 ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Community Practice ', ' Behavioral ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' Data ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' International ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Outcome ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R13,2012,20000,0.20993604935012525
"Advoactes Role in Prostate Cancer Screening Decisions by Rural African American    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to examine how and why rural African American (AA) males decide to be screened for prostate cancer, with a specific focus on the role that the social networks of these men - their ""health care advocates"" - play in that decision. Rural AAs have been identified as both the most underserved and the most understudied population in the United States 3, 4 .No other studies have examined this critical element of AA men's cancer-related decision making processes. This exploratory study has three primary aims: Aim 1 is to explore who fills the role of ""health care advocate"" for rural AA men, how these individuals enact this role and what influence they have related to prostate cancer screening knowledge and decision-making of rural-dwelling AA men. Aim 2 is to explore how rural AA men perceive their communications with health care providers regarding prostate cancer screening. Aim 3 is to identify decisions made and explore the factors (health literacy, prostate cancer knowledge, decisional conflict and desire for control over health decisions) that influence prostate cancer screening decisions made among rural AA men. We will conduct a sequential mixed- method study starting with a baseline evaluation using qualitative interviews and a grounded theory approach along with quantitative surveys of both rural AA men and their health care advocate(s). Demographic data will be obtained and health literacy will be measured using the Shortened Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. Concurrent semi-structured interviews with the male participant and health care advocate(s) will uncover patterns, themes, and be used to generate a theory about how rural AA men make prostate cancer screening decisions. Moreover, their perceptions, as well as the advocate's perceptions, of the influence of advocates on those decisions will be discovered. We will compare and contrast these perceptions, and link them with quantitative survey data. Selection of measures for the quantitative surveys was based on Briss et al.'s (2004) informed decision model. Measures will include prostate cancer knowledge, decisional conflict and desire for control over health decisions. The second stage will include a 6 and 12 month follow-up telephone survey with the male participant. Using quantitative questions, we will assess whether the male participant chose/did not choose prostate cancer screening, and whether he experienced changes in prostate cancer knowledge, decisional conflict or desire for control over health decisions. We also will compare and or confirm the qualitative findings with follow-up open ended questions developed and added from the analysis of the qualitative findings at baseline. This research is consistent with the National Cancer Institute Strategic Objective 8: Overcome Cancer Health Disparities3. The study is significant in that rural AA men are a remarkably understudied group at great risk for health disparities. Pending the results of this project, the investigative team plans a larger and more expansive study including health care providers' perspectives (e.g. R01 application). 1         Prostate cancer deaths among African American (AA) men in the United States are 2.4 times higher than among Caucasian men 1. Additionally, rural African Americans have been identified as both the most underserved and the most understudied population in the United States 3, 4. The primary purpose of this study is to provide in-depth information about factors that influence rural African American males' decision to undergo screening for prostate cancer, with a specific focus on the role that the social networks of these men - their ""health care advocates"" - play in that decision.

"METABOLOMIC PROFILING AND BIOLOGIC BASIS OF RACIAL DISPARITY IN PROSTATE CANCER     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of our research plan is to reduce the disproportionate effects of prostate cancer on African American men. A guiding principle of our methodology is biochemical differences exist between prostate cancers of African American and European American origin and that these differences can explain, in part, prostate cancer health disparity. In this application, we propose to use the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover these underlying differences. Metabolomics describes the science of quantifying the levels of metabolites (e.g., small molecules) that are the byproducts of cellular metabolism. That is to say, in this kind of analysis we are measuring the biochemical entities (or metabolites) that are produced by the functional machinery of the cell. With knowledge of the identity of specific metabolites we can infer the biological processes that produced them, thus gaining insight into a cell's metabolism. To date, a metabolomic analysis of prostate cancer health disparity has not been reported. In preliminary studies, we have profiled the metabolome of prostate cancers from African-American and European American men and have identified specific racially distinct metabololites as well as biological pathways associated with each. In this proposal, we will i) validate and refine the metabolomic profile of prostate cancers from African American and European American men, ii) evaluate the role of specific biochemical pathways in prostate cancers of African American and European American men and iii) develop urine based metabolic markers for high risk prostate cancer in African American and European American men. At the conclusion of this study, we will have developed a racially derived metabolomic model for prostate cancer as well as identified candidate pathways for future drug targeting.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, it is not known how the prostate cancer metabolome contributes to health disparities. The information gleaned from this proposal could rapidly revolutionize current diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches by revealing the biological underpinnings of prostate cancer health disparity.                At present, it is not known how the prostate cancer metabolome contributes to health disparities.

"MICRORNAS in AFRICAN AMERICAN PROSTATE CANCER    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate cancer (PCa) disproportionally affects African American men (AA) who have 60 percent higher incidence rate and twice the death rate of Caucasian men (CA), and is the second leading cause of cancer- related deaths in AA men probably due to a more aggressive disease. While socioeconomic factors contribute to this health disparity, they do not fully explain the differences in prostate cancer incidence, aggressiveness, and mortality among different ethnic groups. Non-coding RNAs, especially, miRNAs have emerged for their important gene regulatory function and their roles in regulating multiple coding genes and thereby modulate several biological pathways including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metastasis and angiogenesis. Recent studies have identified distinct miRNA expression in serum of cancer patients and have suggested their usefulness as molecular targets and as biomarkers to predict progression from preneoplasia to cancer and outcome/prognosis of cancer patients. Very little is known about racial differences in the expression of these miRNA in cancers like prostate cancer that disproportionally affect AA men. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that miRNA dysregulation in serum might be associated with PCa progression and PCa health disparities with potential to be developed as molecular target(s) and minimally invasive biomarker(s). The specific aims are: (1) Study the expression of miR-101, miR-25 and miR-628-5p in prostate cancer where we will compare the expression of these miRNAs in (a) serum from 50 AA and 50 CA and (b) tissues from 50 AA and 50 CA prostate cancer patients by Q-PCR. (2) Examine the effects of miR-101, miR-25 and miR-628-5p gain- and loss-of-function on the neoplastic phenotype of prostate cancer and their oncogenic activity in normal prostate cells. This proposal will (i) establish a basis to study the expression pattern of these miRNAs in diverse serum samples and (ii) generate preliminary data for continued mechanistic investigation of miRNA biology in prostate cancer health disparities. Our future studies will validate these miRNAs in a wider population and examine the involvement of these miRNAs in the tumor biology of AA prostate cancer.           This R21 exploratory grant will generate data to support future research projects including basic science research and case control studies elucidating the role of these miRNAs in prostate cancer risk, validating miRNA targets, their regulation and biological functions. In the long term, these studies could have significant public health consequences as involvement of these miRNAs in African American prostate cancer will support their development as molecular targets and biomarkers for early detection, prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.

"Basic Cancer Research in Cancer Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common lethal tumor among US males yet little is known about its causative mechanisms. This study proposes to examine how glycosylation of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) affects steroid hormone signaling in prostate cancer. We will define the impact of SHBG glycosylation, including the D327N SHBG polymorphism, on steroid hormone associated prostate cancer risk and disparity in African and Caucasian Americans. Protein glycosylation is critical for interaction of prostate cells with its environment. We will evaluate how glycosylation of SHBG affect the distribution of the protein between plasma and tissue and how this affects disease development. The quantification of the SHBG glycoforms will be achieved by novel LC-MS assays. In addition, we will comprehensively summarize the impact of polymorphisms on N-glycosylation in the human proteome. Our hypothesis is that prostate cancer risk and progression are related to the variability in the glycosylation of SHBG. Our objective is to perform quantitative mass spectrometric assays of SHBG glycosylation in conjunction with measurement of steroid hormones. We will select men for phenotypic characterization by genotyping of a case control population with 50% African American representation. In addition, we will genotype a case series for which both serum and tissue are available. Steroid hormones will be measured by GC-MS. We will analyze the SHBG glycoforms and steroid hormones at the tissue level and in the circulation. The study is expected to fill important gaps in our understanding of prostate cancer etiology and progression. The analysis of SHBG glycoforms will provide new information on the biological factors underlying prostate carcinogenesis. The results are expected to improve prostate cancer prevention, detection and intervention strategies.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is important because a comparative analysis of SHBG glycosylation and steroid hormones in prostate cancer, especially in African American men, has not been previously undertaken. We are proposing the first large scale examination of SHBG site occupancy in prostate cancer and health disparity of the disease. The newly established informatic resources and methods are expected to stimulate novel cancer prevention and health disparity studies.               This research is important because a comparative analysis of SHBG glycosylation and steroid hormones in prostate cancer, especially in African American men, has not been previously undertaken.

"Biological and Environmental modifiers of Vitamin D3 and Prostate Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in prostate cancer (Pca) are caused by complex interactions of genetic susceptibility, individual risk factors, and environmental factors. Pca is the second leading cause of death among all men; however African American (AA) men have the highest mortality rate of Pca of any racial/ethnic group in the U.S. This difference in mortality accounts for 44% of the overall cancer mortality disparity between AA and European-American (EA) men. Thus, there is a critical need to explore the etiologic pathways that contribute to this disparity. Unfortunately, the only well-established risk factors (age, race and family history) for Pca are non-modifiable. However recent studies have found low levels of vitamin D have been associated with increased Pca risk, and treatment with vitamin D has reduced Pca disease progression in multiple studies. These studies support the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of Pca and that vitamin D is a potential chemopreventive and therapeutic agent. Although genetic and environmental factors including common low penetrant alleles, diet, body mass index (BMI), and vitamin D levels may affect risk, their significance and multiple joint effects are unclear. Extensive data exists in support of a critical role for Vitamin D3 [25(OH) vitamin D] on Pca risk. However, it is difficult to determine its importance mainly because Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin, and serum levels are strongly influenced by skin color, genetic ancestry, age, BMI, and environmental factors such as sunlight exposure and diet. The goal of this project is to explore the effects of serum Vitamin D, UVR exposure, skin color, age, BMI, and genes involved in Vitamin D synthesis, metabolism and signaling on Pca and aggressive Pca risk in a study of 2,000 AA and 2,000 EA men. Men aged 40-79 will be recruited from a consortium of Chicago hospitals including, the University Illinois a Chicago Hospital System, University of Chicago Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, John H. Stroger Cook County Hospital, and the Jesse Brown Veteran Affairs Medical Center. This project will improve our understanding of the role Vitamin D plays on prostate cancer susceptibility, specifically among African Americans, and if lower vitamin D levels in AAs account for a portion of the disparity in Pca incidence and mortality between AAs and EAs. More importantly, given that UVR and diet are general environmental exposures that can be easily modified, understanding their impact may have broad health implications.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vitamin D has been shown to induce differentiation of prostate cells and to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. There has been epidemiologic evidence linking vitamin D status to breast, colon and prostate cancer. Prospective studies have been lacking and among the literature there have been inconclusive results. Notably, these studies are lacking in numbers of men of African ancestry who are likely to have aggressive prostate cancer and to be more vitamin D deficient. Also the studies fail to look at the interaction of vitamin D level, sun exposure, skin color, and genetic variation in genes in the vitamin D synthesis and metabolism pathway. Here we will propose a prospective study of serum vitamin D (25-OH D) levels and prostate cancer risk among African American and European American men aged 40-79. The study will be conducted at five Chicago area institutions, the University Illinois at Chicago Hospital System, University of Chicago Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, John H. Stroger Cook County Hospital, and the Jesse Brown Veteran Affairs Medical Center in Chicago.              Vitamin D has been shown to induce differentiation of prostate cells and to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines.

"A Network Analytic Approach to Modeling Variation in Prostate Cancer Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unexplained variation in the clinical management of prostate cancer is recognized as an important problem in cancer treatment. To investigate potential explanations for this variation, the proposed project uses a social network analytic approach to model the connections that exist between physicians caring for patients with prostate cancer. This approach explicitly recognizes the clinical reality that many patients face: they see multiple physicians for their screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care across a range of clinical venues and at various times. Not only does each physician contribute to the type and quality of care patients receive but also the relationships between physicians within a geographical region may be an important and modifiable determinant of care. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to map the connections between PCPs, urologists, and radiation oncologists as a network and examine whether specialists' positions in the network structure are related to their patient's prostate cancer treatment; (2) to determine whether the network structure helps explain observed differences in prostate cancer treatment between black and white men; and (3) to investigate the determinants of the network structure through a survey of PCPs about their referral decisions. To achieve these aims, this project uses SEER-Medicare claims data and a survey of PCPs. The SEER- Medicare sample consists of men with localized prostate cancer diagnosed from 1995-2005 and their associated PCP and specialist providers. The position of specialists in the cancer care networks will be quantitatively determined and the positions will be related to patient-level variation in the type and quality of cancer care and to racial differences in care. The survey of PCPs will elucidate the factors important in their referral decisions. Understanding observed variations may suggest ways that the network structure may be leveraged to improve quality in cancer care and reduce disparities in outcomes. The candidate, Craig Pollack, MD, MHS is an Assistant Professor in the Division of General Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine with a joint appointment in the Department of Epidemiology and membership in the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. His long-term goal is to become an independent, grant-funded health services researcher in the field of cancer control. His short-term goals are to develop expertise in cancer prevention and control, network analysis, advanced health services research methods, and organizational theory and provider behavior. Dr. Pollack has assembled a mentoring team that includes national leaders in cancer research, urological cancer, health disparities, and network analysis. The proposed project provides Dr. Pollack with the training, mentoring, and resources to become a successful independent investigator dedicated to improving cancer care.              Project Narrative Though prostate cancer is very common among older men, there exists a great deal of variation in how patients with early disease get treated. Using a technique called social network analysis, we examine how the connections and referral patterns between primary care physicians and specialists may influence the type, quality and equity of care that men receive.",A Network Analytic Approach to Modeling Variation in Prostate Cancer Care,8296492,K07CA151910,"['Affect ', ' Appointment ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health behavior ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Urologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Urological Cancer ', ' Urinary Tract Cancer ', ' Malignant Urinary Tract Neoplasm ', ' Urologic Cancer ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Radiation Oncologist ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Collection ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' working group ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' older men ', ' effective intervention ', ' Medicare claim ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K07,2012,156570,0.26712657279359514
"Community-Based Research to Improve Prostate Cancer Patient Treatment Decisions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians recognize the need for and support informed decision making as a mechanism for helping men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer and are considering treatment. Men need help to reduce decisional regret, reduce decisional conflict, improve satisfaction with their treatment decisions and develop a plan for coping with the sequelae of quality-of-life compromising side effects. A variety of factors interact at multiple socio-ecologic levels to facilitate or prevent informed decision making from occurring. The manner in which culture influences prostate cancer treatment decision-making among African Americans remains understudied. Research from other health contexts strongly suggests that participatory action research can be helpful in generating new culturally appropriate knowledge to apply to this problem. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that interventions developed using participatory research approaches are effective for improving informed treatment decision making for prostate cancer with African-American men. The purpose of the current Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) grant application is to provide the applicant, a newly appointed assistant professor of oncology at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI), with appropriate training and research experience that will enable him to function as an independent investigator building a research program in disparities and prostate cancer. Support provided by this training grant will provide Dr. Ross with sufficient release time (75%) to complete a career development plan that consists of carefully selected didactic coursework, individualized instruction, seminars, and research experiences grounded in applied ethnographic and community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. The aims of Dr. Ross' proposed research are (1) to formalize and strengthen a community-research partnership between a group of prostate cancer advocates and the Office of Cancer Health Disparities Research at Roswell Park Cancer Institute that will guide community driven cancer educational initiatives; (2) to conduct ethnographic research with African-American men and their significant others to provide a holistic, contextualized description of their experiences with prostate cancer treatment; and (3) to use a participatory research approach to create a culturally appropriate treatment decision-making intervention for African- American men and their significant others. The proposed training and experience in ethnography and CBPR will yield rich insights into prostate cancer education for hard-to-reach, high risk populations. It will also contribute vital information to the fields of health education and behavior to enhance cancer control.

"Genome-wide sequencing of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men have two times or more the incidence rate of prostate cancer than other U.S. populations, and high rates of prostate cancer are also seen in other African and African-derived populations. It is generally accepted that both common and rare genetic variants contribute to risk of complex diseases such as prostate cancer, however their relative contributions to overall heritability is a subject of intense controversy. For rare variants to have a significant influence on the risk of complex disease the spectrum of effect sizes must be considerably larger in magnitude than for common variants; to date however there is only limited evidence for or against this hypothesis since the means of comprehensively testing rare variation in the genome has not been possible until very recently. In this proposal we seek to test the contributions of both common and rare genetic variants to the risk of prostate cancer in men of American ancestry using a targeted genome-wide association study approach. In Aim 1 we plan to sequence (at 30x coverage) the exome and regulatory regions (~160 Mb) of the genome, as defined by epigenetic marks in prostate cancer cell lines, in 1,000 men of African ancestry (500 with aggressive disease) and 1,000 controls. Both single SNP and burden of rare variants analyses will be performed and replication testing of the most statistically significant sequence variations (~24,000) will be examined in additional samples of African ancestry (6,000 cases and 6,000 controls) through the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer (AAPC) consortium. In addition to association testing of single variants, we will conduct ""burden of rare variants analyses"" of coding and non-coding variants at the gene and pathway level. In Aim 2, we will examine interactions between associated variants, environmental factors (thereby better defining the role of these factors) and disease severity. In Aim 3, we will assess biological function of the novel risk alleles identified in Aim 1 using a staged approach of eQTL analysis followed by in vitro analyses of enhancer activity as well as allele-specific effects. This proposal spans the spectrum of genetic epidemiologic research in prostate cancer, from genetic discovery (for all prostate cancer as well as aggressive disease) to gene environment interaction testing, to biological understanding. We expect this work to significantly advance knowledge of the etiology of prostate cancer and racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer risk, and to guide the development of future preventive, early detection, prognostic and even therapeutic measures.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, we will conduct targeted genome-wide sequencing in men of African ancestry to reveal genetic markers that may contribute to their greater risk of prostate cancer. We expect findings from this study will make a major contribution to our understanding of genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer and the genetic basis underlying familial aggregation and heritability of this common cancer. Identifying more genetic predictors of risk will have widespread applicability and significance, leading to better risk models to more accurately predict a man's risk of developing prostate cancer, and better intensive screening and preventive strategies that target men at high risk.                      In this proposal, we will conduct targeted genome-wide sequencing in men of African ancestry to reveal genetic markers that may contribute to their greater risk of prostate cancer.

"Pten-loss Dysregulated Pathways in Prostate Cancer  Pten-loss Dysregulated Pathways in Prostate Cancer Summary Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths (after lung cancer) in American men, and the morbidity and the mortality to PCa are even higher in African American men as compared Caucasians. Molecular mechanisms leading to the initiation and progression of PCa including castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or androgen insensitive prostate cancer (AI-PC) are poorly understood. PTEN and p53 are the two most frequently deleted and/ or mutated genes in a variety of human cancers including advanced PCa. Loss of PTEN leads to the hyperactivation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) and serine/Thr kinase (Akt/PKB). Pten-deficient mice develop high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and invasive adenocarcinoma. We have recently demonstrated in our mouse model that the acute inactivation of Pten unexpectedly elicits cellular senescence, a novel mechanism suppressing cancer progression. Aberrant regulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors including p19Arf, p53 and p21 proteins have been observed in prostate tumors of Pten-deficient mice. We HYPOTHESIZE that aberrant activation of p19Arf-p53 pathways cooperates with Pten loss to result in prostate cancer progression. We propose to test this hypothesis and to study the molecular mechanisms of regulating Pten-p19Arf-p53 network in prostate cancer using mouse models and cell lines with following Specific Aims: 1. to define the role of p19Arf in prostate cancer progression. 2. to determine the functional roles of p19Arf in the crosstalk of Pten and p53 during tumorigenesis. 3. to address the consequence and relevance of p19Arf inactivation in CRPC growth using Pten/p53 mouse model. Results obtained from this award will provide us valuable insights into novel roles of ARF in prostate cancer progression.  Project Narrative The goal of this project is to elucidate Pten-loss dysregulated pathways in prostate cancer (PCa) by defining novel roles of p19Arf in prostate cancer progression including castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) growth. Results will provide significant insights into understanding of mechanisms on the incidence and the mortality of PCa, and disparities among ethnic and racial groups.",Pten-loss Dysregulated Pathways in Prostate Cancer,8259702,R01MD004038,"['Malignant Adenoma ', ' Adenocarcinoma ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgens ', ' Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mouse mutant ', ' Mutant Strains Mice ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Financial well-being following prostate cancer diagnosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer research has consistently shown evidence of racial/ethnic disparities across the cancer  continuum from detection/screening and treatment-related outcomes to mortality; and socioeconomic status  (SES) has been suggested as a substantial factor in the racial differences; yet, the research results for SES  disparities i prostate cancer-related outcomes as well as SES as an explanatory factor in racial/ethnic  disparities in prostate cancer have been inconsistent. Some have suggested that this inconsistency may be due to imprecise (and inconsistent or incomplete) measurement of socioeconomic circumstances.   Thus, there have been calls in the cancer disparities literature for greater clarity on the pathways and mechanisms causing differential cancer outcomes across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the conceptualization AND operationalization of socioeconomic circumstances in this literature.  An expanded view of the socioeconomic context for prostate cancer patients might uncover socioeconomic factors influencing disparities in treatment-related outcomes over and above the traditional SES measures; and a construct to capture this expanded socioeconomic context is financial well-being (FWB).  The  specific aims of the research project are to:  1) Develop and refine a conceptual model of the multidimensional  construct FWB using structured interviews with prostate cancer patients and a focus group with clinical social  workers; 2) Develop and pilot test a measure of FWB; 3) Evaluate the psychometric properties of the measure  of FWB and investigate the association between components of FWB, socio-demographic characteristics, and  treatment selection and adherence and perceived quality of treatment; and 4) Investigate differences in  responses to FWB items across racial/ethnic groups and evaluate potential measurement bias across  racial/ethnic groups. The successful completion of the research project will result in a valid measurement and causal model of FWB that articulates how the dimensions of FWB are related to prostate cancer treatment-related outcomes.  The candidate, Dr. Reginald Tucker-Seeley, is a Research Associate in the Center for Community Based Research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The proposed five year NCI Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) will provide the necessary mentoring, training, and research experiences in cancer care/health services, psycho-oncology, and measures/scale development to implement the proposed research project.  His long term career goal is to become an independent investigator developing projects to reduce socioeconomic disparities across the cancer continuum from prevention to end-of-life care.   Through this work, he plans to identify the socioeconomic pathways contributing to cancer disparities and to design innovate interventions that help individuals better manage and leverage their socioeconomic and psychosocial resources for improved health.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A more comprehensive view of socioeconomic status (SES) may help us better understand how SES is actually experienced and how it affects prostate cancer treatment and outcomes.  Our limited knowledge about both the subjective and objective mechanisms through which socioeconomic experience impacts cancer treatment constrains our understanding of the factors that contribute to cancer disparities.  Expanding our conceptualization of SES to include material and psychosocial aspects of individual socioeconomic circumstances may help us begin to unpack the complex association between socioeconomic circumstances and the various types of prostate cancer treatment selected and adherence to treatment.                  A more comprehensive view of socioeconomic status (SES) may help us better understand how SES is actually experienced and how it affects prostate cancer treatment and outcomes.

"Comprhensive Center of Excellence in Health Disparities This Center of Excellence (COE) is being submitted to address significant gaps in our knowledge about disparities prostate cancer (PCa) outcomes, and to develop interventions that can be applied to reduce these disparities between African (AA) and European (EA) Americans in Philadelphia. The mission of the proposed center is to (1) undertake research that will identify biological, behavioral, social, environmental, geospatial, physical environmental, and health care factors that influence PCa outcomes, and (2) integrate, evaluate, and disseminate this information to at-risk populations in Philadelphia communities. These factors include both individual and area-level contextual (e.g., neighborhood) variables. We anticipate that the principles of this approach will ultimately be implementable in other communities to reduce PCa disparities.   This COE builds on our existing multidisciplinary research to specifically understand role of biomarkers, patterns of care, geospatial environment, and obesity after the diagnosis of PCa. This research requires transdisciplinary collaboration across multiple disciplines represented by the investigators participating in this COE. The proposed COE intends to catalyze needed improvements in the identification of men at greatest risk of unfavorable PCa outcomes to improve access to appropriate PCa treatment with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To conduct three highly interrelated transdisciplinary, translational research projects aimed at addressing prostate cancer disparities: a) Project 1: Evaluate the role of obesity in determining unfavorable prostate cancer outcomes (C. Zeigler-Johnson, PI); Project 2: Develop predictive models for understanding biomarkers, area-level contextual factors, and individual risk factors in predicting prostate cancer outcomes (T. Rebbeck, PI); Project 3: Determine whether variation in experienced and potential health care access and quality contributes to racial differences in treatment among men with localized prostate cancer (K. Armstrong, PI). Aim 2. To create specialized shared resource cores to serve the needs of these projects and the Center, including an Administrative Core (T. Rebbeck, Director); a research core (J. Holmes and C. Branas, co-Directors); and a community core (K. Glanz, Director). Aim 3: To develop transdisciplinary training at a variety of levels to train the next generation of health disparities researchers. Through this research, community outreach, and training, we will develop a program that can identify those groups at greatest risk for an unfavorable prostate cancer outcome, and develop approaches that can be used to minimize poor outcomes and the resulting disparities that unduly burden AA men. The proposed center of excellence will integrate the knowledge obtained in our previous research  experience to develop, evaluate, and begin to implement interventions aimed at reducing prostate cancer  disparities that affect African American men in Philadelphia.",Comprhensive Center of Excellence in Health Disparities,8264104,P60MD006900,"['Affect ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mission ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Development Plans ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' American ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Improve Access ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' data modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' evidence base ', ' biomarker ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P60,2012,1366517,0.25557141544477413

"Novel nanotechnology approach to target prostate cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In many cases malignant transformation can be directly linked to activation of the STAT family of transcription factors. Two major STAT isoforms have been characterized: the full-length transcription factor and C-terminal truncated isoforms that lack the transactivation domain. Constitutive activation of STAT5 proteins has been demonstrated in many diverse human cancer cell lines and clinical tumors including those of the prostate. Furthermore, our studies provide evidence that STAT5B, but not STAT5A, contributes to tumor progression. Increased activation of STAT5 correlates with aggressive behavior of prostate cancer while the naturally occurring dominant-negative truncated isoform, STAT5?B blocks tumorigenic abilities cancer cells. Therefore, the overall hypothesis of this proposal is that ectopic expression of the dominant-negative truncated isoform STAT5?B, a tumor suppressor, in place of the proto-oncogene STAT5B reverses carcinogenesis. The rationale of this study is that validation of this hypothesis can lead to novel approaches and the development of disease-intervention strategies in the treatment of prostate cancer and likely, other malignances. We propose to substitute expression of STAT5B (proto-oncogene) with the dominant-negative truncated isoform STAT5?B (tumor suppressor) applying pHLIP nanotechnology for delivery of splice-switching oligonucleotides to block alternative splicing. The proposed work combines recently acquired knowledge on regulation and action of specific genes involved in prostate cancer progression with a novel nanotechnology-based approach for targeted delivery of DNA specifically in tumors. Aim1: To investigate the efficacy of the steric-blocking by splice-switching oligonucleotide (SSO) conjugates with pH insertion peptide (pHLIP) to block alternative splicing of STATs mRNA in vitro. The hypothesis of this aim is that pHLIP is well suited to target delivery of splice switching DNA into tumor cells. The rationale of this aim is that optimization of SSO delivery employing pHLIP is necessary to attempt this strategy in vivo. Aim2: To test the ability of pHLIP-SSOs directed to induce expression of STAT5?B to block prostate cancer in vivo. The hypothesis of this aim is that application of the pHLIP-SSO technology will induce ectopic expression of STAT5?B (tumor suppressor) in place of STAT5B (proto-oncogene) in the Athymic Nude Mouse Model System. The rationale of this aim is based on the overall hypothesis of this proposal that ectopic expression of the dominant-negative truncated isoform STAT5?B in place of the proto-oncogene STAT5B can reverse carcinogenesis. The modulation of STAT5B isoform expression represents a model for the development of a novel therapeutic approach not only for prostate cancer but also for other diseases caused by defective pre-mRNA splicing. The successful completion of this work is anticipated to open new avenues for chemotherapeutic disease intervention strategies based on the proposed combination of pHLIP nanotechnology and a novel approach to switching expression from a proto- oncogene to a tumor suppressor. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: This project aims to develop an innovative strategy for therapeutic approaches not only for prostate cancer but also for other diseases caused by defective pre-mRNA splicing. Completion of this proposal may open new avenues for chemotherapeutic disease intervention strategies based on the proposed combination of pHLIP nanotechnology and a novel approach to switching expression from a proto-oncogene to a tumor suppressor.

"MICRORNAS in AFRICAN AMERICAN PROSTATE CANCER    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate cancer (PCa) disproportionally affects African American men (AA) who have 60 percent higher incidence rate and twice the death rate of Caucasian men (CA), and is the second leading cause of cancer- related deaths in AA men probably due to a more aggressive disease. While socioeconomic factors contribute to this health disparity, they do not fully explain the differences in prostate cancer incidence, aggressiveness, and mortality among different ethnic groups. Non-coding RNAs, especially, miRNAs have emerged for their important gene regulatory function and their roles in regulating multiple coding genes and thereby modulate several biological pathways including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metastasis and angiogenesis. Recent studies have identified distinct miRNA expression in serum of cancer patients and have suggested their usefulness as molecular targets and as biomarkers to predict progression from preneoplasia to cancer and outcome/prognosis of cancer patients. Very little is known about racial differences in the expression of these miRNA in cancers like prostate cancer that disproportionally affect AA men. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that miRNA dysregulation in serum might be associated with PCa progression and PCa health disparities with potential to be developed as molecular target(s) and minimally invasive biomarker(s). The specific aims are: (1) Study the expression of miR-101, miR-25 and miR-628-5p in prostate cancer where we will compare the expression of these miRNAs in (a) serum from 50 AA and 50 CA and (b) tissues from 50 AA and 50 CA prostate cancer patients by Q-PCR. (2) Examine the effects of miR-101, miR-25 and miR-628-5p gain- and loss-of-function on the neoplastic phenotype of prostate cancer and their oncogenic activity in normal prostate cells. This proposal will (i) establish a basis to study the expression pattern of these miRNAs in diverse serum samples and (ii) generate preliminary data for continued mechanistic investigation of miRNA biology in prostate cancer health disparities. Our future studies will validate these miRNAs in a wider population and examine the involvement of these miRNAs in the tumor biology of AA prostate cancer.           This R21 exploratory grant will generate data to support future research projects including basic science research and case control studies elucidating the role of these miRNAs in prostate cancer risk, validating miRNA targets, their regulation and biological functions. In the long term, these studies could have significant public health consequences as involvement of these miRNAs in African American prostate cancer will support their development as molecular targets and biomarkers for early detection, prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.

"Clark Atlanta University Biomedical Science Development Biomedical research at Clark Atlanta University (CAU) has been supported by the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)/National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored Research Center in Minority Institutions (RCMI) program since 1985. The RCMI program at CAU over the last 20 years has been vital for the development of infrastructure for biomedical research by providing state-of-the-art equipment, recruitment of faculty and resources for individual researchers. The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) was created in 1999 with support from the RCMI program. CCRTD faculty belongs to the Departments of Biology, Chemistry and School of Education with research interests in cancer biology, drug discovery and behavioral aspects of cancer. During the current funding period, CCRTD decided to focus on the development of a nationally-recognized research program in prostate cancer. As a part of this initiative, CAU recruited three new faculty members with research programs focused on prostate cancer research and education. The well-defined and focused activities at CCRTD have resulted in increased productivity and the stature of biomedical research at CAU. During the next funding period, we will continue to expand and enhance our research activities to achieve the goals of building a world class Center dedicated to research in prostate cancer and its impact in the African-American community. The proposed specific goals are: 1) to develop and expand current research core facilities vital for carrying out research on the cellular and molecular biology of prostate cancer and 2) to recruit additional faculty who will further strengthen CCRTD. To provide additional support to CCRTD investigators, we propose to establish two new core units within CCRTD Research Support Core Facilities: Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core and Analytical Core. We also propose to recruit three additional faculty members who will be committed to high caliber research in prostate cancer biology and chemistry. Additional faculty is imperative to achieve a critical mass of scientists working in a collaborative and synergistic environment to create a world class center in prostate cancer research at CAU. This will be a unique Center of its kind at an HBCU. Prostate cancer affects the African-American community disproportionately.

"Systematic Genetic Characterization of African American Prostate Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United Sates, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and African- American men have long been known to exhibit a higher incidence and increased mortality compared to men of other ethnic groups. Although socioeconomic factors and unequal access to health care undoubtedly contribute to this disparity, differences in incidence and outcome persist after adjusting for these factors. Thus, tumor biological and/or genetic aspects may underpin adverse outcomes in African-American prostate cancer. To date, however, few studies have queried the molecular biology or somatic genetics of African-American prostate cancer in-depth, meaning that our understanding of the spectrum of factors influencing these disparities remains incomplete. The over-arching goal of this proposal is to undertake a definitive somatic genetic and functional characterization of African-American prostate cancer. To accomplish this goal, we will develop a targeted, massively parallel sequencing platform that interrogates the spectrum of recurrent alterations (base mutations, chromosomal copy number changes, and selected chromosomal rearrangements) relevant to prostate cancer. We will utilize this platform to perform tumor mutation profiling in a cohort of two hundred prostate tumor specimens obtained from African American men, leveraging knowledge from prostate cancer genome sequencing studies currently ongoing at the Broad Institute and elsewhere. Patterns of somatic alterations observed in this cohort will be compared to those of European-American prostate cancer. In addition, we will test top candidate genes affected by recurrently altered prostate cancer genomic loci for effects on the tumorigenic phenotype in primary prostate epithelial cells obtained from men of European or African descent. Once completed, this project should provide decisive insights into the spectrum of and functional relevance of somatic genetic alterations in African-American prostate cancer, thereby affirming or refuting the hypothesis that these biological factors undergird this pervasive cancer health disparity.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer in African-American men occurs more frequently, earlier in life, and with increased lethality when compared to European Americans. Undoubtedly, the genesis of this profound disparity is multi-factorial; however, a detailed study of the genetics and biology of African-American prostate cancer has not previously been undertaken. The focus of this grant is a systematic study of recurrent somatic genetic alterations in African-American prostate cancer using targeted, massively parallel sequencing. In addition, we will query specific cancer alterations in cell culture models derived from African-American and European-American patients. Upon completion, this study will likely constitute one of the most comprehensive functional genetic efforts yet undertaken in African-American prostate cancer. Insights from this study may inform new treatment strategies that prove broadly relevant across diverse human populations.              Prostate cancer in African-American men occurs more frequently, earlier in life, and with increased lethality when compared to European Americans.

"Does Dietary Antioxidant Predict Aggressiveness of Prostate Cancer?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Considerable evidence suggests that oxidative stress contributes to the etiology, pathogenesis, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa). Consequently dietary antioxidants, which inactivate reactive oxygen species and provide protection from oxidative damage, are considered important preventive agents against the development of PCa. However, the association between antioxidants and PCa has not been demonstrated consistently across epidemiological studies that took into account both dietary and supplement intake. The inconsistencies may result in part from failure to account for major sources of antioxidants in human diets that derive from many different chemical forms and confound this association. Dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC) is a new concept that enables one to estimate the sum of protective properties of dietary antioxidants against oxidative stress. Whether or not dietary TAC estimates correctly reflect in vivo antioxidant status and oxidative stress depends on the completeness and validity of dietary intake data that include accurate food composition data. Our recent studies indicate that dietary TAC levels of Caucasian Americans (CA) are higher than those of African Americans (AA). According to the U.S. Cancer Statistics for 2003-2007, the incidence rates of PCa are 50% higher for AA than CA, while mortality rates are 150% higher for AA. Factors proposed to explain this disparity include racial differences in PCa screening, access to care or care seeking behaviors, and etiologic and pathogenetic factors that influence PCa biology and aggressiveness. The racial disparity in PCa aggressiveness may be in part attributed to racial differences in antioxidant intake. However, limited information is available on the nutritional modulation of PCa aggressiveness. Thus, the objective of the proposed study is to determine the extent to which dietary TAC predicts PCa aggressiveness. The central hypothesis is that validation of a novel TAC tool will enable prediction of the risks of PCa mediated by oxidative stress. Our working hypothesis is that racial differences in PCa aggressiveness are in part the result of racial differences in antioxidant intake. To test the overall hypothesis, our specific aims are to: 1) determine the impact of dietary TAC on aggressiveness of newly diagnosed PCa; 2) determine whether dietary TAC level of PCa patients is associated with antioxidant-redox status in plasma, urinary, and PCa tissue samples; and 3) evaluate major dietary, sociodemographic, and lifestyle factors contributing to racial differences in dietary TAC of PCa patients by utilizing data on newl diagnosed PCa patients recruited through North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project. This project will provide important information on dietary TAC as a modifiable lifestyle factor among men diagnosed with PCa, and the extent to which it differs by race. Identification of dietary effects on PCa aggressiveness would suggest the importance of lifestyle behavioral factors in PCa outcome. Furthermore, the determination of racial differences in dietary behaviors may provide information that could be used to develop appropriate interventions to lower the risk of fatal PCa and reduce racial disparities in PCa mortality.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This pilot study aims to test the hypothesis that racial differences in prostate cancer aggressiveness are in part the result of racial differences in antioxidant intake by utilizing data of newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients recruited through the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project. The findings from this study can be used to develop appropriate interventions to lower the risk of fatal prostate cancer and reduce racial disparities in prostate cancer mortality.              This pilot study aims to test the hypothesis that racial differences in prostate cancer aggressiveness are in part the result of racial differences in antioxidant intake by utilizing data of newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients recruited through the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project.

"Signaling Pathway Alterations in the Racial Disparity of Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men have the highest rates of prostate cancer and the death rates due to prostate cancer are two times higher than Caucasians. The reason for the disparity is still unclear, but recent scientific studies suggest that the genetic and molecular changes in different ethnics are responsible for the disparity in African American men. These changes are responsible for different clinical outcome of prostate cancer in African American. Recent preliminary study showed that differences at molecular levels in prostate tissues between African American and Caucasian do exist. Therefore, we would like to further identify the molecules associated with prostate cancer racial disparity at the protein level using our novel Proteomic Pathway Array method, and to understand the mechanism of these molecules as a cause of the health disparity for prostate cancer among African American men. The success of the proposed study will have a profound benefit on the health of men, especially African Americans. The search for molecules that can distinguish those patients who will develop aggressive prostate cancer from those who will have a less aggressive course can help to identify patients who need more close surveillance and treatment. Furthermore, the identification and functional studies of molecules responsible for the aggressive behavior of prostate cancer in African American will help to design anti-cancer drugs and strategies. The translation from the discovery from this study to clinical application (diagnosis and treatment) can be achieved at a short period of time after completion of this study. The potential contributions ofthe study to advance health disparity research will be 1) identify biomarkers for prostate cancer racial disparity, 2) provide molecular bases why there is a racial difference in prostate cancer, 3) open a brand new way to look into the causes of racial difference in prostate cancer.

"Impact of Mitochondrial Genome Variation on extreme Prostate Cancer Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic etiology of prostate cancer, the most common cancer in western men, is poorly understood. Highest incidences and mortality rates are reported for African-Americans, with 1.6x more likely than European-Americans and 2.6x more likely than Asian-Americans to develop disease. This ethnic disparity and a strong link to a family history of disease, eludes to the importance of genetics in explaining the observed health disparity (including disease risk, aggression and outcomes). We report for the first time a highly significant increase in disease aggression in non-migrant Africa, compared with African-Americans and European-Americans, and hypothesize that a genetic link to Africa plays a fundamental role in unraveling the prostate cancer disparities. The mitochondrial genome is not only a critical target for inherited disparity (due to ethnic-based diversity, which is greatest wihin Africa), but is also an important target for acquired tumor-causing somatic mutations. Mitochondria play a central role not only in generating cellular energy, but also cell death (apoptosis), cell growth and differentiation, signaling and cell cycle control, making the mitochondrial genome an essential target for carcinogenic variation. The high mutation rate and copy number of the mitochondrial compared to the nuclear genome, further impacts on its unique potential for pathogenesis and as a disease marker. This project will provide the first known analysis of the role and extent of acquired mitochondrial genome variation (somatic mutations with functional predictive relevance) on a backbone of inherited variation (polymorphic variants) in defining the increased severity of prostate cancer within Africa. Using a unique study resource of non-admixed Southern African ancestry, combined with whole mitochondrial genome analysis using next generation sequencing technology, will provide an opportunity to identify genetic-based non- invasive biomarkers of aggressive versus indolent prostate cancer disease (a major clinical limitation in the management of prostate cancer), as well as the tools to detect low levels of somatic heteroplasmy (mutant to wild-type mtDNA environment) for early-disease detection and monitoring. This study addresses an important biological explanation for the observed ethnic- based disparities in prostate cancer.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ones genetics background has been speculated to be a key contributor to the observed disparity in prostate cancer risk and disease status, with increased severity in men of African ancestry compared with European and Asian men.

"Genomics and Predictive Modeling of Prostate Cancer Heath Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) men have an increased incidence and earlier age of onset of prostate cancer and two-fold higher rate of mortality from disease than Caucasian American (CA) men that does not correlate with socioeconomic status. Recent work in the PI's laboratory has shed light on the organization of the genomes of metastatic prostate cancers and primary prostate cancers from CA and AA men and has demonstrated that innate tumor characteristics may contribute to the observed health disparities. Compared to normal, non-cancerous genomes, the tumor genomes contain copy number alteration (CNA) gains or losses of genes that mediate initiation and progression. When matched for age, Gleason score and stage, the genomes of primary AA prostate cancers have a greater number of CNAs that predispose to metastasis compared to the genomes of CA prostate cancers. This study will validate the initial prostate cancer metastatic potential/health disparity study through somatic genomic DNA copy number analysis. A risk metric will be developed for each CNA that will be incorporated into a model that estimates the likelihood that a tumor will metastasize. The genetic predictors will be combined with clinical risk predictors to develop and evaluate a comprehensive statistical risk assessment model. Areas under the receiver-operator curves will be assessed to measure and compare the discriminatory accuracy. Paired analyses will be performed to demonstrate the presence of similar CNA profiles in biopsy and corresponding radical prostatectomy tumor specimens. In addition, whole genome sequencing will be applied to AA and CA tumors of different characteristics - primaries of different metastatic potential and metastases. These will be analyzed for mutations, duplications, and deletions that may have had a causal role.          This project is built on a study that identified innate genomic differences of AA and CA prostate cancers through a novel application of natural selection theory. The research of tumor biology will translate into a risk model for determining whether prostate cancers should be treated aggressively or with watchful waiting.

"Mitochondrial Genetics in Prostate Cancer Health Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a dramatic and unexplained racial/ethnic disparity in prostate cancer in the US. African Americans (AA) are 1.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 2.4 times more likely to die from prostate cancer than Caucasian Americans (CA). While it is likely that multiple factors account for this disparity, genetic predisposition may account for a substantial proportion. We have discovered that inherited mutations in the mitochondrial genome are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer and that AA males have very different mutations in this genome than CA and that AA men have significantly greater rates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations than CA. The overall hypothesis we will test is that race-specific missense mtDNA mutations that are found in the germ line of AA and CA men with prostate cancer alter mitochondrial biology so as to enhance prostate cancer growth and survival. Because of our ongoing 10-year prospective specimen banking protocol we have biologic specimens (including peripheral blood DNA) and clinical data on over 1000 men that have undergone radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer at Emory University Hospital. Because of technical advances in mtDNA sequencing, the entire mitochondrial genome (~16.5 kb) can be rapidly and reliably sequenced by chip based methods. We are therefore uniquely positioned to rapidly perform sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome in AA and CA men with prostate cancer and propose sequencing 50 men from each racial group and comparing the mtDNA mutations. All individuals with missense mutations will be contacted for further phlebotomy and the establishment of lymphoblast cell lines that will allow us to ""capture"" these mtDNA mutations and generate prostate cancer cell lines with prostate cancer relevant mtDNA mutations. Each mutation will be paired with an appropriate control cell line that differs by a single mtDNA base change. These mutant/control pairs will then undergo analysis of respiratory complex activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation thereby allowing us to assign functionality of the observed mutations. We will also test antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents for their ability to reverse the cell biologic derangements caused by the prostate cancer specific mtDNA mutations. If successful, these studies will define the functionality of mtDNA mutations in prostate cancer, the role they play in the racial disparity of prostate cancer, and begin to determine treatments that may be particularly effective in preventing mtDNA mutation induced cancer predisposition allowing mutation-specific treatments to be selected. The potential impact is far reaching because mitochondrial variation has now been identified as an important feature of cancer, heart disease, neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes and optic neuropathy, all associated with mitochondrial mutations.        This project will study racial differences (health disparities) in prostate cancer genetics. Specifically, we will determine all mutations in the mitochondrial DNA in a group of African American and Caucasian American men with prostate cancer. Once mutations are identified they will be studied in the laboratory to determine how they exert their effects on cancer and what anti-cancer drugs might be used to treat patients with these mitochondrial DNA mutations. The ultimate use of this research is both to understand the basic abnormalities that account for racial differences in prostate cancer and to identify mutation-specific treatments.

"Mitochondrial DNA and Prostate Cancer in African American     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mitochondria play a central role in cell proliferation, cell signaling and apoptosis. Mitochondria contain their own DNA (mtDNA). mtDNA serves as a determinant of human origin and ethnicity. Human mtDNA is a very small (16,569 bp) genome. The entire protein coding capacity of the mitochondrial genome is dedicated to the production of 13 protein subunits. These 13 proteins constitute various subunits that make up four oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes essential for energy (ATP) production and other mitochondrial function. African-American men (AAM) have the highest rate of prostate cancer, develop prostate cancer at an early age, present with a higher tumor grade at time of diagnosis, and have a higher rate of metastasis and mortality than Caucasian American men (CAM). The genetic mechanism(s) underlying this racial diversity in prostate cancer is not well understood. Our studies demonstrate that in AAM reduced mtDNA content plays an important role in prostate carcinogenesis. We measured the mtDNA copy number in white blood cells (WBC) and prostate tumor obtained from AAM and CAM. Our preliminary studies suggest that WBC of both AAM and CAM contained similar amount of mtDNA (copy number). However, when adjusted for age, Gleason grade and PSA (prostate specific antigen) the prostate tumors of AAM contained >6 times less mtDNA than CAM tumors. Our preliminary data suggest that mutations in nuclear gene encoding mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG1) induce depletion of mtDNA and increase tumorigenic potential of cancer cells in vitro. These studies suggest that mtDNA homeostasis must play an important role in carcinogenesis. Based on these observations we hypothesize that reduced mtDNA content plays a critical role in prostate tumorigenesis in AAM by significantly altering the mitochondrial OXPHOS. AIM 1: Determine whether mutational spectrum of POLG1 in AAM prostate tumors differs from POLG1 mutational spectrum of CAM. Identify distinctive mutations in POLG1 gene in primary prostate tumors of AAM and determine its functional significance on mtDNA depletion, OXPHOS activity and apoptosis. AIM 2: Determine the consequences of mutant POLG1 induced depletion of mtDNA on prostate tumorigenesis in vitro and in mouse xenograft model. The proposed development of mtDNA depletion in prostate cells has the significant potential to enhance our understanding of prostate tumorigenesis in the African American population. This proposal addresses the two key objectives of the PAR-09-160 requesting exploratory grants in basic cancer research in cancer health disparities (R21). These objectives include: 1) the development of ""new cell culture models/systems designed to investigate cancer disparities"" and 2) explores the susceptibility to prostate cancer in African-American men due to ""genetic differences"" in mtDNA content.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  African-American men (AAM) have the highest rate of prostate cancer, develop prostate cancer at an early age, present with a higher tumor grade at time of diagnosis, and have a higher rate of metastasis and mortality than European American men (EAM) (Powell 2007; Williams and Powell 2009). The genetic mechanism(s) underlying this racial diversity in prostate cancer is not well understood (Guo et al 2000). The proposed study will help determine how reduced mtDNA content found in African American men plays an important role in prostate tumorigenicity.            ",Mitochondrial DNA and Prostate Cancer in African American,8494189,R21CA176054,"['Age ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' mtDNA ', ' Mitochondrial DNA ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Grant ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Oxidative Phosphorylation Pathway ', ' ATP biosynthesis (oxidative) ', ' Oxidative Phosphorylation ', ' Play ', ' chromosome complement ', ' DNA Ploidy ', ' DNA Index ', ' DNA Content ', ' Ploidies ', ' Production ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' European ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Genetic ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Complex ', ' Nuclear ', ' DNA polymerase gamma ', ' American ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' mutant ', ' Protein Subunits ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Address ', ' Basic Cancer Research ', ' Data ', ' Tumorigenicity ', ' Xenograft Model ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' mitochondrial genome ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' tumorigenic ', ' Population ', ' DNA copy number ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' prostate tumorigenesis ', ' prostate carcinogenesis ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2013,191183,0.32719929769815037
"Systematic Genetic Characterization of African American Prostate Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United Sates, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and African- American men have long been known to exhibit a higher incidence and increased mortality compared to men of other ethnic groups. Although socioeconomic factors and unequal access to health care undoubtedly contribute to this disparity, differences in incidence and outcome persist after adjusting for these factors. Thus, tumor biological and/or genetic aspects may underpin adverse outcomes in African-American prostate cancer. To date, however, few studies have queried the molecular biology or somatic genetics of African-American prostate cancer in-depth, meaning that our understanding of the spectrum of factors influencing these disparities remains incomplete. The over-arching goal of this proposal is to undertake a definitive somatic genetic and functional characterization of African-American prostate cancer. To accomplish this goal, we will develop a targeted, massively parallel sequencing platform that interrogates the spectrum of recurrent alterations (base mutations, chromosomal copy number changes, and selected chromosomal rearrangements) relevant to prostate cancer. We will utilize this platform to perform tumor mutation profiling in a cohort of two hundred prostate tumor specimens obtained from African American men, leveraging knowledge from prostate cancer genome sequencing studies currently ongoing at the Broad Institute and elsewhere. Patterns of somatic alterations observed in this cohort will be compared to those of European-American prostate cancer. In addition, we will test top candidate genes affected by recurrently altered prostate cancer genomic loci for effects on the tumorigenic phenotype in primary prostate epithelial cells obtained from men of European or African descent. Once completed, this project should provide decisive insights into the spectrum of and functional relevance of somatic genetic alterations in African-American prostate cancer, thereby affirming or refuting the hypothesis that these biological factors undergird this pervasive cancer health disparity.          Prostate cancer in African-American men occurs more frequently, earlier in life, and with increased lethality when compared to European Americans. Undoubtedly, the genesis of this profound disparity is multi-factorial; however, a detailed study of the genetics and biology of African-American prostate cancer has not previously been undertaken. The focus of this grant is a systematic study of recurrent somatic genetic alterations in African-American prostate cancer using targeted, massively parallel sequencing. In addition, we will query specific cancer alterations in cell culture models derived from African-American and European-American patients. Upon completion, this study will likely constitute one of the most comprehensive functional genetic efforts yet undertaken in African-American prostate cancer. Insights from this study may inform new treatment strategies that prove broadly relevant across diverse human populations.

"Basic Cancer Research in Cancer Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common lethal tumor among US males yet little is known about its causative mechanisms. This study proposes to examine how glycosylation of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) affects steroid hormone signaling in prostate cancer. We will define the impact of SHBG glycosylation, including the D327N SHBG polymorphism, on steroid hormone associated prostate cancer risk and disparity in African and Caucasian Americans. Protein glycosylation is critical for interaction of prostate cells with its environment. We will evaluate how glycosylation of SHBG affect the distribution of the protein between plasma and tissue and how this affects disease development. The quantification of the SHBG glycoforms will be achieved by novel LC-MS assays. In addition, we will comprehensively summarize the impact of polymorphisms on N-glycosylation in the human proteome. Our hypothesis is that prostate cancer risk and progression are related to the variability in the glycosylation of SHBG. Our objective is to perform quantitative mass spectrometric assays of SHBG glycosylation in conjunction with measurement of steroid hormones. We will select men for phenotypic characterization by genotyping of a case control population with 50% African American representation. In addition, we will genotype a case series for which both serum and tissue are available. Steroid hormones will be measured by GC-MS. We will analyze the SHBG glycoforms and steroid hormones at the tissue level and in the circulation. The study is expected to fill important gaps in our understanding of prostate cancer etiology and progression. The analysis of SHBG glycoforms will provide new information on the biological factors underlying prostate carcinogenesis. The results are expected to improve prostate cancer prevention, detection and intervention strategies.            This research is important because a comparative analysis of SHBG glycosylation and steroid hormones in prostate cancer, especially in African American men, has not been previously undertaken. We are proposing the first large scale examination of SHBG site occupancy in prostate cancer and health disparity of the disease. The newly established informatic resources and methods are expected to stimulate novel cancer prevention and health disparity studies.

"CNTR OF EXCELLENCE FOR PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH EDUCATION AND COMM SERVICE The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) was established in 1999 at Clark  Atlanta University to carry-out basic research in cancer biology and drug discovery. In 2004, the CCRTD  decided to concentrate in the area of prostate cancer due to disproportionately higher incidence and  mortality rate of this disease in African-American men. The current proposal requests support to continue the  Center of Excellence in Prostate Cancer Research, Education and Community Education. The main  objectives of this center will be 1) To carry out high quality basic research in cell and molecular biology of  prostate cancer and to identify underlying biological reasons for racial disparities, 2) To continue our training  program for undergraduate and graduate students to provide research training in the area of prostate cancer  and hence increase the number of minority (primarily African American) scientists in this area of research, 3)  To expand the community-based educational program for raising awareness on prevention, screening, early  detection and treatment of prostate cancer. These goals will be achieved in collaboration with the Clark  Atlanta University Division of Communication Arts, Midtown Urology Educational Foundation, Saint Joseph's  Hospital Men's Health and Wellness Center, and other community organizations. In the Research Core, we  propose three research projects focusing on prostate cancer cell and molecular biology and racial disparities.  In the Training Core, we are requesting support for training of four graduate and six undergraduate students  in the area of cancer biology and community service. In the Community Outreach/Education Core, we are  requesting support to expand upon the community outreach and educational activities to include a larger  media arena and coverage. The overall activities of the center will be monitored by the Administrative Core.  The activities of the Administrative Core will be overseen by the Institutional (lAC), External (EAC) and Local  External (LEAC) Advisory Committees. The long term goals of the center will be to understand the biology of  prostate cancer, to increase the number of African-American scientists in cancer research, and to educate  the African-American community in the areas of prostate cancer prevention, early detection and treatment. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Prostate cancer affects the African-American community disproportionately.

"Signaling Pathway Alterations in the Racial Disparity of Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men have the highest rates of prostate cancer and the death rates due to prostate cancer are two times higher than Caucasians. The reason for the disparity is still unclear, but recent scientific studies suggest that the genetic and molecular changes in different ethnics are responsible for the disparity in African American men. These changes are responsible for different clinical outcome of prostate cancer in African American. Recent preliminary study showed that differences at molecular levels in prostate tissues between African American and Caucasian do exist. Therefore, we would like to further identify the molecules associated with prostate cancer racial disparity at the protein level using our novel Proteomic Pathway Array method, and to understand the mechanism of these molecules as a cause of the health disparity for prostate cancer among African American men. The success of the proposed study will have a profound benefit on the health of men, especially African Americans. The search for molecules that can distinguish those patients who will develop aggressive prostate cancer from those who will have a less aggressive course can help to identify patients who need more close surveillance and treatment. Furthermore, the identification and functional studies of molecules responsible for the aggressive behavior of prostate cancer in African American will help to design anti-cancer drugs and strategies. The translation from the discovery from this study to clinical application (diagnosis and treatment) can be achieved at a short period of time after completion of this study. The potential contributions ofthe study to advance health disparity research will be 1) identify biomarkers for prostate cancer racial disparity, 2) provide molecular bases why there is a racial difference in prostate cancer, 3) open a brand new way to look into the causes of racial difference in prostate cancer.          This study will lead to discovery of novel signal transduction proteins involved in racial disparity of prostate cancer and will generate clinically relevant information for developing biomarkers for early detection of aggressive prostate  cancer in the African American community. The functional study of these signal transduction proteins in the context  of racial disparity may lead to development of novel treatment strategy for prostate cancer according to ethnic  background.

"A Network Analytic Approach to Modeling Variation in Prostate Cancer Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unexplained variation in the clinical management of prostate cancer is recognized as an important problem in cancer treatment. To investigate potential explanations for this variation, the proposed project uses a social network analytic approach to model the connections that exist between physicians caring for patients with prostate cancer. This approach explicitly recognizes the clinical reality that many patients face: they see multiple physicians for their screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care across a range of clinical venues and at various times. Not only does each physician contribute to the type and quality of care patients receive but also the relationships between physicians within a geographical region may be an important and modifiable determinant of care. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to map the connections between PCPs, urologists, and radiation oncologists as a network and examine whether specialists' positions in the network structure are related to their patient's prostate cancer treatment; (2) to determine whether the network structure helps explain observed differences in prostate cancer treatment between black and white men; and (3) to investigate the determinants of the network structure through a survey of PCPs about their referral decisions. To achieve these aims, this project uses SEER-Medicare claims data and a survey of PCPs. The SEER- Medicare sample consists of men with localized prostate cancer diagnosed from 1995-2005 and their associated PCP and specialist providers. The position of specialists in the cancer care networks will be quantitatively determined and the positions will be related to patient-level variation in the type and quality of cancer care and to racial differences in care. The survey of PCPs will elucidate the factors important in their referral decisions. Understanding observed variations may suggest ways that the network structure may be leveraged to improve quality in cancer care and reduce disparities in outcomes. The candidate, Craig Pollack, MD, MHS is an Assistant Professor in the Division of General Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine with a joint appointment in the Department of Epidemiology and membership in the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. His long-term goal is to become an independent, grant-funded health services researcher in the field of cancer control. His short-term goals are to develop expertise in cancer prevention and control, network analysis, advanced health services research methods, and organizational theory and provider behavior. Dr. Pollack has assembled a mentoring team that includes national leaders in cancer research, urological cancer, health disparities, and network analysis.

"Financial well-being following prostate cancer diagnosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer research has consistently shown evidence of racial/ethnic disparities across the cancer  continuum from detection/screening and treatment-related outcomes to mortality; and socioeconomic status  (SES) has been suggested as a substantial factor in the racial differences; yet, the research results for SES  disparities i prostate cancer-related outcomes as well as SES as an explanatory factor in racial/ethnic  disparities in prostate cancer have been inconsistent. Some have suggested that this inconsistency may be due to imprecise (and inconsistent or incomplete) measurement of socioeconomic circumstances.   Thus, there have been calls in the cancer disparities literature for greater clarity on the pathways and mechanisms causing differential cancer outcomes across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the conceptualization AND operationalization of socioeconomic circumstances in this literature.  An expanded view of the socioeconomic context for prostate cancer patients might uncover socioeconomic factors influencing disparities in treatment-related outcomes over and above the traditional SES measures; and a construct to capture this expanded socioeconomic context is financial well-being (FWB).  The  specific aims of the research project are to:  1) Develop and refine a conceptual model of the multidimensional  construct FWB using structured interviews with prostate cancer patients and a focus group with clinical social  workers; 2) Develop and pilot test a measure of FWB; 3) Evaluate the psychometric properties of the measure  of FWB and investigate the association between components of FWB, socio-demographic characteristics, and  treatment selection and adherence and perceived quality of treatment; and 4) Investigate differences in  responses to FWB items across racial/ethnic groups and evaluate potential measurement bias across  racial/ethnic groups. The successful completion of the research project will result in a valid measurement and causal model of FWB that articulates how the dimensions of FWB are related to prostate cancer treatment-related outcomes.  The candidate, Dr. Reginald Tucker-Seeley, is a Research Associate in the Center for Community Based Research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The proposed five year NCI Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) will provide the necessary mentoring, training, and research experiences in cancer care/health services, psycho-oncology, and measures/scale development to implement the proposed research project.  His long term career goal is to become an independent investigator developing projects to reduce socioeconomic disparities across the cancer continuum from prevention to end-of-life care.   Through this work, he plans to identify the socioeconomic pathways contributing to cancer disparities and to design innovate interventions that help individuals better manage and leverage their socioeconomic and psychosocial resources for improved health.               A more comprehensive view of socioeconomic status (SES) may help us better understand how SES is actually experienced and how it affects prostate cancer treatment and outcomes.  Our limited knowledge about both the subjective and objective mechanisms through which socioeconomic experience impacts cancer treatment constrains our understanding of the factors that contribute to cancer disparities.  Expanding our conceptualization of SES to include material and psychosocial aspects of individual socioeconomic circumstances may help us begin to unpack the complex association between socioeconomic circumstances and the various types of prostate cancer treatment selected and adherence to treatment.

"Pten-loss Dysregulated Pathways in Prostate Cancer  Pten-loss Dysregulated Pathways in Prostate Cancer Summary Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths (after lung cancer) in American men, and the morbidity and the mortality to PCa are even higher in African American men as compared Caucasians. Molecular mechanisms leading to the initiation and progression of PCa including castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or androgen insensitive prostate cancer (AI-PC) are poorly understood. PTEN and p53 are the two most frequently deleted and/ or mutated genes in a variety of human cancers including advanced PCa. Loss of PTEN leads to the hyperactivation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) and serine/Thr kinase (Akt/PKB). Pten-deficient mice develop high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and invasive adenocarcinoma. We have recently demonstrated in our mouse model that the acute inactivation of Pten unexpectedly elicits cellular senescence, a novel mechanism suppressing cancer progression. Aberrant regulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors including p19Arf, p53 and p21 proteins have been observed in prostate tumors of Pten-deficient mice. We HYPOTHESIZE that aberrant activation of p19Arf-p53 pathways cooperates with Pten loss to result in prostate cancer progression. We propose to test this hypothesis and to study the molecular mechanisms of regulating Pten-p19Arf-p53 network in prostate cancer using mouse models and cell lines with following Specific Aims: 1. to define the role of p19Arf in prostate cancer progression. 2. to determine the functional roles of p19Arf in the crosstalk of Pten and p53 during tumorigenesis. 3. to address the consequence and relevance of p19Arf inactivation in CRPC growth using Pten/p53 mouse model. Results obtained from this award will provide us valuable insights into novel roles of ARF in prostate cancer progression.  Project Narrative The goal of this project is to elucidate Pten-loss dysregulated pathways in prostate cancer (PCa) by defining novel roles of p19Arf in prostate cancer progression including castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) growth.

"METABOLOMIC PROFILING AND BIOLOGIC BASIS OF RACIAL DISPARITY IN PROSTATE CANCER     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of our research plan is to reduce the disproportionate effects of prostate cancer on African American men. A guiding principle of our methodology is biochemical differences exist between prostate cancers of African American and European American origin and that these differences can explain, in part, prostate cancer health disparity. In this application, we propose to use the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover these underlying differences. Metabolomics describes the science of quantifying the levels of metabolites (e.g., small molecules) that are the byproducts of cellular metabolism. That is to say, in this kind of analysis we are measuring the biochemical entities (or metabolites) that are produced by the functional machinery of the cell. With knowledge of the identity of specific metabolites we can infer the biological processes that produced them, thus gaining insight into a cell's metabolism. To date, a metabolomic analysis of prostate cancer health disparity has not been reported. In preliminary studies, we have profiled the metabolome of prostate cancers from African-American and European American men and have identified specific racially distinct metabololites as well as biological pathways associated with each. In this proposal, we will i) validate and refine the metabolomic profile of prostate cancers from African American and European American men, ii) evaluate the role of specific biochemical pathways in prostate cancers of African American and European American men and iii) develop urine based metabolic markers for high risk prostate cancer in African American and European American men. At the conclusion of this study, we will have developed a racially derived metabolomic model for prostate cancer as well as identified candidate pathways for future drug targeting.            At present, it is not known how the prostate cancer metabolome contributes to health disparities. The information gleaned from this proposal could rapidly revolutionize current diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches by revealing the biological underpinnings of prostate cancer health disparity.

"Community-Based Research to Improve Prostate Cancer Patient Treatment Decisions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians recognize the need for and support informed decision making as a mechanism for helping men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer and are considering treatment. Men need help to reduce decisional regret, reduce decisional conflict, improve satisfaction with their treatment decisions and develop a plan for coping with the sequelae of quality-of-life compromising side effects. A variety of factors interact at multiple socio-ecologic levels to facilitate or prevent informed decision making from occurring. The manner in which culture influences prostate cancer treatment decision-making among African Americans remains understudied. Research from other health contexts strongly suggests that participatory action research can be helpful in generating new culturally appropriate knowledge to apply to this problem. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that interventions developed using participatory research approaches are effective for improving informed treatment decision making for prostate cancer with African-American men. The purpose of the current Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) grant application is to provide the applicant, a newly appointed assistant professor of oncology at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI), with appropriate training and research experience that will enable him to function as an independent investigator building a research program in disparities and prostate cancer. Support provided by this training grant will provide Dr. Ross with sufficient release time (75%) to complete a career development plan that consists of carefully selected didactic coursework, individualized instruction, seminars, and research experiences grounded in applied ethnographic and community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. The aims of Dr. Ross' proposed research are (1) to formalize and strengthen a community-research partnership between a group of prostate cancer advocates and the Office of Cancer Health Disparities Research at Roswell Park Cancer Institute that will guide community driven cancer educational initiatives; (2) to conduct ethnographic research with African-American men and their significant others to provide a holistic, contextualized description of their experiences with prostate cancer treatment; and (3) to use a participatory research approach to create a culturally appropriate treatment decision-making intervention for African- American men and their significant others. The proposed training and experience in ethnography and CBPR will yield rich insights into prostate cancer education for hard-to-reach, high risk populations. It will also contribute vital information to the fields of health education and behavior to enhance cancer control.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public health and medical professionals struggle with helping African-American men make informed choices for prostate cancer treatment. This research will advance understanding of what is needed to develop culturally appropriate supports to assist African-American men and their significant others with this all important process.

"Addressing Prostate Cancer Information Disparities with eHealth Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (CaP) is a prevalent and serious disease with no known methods of primary prevention. African American (AA) men are disproportionately affected by CaP; they are 60% more likely to be diagnosed and nearly 2.5 times more likely to die from the disease than White men. Screening with prostate specific antigen (PSA) is the main method of early detection, although it remains of unproven benefit. Major medical organizations debate the potential benefits versus harms of prostate cancer screening (PCS), but they all emphasize educating men about the potential limitations, risks and benefits of PCS, and helping them to make individualized decisions with their medical providers (""shared decision-making,"" or SDM). Nonetheless, this is not the norm in clinical practice, especially for AA men. Numerous decision aids (DAs) have been developed to help men make informed decisions regarding PCS. Unlike most prior PCS studies, however, we have developed a culturally relevant DA; make use of low cost, modern technologies to deliver the multi-media, individually tailored DA; gather data from patients and providers to study the dyad; and assess the potential for integration of PCSPrep into clinical practice. We address these research gaps by testing the Prostate Cancer Screening Preparation (PCSPrep) -- a tailored, interactive, Web-based, and culturally relevant DA -- on outcomes related to SDM among AA men. Primary care providers (PCP) affiliated with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center will be recruited. From each PCP, we will recruit and enroll 10 AA men ages 45-70 (N=100). Study participants will complete a pre-test, PCSPrep, and post-test immediately prior to a routine medical visit. PCS discussions between patient and provider will be audio-taped and both patients and providers will complete assessments immediately after the visit. Specific aims are to estimate the impact of PCSPrep on: (1) patients' PCS knowledge, decision self-efficacy, and decisional consistency; (2) providers' perceptions of patient engagement, concordance between provider/patient ratings of SDM; and (3) feasibility and acceptability of integrating PCSPrep         into primary care practice. The ultimate goal is to reduce disparities in access to high quality information about PCS and to empower AA men to be active participants in their care. Results will not only inform decision-making for PCS, but can inform the development of interventions for other conditions or procedures that call for SDM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is significant because it is expected to lead to the expansion of eHealth technology to assist men making complex medical decisions with their providers about a screening test for which there is uncertain efficacy. As a result of this project we will have a culturally relevant, multi-media, individually tailored DA that will prepare men to take part in SDM about PCS.  Moreover, we will have preliminary information about the impact of provider discussions on men's PCS preferences and the extent to which patients and providers view the same clinical encounter differently. This will ultimately lead to multi-level interventions directed at patients, providers and health systems to improve patient-centered decision-making.              ",Addressing Prostate Cancer Information Disparities with eHealth Technology,8568348,R21CA178296,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Israel ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Funding ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' tool ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' Medical center ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' outreach to information ', ' Access to Information ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Update ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Network-based ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R21,2013,241423,0.1830184458649449
"Genome-wide sequencing of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men have two times or more the incidence rate of prostate cancer than other U.S. populations, and high rates of prostate cancer are also seen in other African and African-derived populations. It is generally accepted that both common and rare genetic variants contribute to risk of complex diseases such as prostate cancer, however their relative contributions to overall heritability is a subject of intense controversy. For rare variants to have a significant influence on the risk of complex disease the spectrum of effect sizes must be considerably larger in magnitude than for common variants; to date however there is only limited evidence for or against this hypothesis since the means of comprehensively testing rare variation in the genome has not been possible until very recently. In this proposal we seek to test the contributions of both common and rare genetic variants to the risk of prostate cancer in men of American ancestry using a targeted genome-wide association study approach. In Aim 1 we plan to sequence (at 30x coverage) the exome and regulatory regions (~160 Mb) of the genome, as defined by epigenetic marks in prostate cancer cell lines, in 1,000 men of African ancestry (500 with aggressive disease) and 1,000 controls. Both single SNP and burden of rare variants analyses will be performed and replication testing of the most statistically significant sequence variations (~24,000) will be examined in additional samples of African ancestry (6,000 cases and 6,000 controls) through the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer (AAPC) consortium. In addition to association testing of single variants, we will conduct ""burden of rare variants analyses"" of coding and non-coding variants at the gene and pathway level. In Aim 2, we will examine interactions between associated variants, environmental factors (thereby better defining the role of these factors) and disease severity. In Aim 3, we will assess biological function of the novel risk alleles identified in Aim 1 using a staged approach of eQTL analysis followed by in vitro analyses of enhancer activity as well as allele-specific effects. This proposal spans the spectrum of genetic epidemiologic research in prostate cancer, from genetic discovery (for all prostate cancer as well as aggressive disease) to gene environment interaction testing, to biological understanding. We expect this work to significantly advance knowledge of the etiology of prostate cancer and racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer risk, and to guide the development of future preventive, early detection, prognostic and even therapeutic measures.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, we will conduct targeted genome-wide sequencing in men of African ancestry to reveal genetic markers that may contribute to their greater risk of prostate cancer. We expect findings from this study will make a major contribution to our understanding of genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer and the genetic basis underlying familial aggregation and heritability of this common cancer. Identifying more genetic predictors of risk will have widespread applicability and significance, leading to better risk models to more accurately predict a man's risk of developing prostate cancer, and better intensive screening and preventive strategies that target men at high risk.                    ",Genome-wide sequencing of prostate cancer in men of African

"Does Dietary Antioxidant Predict Aggressiveness of Prostate Cancer?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Considerable evidence suggests that oxidative stress contributes to the etiology, pathogenesis, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa). Consequently dietary antioxidants, which inactivate reactive oxygen species and provide protection from oxidative damage, are considered important preventive agents against the development of PCa. However, the association between antioxidants and PCa has not been demonstrated consistently across epidemiological studies that took into account both dietary and supplement intake. The inconsistencies may result in part from failure to account for major sources of antioxidants in human diets that derive from many different chemical forms and confound this association. Dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC) is a new concept that enables one to estimate the sum of protective properties of dietary antioxidants against oxidative stress. Whether or not dietary TAC estimates correctly reflect in vivo antioxidant status and oxidative stress depends on the completeness and validity of dietary intake data that include accurate food composition data. Our recent studies indicate that dietary TAC levels of Caucasian Americans (CA) are higher than those of African Americans (AA). According to the U.S. Cancer Statistics for 2003-2007, the incidence rates of PCa are 50% higher for AA than CA, while mortality rates are 150% higher for AA. Factors proposed to explain this disparity include racial differences in PCa screening, access to care or care seeking behaviors, and etiologic and pathogenetic factors that influence PCa biology and aggressiveness. The racial disparity in PCa aggressiveness may be in part attributed to racial differences in antioxidant intake. However, limited information is available on the nutritional modulation of PCa aggressiveness. Thus, the objective of the proposed study is to determine the extent to which dietary TAC predicts PCa aggressiveness. The central hypothesis is that validation of a novel TAC tool will enable prediction of the risks of PCa mediated by oxidative stress. Our working hypothesis is that racial differences in PCa aggressiveness are in part the result of racial differences in antioxidant intake. To test the overall hypothesis, our specific aims are to: 1) determine the impact of dietary TAC on aggressiveness of newly diagnosed PCa; 2) determine whether dietary TAC level of PCa patients is associated with antioxidant-redox status in plasma, urinary, and PCa tissue samples; and 3) evaluate major dietary, sociodemographic, and lifestyle factors contributing to racial differences in dietary TAC of PCa patients by utilizing data on newl diagnosed PCa patients recruited through North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project. This project will provide important information on dietary TAC as a modifiable lifestyle factor among men diagnosed with PCa, and the extent to which it differs by race. Identification of dietary effects on PCa aggressiveness would suggest the importance of lifestyle behavioral factors in PCa outcome. Furthermore, the determination of racial differences in dietary behaviors may provide information that could be used to develop appropriate interventions to lower the risk of fatal PCa and reduce racial disparities in PCa mortality.          This pilot study aims to test the hypothesis that racial differences in prostate cancer aggressiveness are in part the result of racial differences in antioxidant intake by utilizing data of newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients recruited through the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project. The findings from this study can be used to develop appropriate interventions to lower the risk of fatal prostate cancer and reduce racial disparities in prostate cancer mortality.

"Genomics and Predictive Modeling of Prostate Cancer Heath Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) men have an increased incidence and earlier age of onset of prostate cancer and two-fold higher rate of mortality from disease than Caucasian American (CA) men that does not correlate with socioeconomic status. Recent work in the PI's laboratory has shed light on the organization of the genomes of metastatic prostate cancers and primary prostate cancers from CA and AA men and has demonstrated that innate tumor characteristics may contribute to the observed health disparities. Compared to normal, non-cancerous genomes, the tumor genomes contain copy number alteration (CNA) gains or losses of genes that mediate initiation and progression. When matched for age, Gleason score and stage, the genomes of primary AA prostate cancers have a greater number of CNAs that predispose to metastasis compared to the genomes of CA prostate cancers. This study will validate the initial prostate cancer metastatic potential/health disparity study through somatic genomic DNA copy number analysis. A risk metric will be developed for each CNA that will be incorporated into a model that estimates the likelihood that a tumor will metastasize. The genetic predictors will be combined with clinical risk predictors to develop and evaluate a comprehensive statistical risk assessment model. Areas under the receiver-operator curves will be assessed to measure and compare the discriminatory accuracy. Paired analyses will be performed to demonstrate the presence of similar CNA profiles in biopsy and corresponding radical prostatectomy tumor specimens. In addition, whole genome sequencing will be applied to AA and CA tumors of different characteristics - primaries of different metastatic potential and metastases. These will be analyzed for mutations, duplications, and deletions that may have had a causal role.          This project is built on a study that identified innate genomic differences of AA and CA prostate cancers through a novel application of natural selection theory. The research of tumor biology will translate into a risk model for determining whether prostate cancers should be treated aggressively or with watchful waiting. The metastasis-promoting genes identified could become targets for new therapies.

"Circadian Genes and Aggressive Prostate Cancer in Caucasians and African American     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality rates for prostate cancer in the world and are more than twice as likely to die of prostate cancer as their Caucasian counterparts. Reasons for this racial disparity are unknown. Recently, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified circadian rhythm disruption as a probable cause of cancer based on epidemiologic data suggesting that shift work involving circadian disruptions may be associated with higher risk of cancers, including that of the prostate. Within the body, circadian rhythms are controlled by 15 known circadian-related genes. Variations in these genes have been shown to influence androgen metabolism and energy balance, which are thought to contribute to the development of prostate cancer. It has also been shown that haplotype patterns in one of the circadian genes differ significantly between Africans and non-Africans. We hypothesize that variation in circadian genes affects the risk of prostate cancer, in particular aggressive prostate cancer, in both Caucasians and African Americans, and that the relationship between circadian gene variants and aggressive prostate cancer risk may differ between the two ethnic groups, thereby contributing to the disparity of aggressive prostate cancer in these two groups. To test these hypotheses, we are collaborating with the African American Prostate Cancer (AAPC) Genetic Consortium and the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) in using existing genetic data (2,700 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 15 genes) from these two consortium studies (4,000 aggressive prostate cancer cases and 9,500 controls) for a comprehensive statistical analysis. Of the 13,500 subjects included in the study, about 1,200 cases and 5,000 healthy controls are African American men from the AAPC study and 2,800 cases and 4,500 healthy controls are Caucasian men from the BPC3 study. We plan to conduct statistical analyses to: 1) determine if variation in circadian genes are associated with risk of aggressive prostate cancer in Caucasians and African Americans; and 2) determine whether the association between circadian gene variants and prostate cancer risk differs between Caucasians and African Americans and whether this difference explains part of the racial disparity in prostate cancer risk. This is the first study t have a large number of aggressive prostate cancer cases, especially from African Americans, with extensive SNP coverage of circadian genes. This study is therefore able to provide insight into the role of circadian genes in prostate cancer and whether these genes contribute to the racial disparity of prostate cancer rates between Caucasians and African Americans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans have the highest prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates in the world. They are also more than twice as likely to die of prostate cancer as their Caucasian counterparts.

A guiding principle of our methodology is biochemical differences exist between prostate cancers of African American and European American origin and that these differences can explain, in part, prostate cancer health disparity. In this application, we propose to use the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover these underlying differences. Metabolomics describes the science of quantifying the levels of metabolites (e.g., small molecules) that are the byproducts of cellular metabolism. That is to say, in this kind of analysis we are measuring the biochemical entities (or metabolites) that are produced by the functional machinery of the cell. With knowledge of the identity of specific metabolites we can infer the biological processes that produced them, thus gaining insight into a cell's metabolism. To date, a metabolomic analysis of prostate cancer health disparity has not been reported. In preliminary studies, we have profiled the metabolome of prostate cancers from African-American and European American men and have identified specific racially distinct metabololites as well as biological pathways associated with each. In this proposal, we will i) validate and refine the metabolomic profile of prostate cancers from African American and European American men, ii) evaluate the role of specific biochemical pathways in prostate cancers of African American and European American men and iii) develop urine based metabolic markers for high risk prostate cancer in African American and European American men. At the conclusion of this study, we will have developed a racially derived metabolomic model for prostate cancer as well as identified candidate pathways for future drug targeting.            At present, it is not known how the prostate cancer metabolome contributes to health disparities. The information gleaned from this proposal could rapidly revolutionize current diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches by revealing the biological underpinnings of prostate cancer health disparity.

"Biological and Environmental modifiers of Vitamin D3 and Prostate Cancer Risk  ABSTRACT Disparities in prostate cancer (Pca) are caused by complex interactions of genetic susceptibility, individual risk factors, and environmental factors. Pca is the second leading cause of death among all men; however African American (AA) men have the highest mortality rate of Pca of any racial/ethnic group in the U.S. This difference in mortality accounts for 44% of the overall cancer mortality disparity between AA and European-American (EA) men. Thus, there is a critical need to explore the etiologic pathways that contribute to this disparity. Unfortunately, the only well-established risk factors (age, race and family history) for Pca are non-modifiable. However recent studies have found low levels of vitamin D have been associated with increased Pca risk, and treatment with vitamin D has reduced Pca disease progression in multiple studies. These studies support the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of Pca and that vitamin D is a potential chemopreventive and therapeutic agent. Although genetic and environmental factors including common low penetrant alleles, diet, body mass index (BMI), and vitamin D levels may affect risk, their significance and multiple joint effects are unclear. Extensive data exists in support of a critical role for Vitamin D3 [25(OH) vitamin D] on Pca risk. However, it is difficult to determine its importance mainly because Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin, and serum levels are strongly influenced by skin color, genetic ancestry, age, BMI, and environmental factors such as sunlight exposure and diet. The goal of this project is to explore the effects of serum Vitamin D, UVR exposure, skin color, age, BMI, and genes involved in Vitamin D synthesis, metabolism and signaling on Pca and aggressive Pca risk in a study of 2,000 AA and 2,000 EA men. Men aged 40-79 will be recruited from a consortium of Chicago hospitals including, the University Illinois at Chicago Hospital System, University of Chicago Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, John H. Stroger Cook County Hospital, and the Jesse Brown Veteran Affairs Medical Center. This project will improve our understanding of the role Vitamin D plays on prostate cancer susceptibility, specifically among African Americans, and if lower vitamin D levels in AAs account for a portion of the disparity in Pca incidence and mortality between AAs and EAs. More importantly, given that UVR and diet are general environmental exposures that can be easily modified, understanding their impact may have broad health implications.  NARRATIVE Vitamin D has been shown to induce differentiation of prostate cells and to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. There has been epidemiologic evidence linking vitamin D status to breast, colon and prostate cancer. Prospective studies have been lacking and among the literature there have been inconclusive results. Notably, these studies are lacking in numbers of men of African ancestry who are likely to have aggressive prostate cancer and to be more vitamin D deficient. Also the studies fail to look at the interaction of vitamin D level, sun exposure, skin color, and genetic variation in genes in the vitamin D synthesis and metabolism pathway. Here we will propose a prospective study of serum vitamin D (25-OH D) levels and prostate cancer risk among African American and European American men aged 40-79. The study will be conducted at five Chicago area institutions, the University Illinois at Chicago Hospital System, University of Chicago Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, John H.

"Genome-wide sequencing of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men have two times or more the incidence rate of prostate cancer than other U.S. populations, and high rates of prostate cancer are also seen in other African and African-derived populations. It is generally accepted that both common and rare genetic variants contribute to risk of complex diseases such as prostate cancer, however their relative contributions to overall heritability is a subject of intense controversy. For rare variants to have a significant influence on the risk of complex disease the spectrum of effect sizes must be considerably larger in magnitude than for common variants; to date however there is only limited evidence for or against this hypothesis since the means of comprehensively testing rare variation in the genome has not been possible until very recently. In this proposal we seek to test the contributions of both common and rare genetic variants to the risk of prostate cancer in men of American ancestry using a targeted genome-wide association study approach. In Aim 1 we plan to sequence (at 30x coverage) the exome and regulatory regions (~160 Mb) of the genome, as defined by epigenetic marks in prostate cancer cell lines, in 1,000 men of African ancestry (500 with aggressive disease) and 1,000 controls. Both single SNP and burden of rare variants analyses will be performed and replication testing of the most statistically significant sequence variations (~24,000) will be examined in additional samples of African ancestry (6,000 cases and 6,000 controls) through the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer (AAPC) consortium. In addition to association testing of single variants, we will conduct ""burden of rare variants analyses"" of coding and non-coding variants at the gene and pathway level. In Aim 2, we will examine interactions between associated variants, environmental factors (thereby better defining the role of these factors) and disease severity. In Aim 3, we will assess biological function of the novel risk alleles identified in Aim 1 using a staged approach of eQTL analysis followed by in vitro analyses of enhancer activity as well as allele-specific effects. This proposal spans the spectrum of genetic epidemiologic research in prostate cancer, from genetic discovery (for all prostate cancer as well as aggressive disease) to gene environment interaction testing, to biological understanding. We expect this work to significantly advance knowledge of the etiology of prostate cancer and racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer risk, and to guide the development of future preventive, early detection, prognostic and even therapeutic measures. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, we will conduct targeted genome-wide sequencing in men of African ancestry to reveal genetic markers that may contribute to their greater risk of prostate cancer. We expect findings from this study will make a major contribution to our understanding of genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer and the genetic basis underlying familial aggregation and heritability of this common cancer. Identifying more genetic predictors of risk will have widespread applicability and significance, leading to better risk models to more accurately predict a man's risk of developing prostate cancer, and better intensive screening and preventive strategies that target men at high risk.",Genome-wide sequencing of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry,8828839,R01CA165862,"['Accounting ', '

"Mitochondrial DNA and Prostate Cancer in African American     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mitochondria play a central role in cell proliferation, cell signaling and apoptosis. Mitochondria contain their own DNA (mtDNA). mtDNA serves as a determinant of human origin and ethnicity. Human mtDNA is a very small (16,569 bp) genome. The entire protein coding capacity of the mitochondrial genome is dedicated to the production of 13 protein subunits. These 13 proteins constitute various subunits that make up four oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes essential for energy (ATP) production and other mitochondrial function. African-American men (AAM) have the highest rate of prostate cancer, develop prostate cancer at an early age, present with a higher tumor grade at time of diagnosis, and have a higher rate of metastasis and mortality than Caucasian American men (CAM). The genetic mechanism(s) underlying this racial diversity in prostate cancer is not well understood. Our studies demonstrate that in AAM reduced mtDNA content plays an important role in prostate carcinogenesis. We measured the mtDNA copy number in white blood cells (WBC) and prostate tumor obtained from AAM and CAM. Our preliminary studies suggest that WBC of both AAM and CAM contained similar amount of mtDNA (copy number). However, when adjusted for age, Gleason grade and PSA (prostate specific antigen) the prostate tumors of AAM contained >6 times less mtDNA than CAM tumors. Our preliminary data suggest that mutations in nuclear gene encoding mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG1) induce depletion of mtDNA and increase tumorigenic potential of cancer cells in vitro. These studies suggest that mtDNA homeostasis must play an important role in carcinogenesis. Based on these observations we hypothesize that reduced mtDNA content plays a critical role in prostate tumorigenesis in AAM by significantly altering the mitochondrial OXPHOS. AIM 1: Determine whether mutational spectrum of POLG1 in AAM prostate tumors differs from POLG1 mutational spectrum of CAM. Identify distinctive mutations in POLG1 gene in primary prostate tumors of AAM and determine its functional significance on mtDNA depletion, OXPHOS activity and apoptosis. AIM 2: Determine the consequences of mutant POLG1 induced depletion of mtDNA on prostate tumorigenesis in vitro and in mouse xenograft model. The proposed development of mtDNA depletion in prostate cells has the significant potential to enhance our understanding of prostate tumorigenesis in the African American population. This proposal addresses the two key objectives of the PAR-09-160 requesting exploratory grants in basic cancer research in cancer health disparities (R21). These objectives include: 1) the development of ""new cell culture models/systems designed to investigate cancer disparities"" and 2) explores the susceptibility to prostate cancer in African-American men due to ""genetic differences"" in mtDNA content.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  African-American men (AAM) have the highest rate of prostate cancer, develop prostate cancer at an early age, present with a higher tumor grade at time of diagnosis, and have a higher rate of metastasis and mortality than European American men (EAM) (Powell 2007; Williams and Powell 2009). The genetic mechanism(s) underlying this racial diversity in prostate cancer is not well understood (Guo et al 2000). The proposed study will help determine how reduced mtDNA content found in African American men plays an important role in prostate tumorigenicity.

"A Network Analytic Approach to Modeling Variation in Prostate Cancer Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unexplained variation in the clinical management of prostate cancer is recognized as an important problem in cancer treatment. To investigate potential explanations for this variation, the proposed project uses a social network analytic approach to model the connections that exist between physicians caring for patients with prostate cancer. This approach explicitly recognizes the clinical reality that many patients face: they see multiple physicians for their screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care across a range of clinical venues and at various times. Not only does each physician contribute to the type and quality of care patients receive but also the relationships between physicians within a geographical region may be an important and modifiable determinant of care. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to map the connections between PCPs, urologists, and radiation oncologists as a network and examine whether specialists' positions in the network structure are related to their patient's prostate cancer treatment; (2) to determine whether the network structure helps explain observed differences in prostate cancer treatment between black and white men; and (3) to investigate the determinants of the network structure through a survey of PCPs about their referral decisions. To achieve these aims, this project uses SEER-Medicare claims data and a survey of PCPs. The SEER- Medicare sample consists of men with localized prostate cancer diagnosed from 1995-2005 and their associated PCP and specialist providers. The position of specialists in the cancer care networks will be quantitatively determined and the positions will be related to patient-level variation in the type and quality of cancer care and to racial differences in care. The survey of PCPs will elucidate the factors important in their referral decisions. Understanding observed variations may suggest ways that the network structure may be leveraged to improve quality in cancer care and reduce disparities in outcomes. The candidate, Craig Pollack, MD, MHS is an Assistant Professor in the Division of General Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine with a joint appointment in the Department of Epidemiology and membership in the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. His long-term goal is to become an independent, grant-funded health services researcher in the field of cancer control. His short-term goals are to develop expertise in cancer prevention and control, network analysis, advanced health services research methods, and organizational theory and provider behavior. Dr. Pollack has assembled a mentoring team that includes national leaders in cancer research, urological cancer, health disparities, and network analysis. The proposed project provides Dr. Pollack with the training, mentoring, and resources to become a successful independent investigator dedicated to improving cancer care.              Project Narrative Though prostate cancer is very common among older men, there exists a great deal of variation in how patients with early disease get treated. Using a technique called social network analysis, we examine how the connections and referral patterns between primary care physicians and specialists may influence the type, quality and equity of care that men receive.",A Network Analytic Approach to Modeling Variation in Prostate Cancer Care,8685905,K07CA151910,"['Affect ', ' Appointment ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health behavior ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Urologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Urological Cancer ', ' Urinary Tract Cancer ', ' Malignant Urinary Tract Neoplasm ', ' Urologic Cancer ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Radiation Oncologist ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Collection ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' working group ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' older men ', ' effective intervention ', ' Medicare claim ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K07,2014,156570,0.26712657279359514
"Decision Aids to Address Prostate Cancer Disparities in Minority Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American and some Native American men experience a greater burden of prostate cancer in the United States. Surgery and radiation therapy are effective treatments, but each has different quality of life implications for men and their partners. These treatments, although potentially life-saving impose their own burden related to treatment side effects. Some men may benefit from a monitoring approach called ""active surveillance"" if they have early, slow-growing prostate cancer. Making the right treatment choice depends of men being given all appropriate options and making sure they have a high quality conversation with their specialty provider. Minority men in particular are not always given the evidence they need to make the right choice for them, and doctors and healthcare systems may not always pay attention to what is important to them. Tools called ""decision aids"" can improve knowledge and may reduce the burden associated with prostate cancer treatment in minority men. These tools inform men about their disease severity, treatment options, and the quality of life implications of each treatment option. They can be delivered in clinical discussion with specialists or prior to a visit with a specialist. However, decision aids are not routinely usd in specialty practice for prostate cancer. A tablet-based tool we have developed, Prostate Choice, helps men tailor their choice based on their disease risk, life expectancy, and current sexual and urinary function. It can be used in the clinical conversation. Another tool, Knowing Your Options, is a website with comprehensive educational materials that is designed for use prior to visits with specialists. We want to study two kinds of decision aids - ones delivered in te visit with a specialist and one delivered before seeing a specialist as well as the combination of the two decision aids-to see if we can put patients in the best position possible to make the treatment choice that is right for them. We think these tools will reduce known disparities in patient knowledge and may improve the burden of men's symptoms a year after prostate cancer diagnosis. We propose an experiment that delivers the two types of decision aids compared to usual care by assigning 32 specialty practices to get different types of decision aids or usual care. To test the experiment we will enroll 310 men (120 white, 120 African American, 70 American Indian/Alaska Native). From this experiment we will see whether one or the other of the two proposed decision aids or the combination of the two improves men's knowledge most compared to usual care. We will be able to determine whether those effects are the same or different for men from different racial backgrounds and education levels. By testing these tools we will determine whether they can reduce known disparities in patient knowledge and quality of life in minority men.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among the more than 200,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, minority men face significant disparities in disease severity, knowledge about treatment options and implications, survival and symptom burden. Decision aids delivered within or prior to specialty visits or the combination might help reduce disparities by improving patient knowledge, and allowing them to make a treatment choice that is appropriate and that fits with their priorities related to sexual and urinary function. This proposal will test in-visit, out-of-vsit and combined in-visit/out-of-visit decision aids for African-American and American Indian/Alaska Native men for initial prostate cancer treatment decisions in a cancer cooperative group.                ",Decision Aids to Address Prostate Cancer Disparities in Minority Men,8771566,R01MD008934,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' literacy ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Regrets ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Mediating ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' tool ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' urinary ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' health information technology ', ' randomized trial ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' ']",NIMHD,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2014,417707,0.1926486048293844
"METABOLOMIC PROFILING AND BIOLOGIC BASIS OF RACIAL DISPARITY IN PROSTATE CANCER     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of our research plan is to reduce the disproportionate effects of prostate cancer on African American men. A guiding principle of our methodology is biochemical differences exist between prostate cancers of African American and European American origin and that these differences can explain, in part, prostate cancer health disparity. In this application, we propose to use the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover these underlying differences. Metabolomics describes the science of quantifying the levels of metabolites (e.g., small molecules) that are the byproducts of cellular metabolism. That is to say, in this kind of analysis we are measuring the biochemical entities (or metabolites) that are produced by the functional machinery of the cell. With knowledge of the identity of specific metabolites we can infer the biological processes that produced them, thus gaining insight into a cell's metabolism. To date, a metabolomic analysis of prostate cancer health disparity has not been reported. In preliminary studies, we have profiled the metabolome of prostate cancers from African-American and European American men and have identified specific racially distinct metabololites as well as biological pathways associated with each. In this proposal, we will i) validate and refine the metabolomic profile of prostate cancers from African American and European American men, ii) evaluate the role of specific biochemical pathways in prostate cancers of African American and European American men and iii) develop urine based metabolic markers for high risk prostate cancer in African American and European American men. At the conclusion of this study, we will have developed a racially derived metabolomic model for prostate cancer as well as identified candidate pathways for future drug targeting.            At present, it is not known how the prostate cancer metabolome contributes to health disparities. The information gleaned from this proposal could rapidly revolutionize current diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches by revealing the biological underpinnings of prostate cancer health disparity.

"Chemical markers of heterocyclic aromatic amines for human biomonitoring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and second leading cause of cancer-related death among men in the United States. Identifying risk factors of this disease and developing strategies for prevention are critical. A number of epidemiologic studies have reported an association between frequent consumption of well-done cooked meats, containing the heterocyclic aromatic amine (HAA) 2-amino-1-methyl- 6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and prostate cancer risk. PhIP is a potent rodent prostate carcinogen, and it induces oxidative stress, atrophy of the acini, and inflammation of the prostate. These are critical features that occur in human prostate carcinogenesis. A paradigm has been put forth for a causal role of consumption of well-done cooked meats containing PhIP (and other HAAs) in the etiology of prostate cancer; however, biomarkers of exposure and DNA damage are lacking to validate this model.  Our long-term goal is to assess the cancer risk posed by HAAs, by employing chemical markers that may distinguish individuals at different levels of risk. In this grant renewal, our objective is to assess dietary exposure to PhIP and its potential to induce damage to DNA in the prostate in relation to other HAAs, meat genotoxicants, and endogenous electrophiles produced in the cell, by employing mass spectrometric (MS)- based methods to measure genotoxicants and identify their biomarkers of DNA damage in the prostate.  We will implement our recently established biomarkers of HAAs and other cooked meat genotoxicants and their DNA adduction products in cohorts of African American and Caucasian men with benign prostate hyper- plasia or prostate cancer who frequently eat well-done cooked meat. In Aim 1) HAA exposure will be assessed by measurement of HAAs accrued in hair; DNA adducts of HAAs, other meat genotoxicants, and endogenous electrophiles, will be determined by different MS scanning methods, in prostate. In Aim 2) Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded prostate tissue, an underutilized biospecimen in biomonitoring DNA damage, will be employed to screen for HAA-DNA adducts in subjects undergoing prostatectomy. Adduct levels will be compared to those values obtained by current but non-specific immunohistochemical techniques. MS methods will also be implemented to measure PhIP-serum albumin adducts as long-lived biomarkers of the biologically effective dose. In Aim 3) we will conduct high density genotyping of genes encoding enzymes involved carcinogen metabolism that may impact DNA damage in the prostate. Prostate HAA-DNA adduct levels will be correlated to HAA levels in hair; the levels of HAA and other DNA adducts in prostate will be correlated to genotypes of phase I and II xenobiotic metabolism enzymes, which impact biological activity.  Our findings will provide direct measurement of DNA damage and assess the relative contribution of HAAs, other cooked meat genotoxicants and endogenous electrophiles to the genetic damage of DNA in the prostate.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cooking of meat well-done produces heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), which are prostate carcinogens in experimental animals and potential human carcinogens. The quantitative measurement of HAA exposure and identification of mutation-prone DNA adducts of HAAs in the human prostate would strengthen the biological plausibility for a role of HAAs in the etiology of prostate cancer. With these data in hand, educational and primary cancer prevention efforts may be devised because there are methods of cooking meats that do not lead to substantial formation of hazardous HAAs.            ",Chemical markers of heterocyclic aromatic amines for human biomonitoring,8758877,R01CA122320,"['epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Animals ', ' benign prostate hyperplasia ', ' Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ', ' Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Cells ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA Injury ', ' DNA Damage ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Enzymes ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Hand ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lipid Peroxidation ', ' Meat ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatectomy ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Serum Albumin ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Caucasians ', ' PhIP ', ' 2-Amino-1-Methyl-6-Phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Second Neoplasm ', ' Second Malignancy ', ' Metachronous Second Primary Neoplasms ', ' Metachronous Neoplasms ', ' Second Primary Neoplasms ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Carcinogen-DNA Adducts ', ' DNA Adducts ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' cooking ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' human tissue ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' beef ', ' adduct ', ' cancer risk ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism Detection ', ' Polymorphism Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' acinus ', ' Acinus organ component ', ' Formalin ', ' Xenobiotic Metabolism ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Dose ', ' DNA Adduct Formation ', ' DNA Adduction ', ' Data ', ' red meat consumption ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Primary Cancer Prevention ', ' Carcinogen Metabolism ', ' Monitor ', ' feeding ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' volunteer ', ' heterocyclic aromatic amines ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' prostate tumorigenesis ', ' prostate carcinogenesis ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2014,507963,0.30361774924327717
"Genomics and Predictive Modeling of Prostate Cancer Heath Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) men have an increased incidence and earlier age of onset of prostate cancer and two-fold higher rate of mortality from disease than Caucasian American (CA) men that does not correlate with socioeconomic status. Recent work in the PI's laboratory has shed light on the organization of the genomes of metastatic prostate cancers and primary prostate cancers from CA and AA men and has demonstrated that innate tumor characteristics may contribute to the observed health disparities. Compared to normal, non-cancerous genomes, the tumor genomes contain copy number alteration (CNA) gains or losses of genes that mediate initiation and progression. When matched for age, Gleason score and stage, the genomes of primary AA prostate cancers have a greater number of CNAs that predispose to metastasis compared to the genomes of CA prostate cancers. This study will validate the initial prostate cancer metastatic potential/health disparity study through somatic genomic DNA copy number analysis. A risk metric will be developed for each CNA that will be incorporated into a model that estimates the likelihood that a tumor will metastasize. The genetic predictors will be combined with clinical risk predictors to develop and evaluate a comprehensive statistical risk assessment model. Areas under the receiver-operator curves will be assessed to measure and compare the discriminatory accuracy. Paired analyses will be performed to demonstrate the presence of similar CNA profiles in biopsy and corresponding radical prostatectomy tumor specimens. In addition, whole genome sequencing will be applied to AA and CA tumors of different characteristics - primaries of different metastatic potential and metastases. These will be analyzed for mutations, duplications, and deletions that may have had a causal role.          This project is built on a study that identified innate genomic differences of AA and CA prostate cancers through a novel application of natural selection theory. The research of tumor biology will translate into a risk model for determining whether prostate cancers should be treated aggressively or with watchful waiting. The metastasis-promoting genes identified could become targets for new therapies.

"METABOLOMIC PROFILING AND BIOLOGIC BASIS OF RACIAL DISPARITY IN PROSTATE CANCER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of our research plan is to reduce the disproportionate effects of prostate cancer on African American men. A guiding principle of our methodology is biochemical differences exist between prostate cancers of African American and European American origin and that these differences can explain, in part, prostate cancer health disparity. In this application, we propose to use the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover these underlying differences. Metabolomics describes the science of quantifying the levels of metabolites (e.g., small molecules) that are the byproducts of cellular metabolism. That is to say, in this kind of analysis we are measuring the biochemical entities (or metabolites) that are produced by the functional machinery of the cell. With knowledge of the identity of specific metabolites we can infer the biological processes that produced them, thus gaining insight into a cell's metabolism. To date, a metabolomic analysis of prostate cancer health disparity has not been reported. In preliminary studies, we have profiled the metabolome of prostate cancers from African-American and European American men and have identified specific racially distinct metabololites as well as biological pathways associated with each. In this proposal, we will i) validate and refine the metabolomic profile of prostate cancers from African American and European American men, ii) evaluate the role of specific biochemical pathways in prostate cancers of African American and European American men and iii) develop urine based metabolic markers for high risk prostate cancer in African American and European American men. At the conclusion of this study, we will have developed a racially derived metabolomic model for prostate cancer as well as identified candidate pathways for future drug targeting. At present, it is not known how the prostate cancer metabolome contributes to health disparities. The information gleaned from this proposal could rapidly revolutionize current diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches by revealing the biological underpinnings of prostate cancer health disparity.",METABOLOMIC PROFILING AND BIOLOGIC BASIS OF RACIAL DISPARITY IN PROSTATE CANCER,8857576,U01CA167234,"['Affect ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Body Fluids ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Names ', ' Cyclic Nucleotides ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' poly ADP ribose synthetase ', ' poly ADP polymerase ', ' Poly(ADPribose) Polymerase ', ' Poly(ADPR) Polymerase ', ' Poly(ADP-Ribose) Transferase ', ' Poly(ADP-Ribose) Synthase ', ' PARS ', ' PARP Polymerase ', ' ADP-Ribosyltransferase (Polymerizing) ', ' Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' N-methyl-glycine ', ' N-Methylglycine ', ' Methylglycine ', ' Sarcosine ', ' Science ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Glean ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' prognostic ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Inequality ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Therapeutic ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Genetic ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' Purines/Pyrimidines/Nucleotides/Nucleic Acids Metabolism ', ' Nucleotide Synthesis ', ' nucleotide metabolism ', ' novel ', ' sober ', ' sobriety ', ' Reporting ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' urinary ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' PC3 ', ' PC3 cell line ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer statistics ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' transcriptomics ', ' high risk ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' arm ', ' prostate cancer model ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' ']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2014,100437,0.42266473425442486
"(PQC3) Using an Immunoscore to Assess Tumor-medicated Immune Variations in African -American     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite a body of evidence demonstrating the importance of the tumor-mediated immune response to the outcome of prostate cancer patients, no studies have adequately evaluated the tumor-mediated immune response in African American patients. Given that the African American race is a risk factor for more aggressive and lethal prostate cancer, the purpose of this study is to test the overall hypothesis that difference in the quantity and localization of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes into the prostate gland correlat with PCa racial health disparities and that androgen signaling regulates this process.  For this study, we will utilize a prostate tissue biorepository collected between 2003 and 2013, containing over 6,500 archival prostate cancer specimens, 25% (1,630) of which are from African American men. To test our hypothesis in a definitive way, we will utilize the concept of an ""immunoscore."" The immunoscore, a combined score based on the quantitation of CD3+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in a tumor, has already been found to be a strong predictive indicator in patients with colorectal cancer and is only starting to be explored for other solid tumor types. In our Specific Aim 1, we will adapt existing immunoscoring methodology to be compatible with and applicable to prostate cancer, and will test the reproducibility and robustness of calculating the prostate cancer immunoscore in a small, preliminary panel of African American and Caucasian patients from our tissue bank. In our Specific Aim 2, we will determine the prostate cancer immunoscore and androgen receptor status in a large cohort of African American (1,630) and Caucasian (1,630) patients, for which we also have 10-year follow-up data. We will then be able to determine if differences exist between African Americans and Caucasians with respect to: prostate cancer immunoscores, the spectrum/quantity of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+), and/or androgen receptor status; and if race is predictive of any of these variables. In our Specific Aim 3, we will perform Cox regression analysis and statistical modeling to determine if the prostate cancer immunoscore and/or AR status are predictors of long-term clinical outcomes (biochemical recurrence and/or disease-specific mortality) in African American and/or Caucasian patients with localized prostate cancer. If so, we will be able to construct an immunoscore-based classifier that clinicians can use to better predict outcome in their African American patients with prostate cancer-something that currently doesn't exist and is desperately needed. This work will also provide the clinical justification for future mechanisti studies surrounding race, tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes, and androgen signaling in prostate cancer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to characterize and determine the clinical implications of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in a large cohort of African American patients with prostate cancer. A potential result of this work will be the generation of a new predictive classifier for clinical outcomes in African Americans with prostate cancer that is based on the quantitation of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.            ",(PQC3) Using an Immunoscore to Assess Tumor-medicated Immune Variations in African -American,8792043,R21CA190076,"['Affect ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgens ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Cells ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatectomy ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stains ', ' statistics ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Tissue/Specimen Collection ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Tissue Banking ', ' T3 molecule ', ' T3 Complex ', ' T3 Antigens ', ' OKT3 antigen ', ' CD3 molecule ', ' CD3 Complex ', ' CD3 ', ' CD3 Antigens ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' prognostic ', ' Lesion ', ' Epithelial ', ' Individual ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immune ', ' Event ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' cohort ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Sampling ', ' Prostate Carcinoma Metastatic ', ' Metastatic Prostate Cancer ', ' Formalin ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' LYT3 ', ' CD8B1 ', ' CD8B ', ' CD8 ', ' CD8B1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Invaded ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' epithelial to mesenchymal transition ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' comparative ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' ']",NCI,BON SECOURS RICHMOND COMMUNITY HOSPITAL,R21,2014,127238,0.3999541184639876
"Community-Based Research to Improve Prostate Cancer Patient Treatment Decisions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians recognize the need for and support informed decision making as a mechanism for helping men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer and are considering treatment. Men need help to reduce decisional regret, reduce decisional conflict, improve satisfaction with their treatment decisions and develop a plan for coping with the sequelae of quality-of-life compromising side effects. A variety of factors interact at multiple socio-ecologic levels to facilitate or prevent informed decision making from occurring. The manner in which culture influences prostate cancer treatment decision-making among African Americans remains understudied. Research from other health contexts strongly suggests that participatory action research can be helpful in generating new culturally appropriate knowledge to apply to this problem. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that interventions developed using participatory research approaches are effective for improving informed treatment decision making for prostate cancer with African-American men. The purpose of the current Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) grant application is to provide the applicant, a newly appointed assistant professor of oncology at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI), with appropriate training and research experience that will enable him to function as an independent investigator building a research program in disparities and prostate cancer. Support provided by this training grant will provide Dr. Ross with sufficient release time (75%) to complete a career development plan that consists of carefully selected didactic coursework, individualized instruction, seminars, and research experiences grounded in applied ethnographic and community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. The aims of Dr. Ross' proposed research are (1) to formalize and strengthen a community-research partnership between a group of prostate cancer advocates and the Office of Cancer Health Disparities Research at Roswell Park Cancer Institute that will guide community driven cancer educational initiatives; (2) to conduct ethnographic research with African-American men and their significant others to provide a holistic, contextualized description of their experiences with prostate cancer treatment; and (3) to use a participatory research approach to create a culturally appropriate treatment decision-making intervention for African- American men and their significant others. The proposed training and experience in ethnography and CBPR will yield rich insights into prostate cancer education for hard-to-reach, high risk populations. It will also contribute vital information to the fields of health education and behavior to enhance cancer control.

"CNTR OF EXCELLENCE FOR PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH EDUCATION AND COMM SERVICE The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) was established in 1999 at Clark  Atlanta University to carry-out basic research in cancer biology and drug discovery. In 2004, the CCRTD  decided to concentrate in the area of prostate cancer due to disproportionately higher incidence and  mortality rate of this disease in African-American men. The current proposal requests support to continue the  Center of Excellence in Prostate Cancer Research, Education and Community Education. The main  objectives of this center will be 1) To carry out high quality basic research in cell and molecular biology of  prostate cancer and to identify underlying biological reasons for racial disparities, 2) To continue our training  program for undergraduate and graduate students to provide research training in the area of prostate cancer  and hence increase the number of minority (primarily African American) scientists in this area of research, 3)  To expand the community-based educational program for raising awareness on prevention, screening, early  detection and treatment of prostate cancer. These goals will be achieved in collaboration with the Clark  Atlanta University Division of Communication Arts, Midtown Urology Educational Foundation, Saint Joseph's  Hospital Men's Health and Wellness Center, and other community organizations. In the Research Core, we  propose three research projects focusing on prostate cancer cell and molecular biology and racial disparities.  In the Training Core, we are requesting support for training of four graduate and six undergraduate students  in the area of cancer biology and community service. In the Community Outreach/Education Core, we are  requesting support to expand upon the community outreach and educational activities to include a larger  media arena and coverage. The overall activities of the center will be monitored by the Administrative Core.  The activities of the Administrative Core will be overseen by the Institutional (lAC), External (EAC) and Local  External (LEAC) Advisory Committees. The long term goals of the center will be to understand the biology of  prostate cancer, to increase the number of African-American scientists in cancer research, and to educate  the African-American community in the areas of prostate cancer prevention, early detection and treatment. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Prostate cancer affects the African-American community disproportionately.

"Genome-wide sequencing of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men have two times or more the incidence rate of prostate cancer than other U.S. populations, and high rates of prostate cancer are also seen in other African and African-derived populations. It is generally accepted that both common and rare genetic variants contribute to risk of complex diseases such as prostate cancer, however their relative contributions to overall heritability is a subject of intense controversy. For rare variants to have a significant influence on the risk of complex disease the spectrum of effect sizes must be considerably larger in magnitude than for common variants; to date however there is only limited evidence for or against this hypothesis since the means of comprehensively testing rare variation in the genome has not been possible until very recently. In this proposal we seek to test the contributions of both common and rare genetic variants to the risk of prostate cancer in men of American ancestry using a targeted genome-wide association study approach. In Aim 1 we plan to sequence (at 30x coverage) the exome and regulatory regions (~160 Mb) of the genome, as defined by epigenetic marks in prostate cancer cell lines, in 1,000 men of African ancestry (500 with aggressive disease) and 1,000 controls. Both single SNP and burden of rare variants analyses will be performed and replication testing of the most statistically significant sequence variations (~24,000) will be examined in additional samples of African ancestry (6,000 cases and 6,000 controls) through the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer (AAPC) consortium. In addition to association testing of single variants, we will conduct ""burden of rare variants analyses"" of coding and non-coding variants at the gene and pathway level. In Aim 2, we will examine interactions between associated variants, environmental factors (thereby better defining the role of these factors) and disease severity. In Aim 3, we will assess biological function of the novel risk alleles identified in Aim 1 using a staged approach of eQTL analysis followed by in vitro analyses of enhancer activity as well as allele-specific effects. This proposal spans the spectrum of genetic epidemiologic research in prostate cancer, from genetic discovery (for all prostate cancer as well as aggressive disease) to gene environment interaction testing, to biological understanding. We expect this work to significantly advance knowledge of the etiology of prostate cancer and racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer risk, and to guide the development of future preventive, early detection, prognostic and even therapeutic measures.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, we will conduct targeted genome-wide sequencing in men of African ancestry to reveal genetic markers that may contribute to their greater risk of prostate cancer. We expect findings from this study will make a major contribution to our understanding of genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer and the genetic basis underlying familial aggregation and heritability of this common cancer. Identifying more genetic predictors of risk will have widespread applicability and significance, leading to better risk models to more accurately predict a man's risk of developing prostate cancer, and better intensive screening and preventive strategies that target men at high risk.",Genome-wide sequencing of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry,8708786,R01CA165862,"['Accounting ', '

"Biological and Environmental modifiers of Vitamin D3 and Prostate Cancer Risk  ABSTRACT Disparities in prostate cancer (Pca) are caused by complex interactions of genetic susceptibility, individual risk factors, and environmental factors. Pca is the second leading cause of death among all men; however African American (AA) men have the highest mortality rate of Pca of any racial/ethnic group in the U.S. This difference in mortality accounts for 44% of the overall cancer mortality disparity between AA and European-American (EA) men. Thus, there is a critical need to explore the etiologic pathways that contribute to this disparity. Unfortunately, the only well-established risk factors (age, race and family history) for Pca are non-modifiable. However recent studies have found low levels of vitamin D have been associated with increased Pca risk, and treatment with vitamin D has reduced Pca disease progression in multiple studies. These studies support the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of Pca and that vitamin D is a potential chemopreventive and therapeutic agent. Although genetic and environmental factors including common low penetrant alleles, diet, body mass index (BMI), and vitamin D levels may affect risk, their significance and multiple joint effects are unclear. Extensive data exists in support of a critical role for Vitamin D3 [25(OH) vitamin D] on Pca risk. However, it is difficult to determine its importance mainly because Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin, and serum levels are strongly influenced by skin color, genetic ancestry, age, BMI, and environmental factors such as sunlight exposure and diet. The goal of this project is to explore the effects of serum Vitamin D, UVR exposure, skin color, age, BMI, and genes involved in Vitamin D synthesis, metabolism and signaling on Pca and aggressive Pca risk in a study of 2,000 AA and 2,000 EA men. Men aged 40-79 will be recruited from a consortium of Chicago hospitals including, the University Illinois at Chicago Hospital System, University of Chicago Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, John H. Stroger Cook County Hospital, and the Jesse Brown Veteran Affairs Medical Center. This project will improve our understanding of the role Vitamin D plays on prostate cancer susceptibility, specifically among African Americans, and if lower vitamin D levels in AAs account for a portion of the disparity in Pca incidence and mortality between AAs and EAs. More importantly, given that UVR and diet are general environmental exposures that can be easily modified, understanding their impact may have broad health implications.  NARRATIVE Vitamin D has been shown to induce differentiation of prostate cells and to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. There has been epidemiologic evidence linking vitamin D status to breast, colon and prostate cancer. Prospective studies have been lacking and among the literature there have been inconclusive results. Notably, these studies are lacking in numbers of men of African ancestry who are likely to have aggressive prostate cancer and to be more vitamin D deficient. Also the studies fail to look at the interaction of vitamin D level, sun exposure, skin color, and genetic variation in genes in the vitamin D synthesis and metabolism pathway. Here we will propose a prospective study of serum vitamin D (25-OH D) levels and prostate cancer risk among African American and European American men aged 40-79. The study will be conducted at five Chicago area institutions, the University Illinois at Chicago Hospital System, University of Chicago Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, John H.

"Addressing Prostate Cancer Information Disparities with eHealth Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (CaP) is a prevalent and serious disease with no known methods of primary prevention. African American (AA) men are disproportionately affected by CaP; they are 60% more likely to be diagnosed and nearly 2.5 times more likely to die from the disease than White men. Screening with prostate specific antigen (PSA) is the main method of early detection, although it remains of unproven benefit. Major medical organizations debate the potential benefits versus harms of prostate cancer screening (PCS), but they all emphasize educating men about the potential limitations, risks and benefits of PCS, and helping them to make individualized decisions with their medical providers (""shared decision-making,"" or SDM). Nonetheless, this is not the norm in clinical practice, especially for AA men. Numerous decision aids (DAs) have been developed to help men make informed decisions regarding PCS. Unlike most prior PCS studies, however, we have developed a culturally relevant DA; make use of low cost, modern technologies to deliver the multi-media, individually tailored DA; gather data from patients and providers to study the dyad; and assess the potential for integration of PCSPrep into clinical practice. We address these research gaps by testing the Prostate Cancer Screening Preparation (PCSPrep) -- a tailored, interactive, Web-based, and culturally relevant DA -- on outcomes related to SDM among AA men. Primary care providers (PCP) affiliated with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center will be recruited. From each PCP, we will recruit and enroll 10 AA men ages 45-70 (N=100). Study participants will complete a pre-test, PCSPrep, and post-test immediately prior to a routine medical visit. PCS discussions between patient and provider will be audio-taped and both patients and providers will complete assessments immediately after the visit. Specific aims are to estimate the impact of PCSPrep on: (1) patients' PCS knowledge, decision self-efficacy, and decisional consistency; (2) providers' perceptions of patient engagement, concordance between provider/patient ratings of SDM; and (3) feasibility and acceptability of integrating PCSPrep         into primary care practice. The ultimate goal is to reduce disparities in access to high quality information about PCS and to empower AA men to be active participants in their care. Results will not only inform decision-making for PCS, but can inform the development of interventions for other conditions or procedures that call for SDM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is significant because it is expected to lead to the expansion of eHealth technology to assist men making complex medical decisions with their providers about a screening test for which there is uncertain efficacy. As a result of this project we will have a culturally relevant, multi-media, individually tailored DA that will prepare men to take part in SDM about PCS.  Moreover, we will have preliminary information about the impact of provider discussions on men's PCS preferences and the extent to which patients and providers view the same clinical encounter differently. This will ultimately lead to multi-level interventions directed at patients, providers and health systems to improve patient-centered decision-making.

"Exploration of Cadmium as an Endocrine Disruptor in Prostate Cancer Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tremendous race disparities exist in prostate cancer incidence and mortality. Reasons for these disparities remain unknown but are likely due to both environmental and biological factors. In vitro studies suggest that the heavy metal cadmium is an endocrine disruptor of the androgen receptor. The androgen receptor is essential for normal prostate growth and development but is also the primary drug target for treatment of prostate cancer as it controls a plethora of downstream targets involved in disease progression. Previous studies indicate that compared to European-Americans, African-Americans have had higher urinary and blood cadmium levels and, have higher androgen receptor protein levels and different patterns of AR-target expression in prostate tissue. Our preliminary data (N=59) suggests that African-Americans may have higher prostate tissue cadmium levels than European-Americans. Our data also suggests that cadmium is associated with androgen receptor protein expression in prostate tumor tissue but that race modifies the association. Therefore, race differences in the association between cadmium and the androgen receptor could lead to differences in expression/signaling of downstream androgen receptor targets involved in tumor aggressiveness and disease recurrence. In this R21 study, we propose to further investigate cadmium as an endocrine disruptor of the androgen receptor by capitalizing on a well-defined, ethnically diverse cohort of prostatectomy cases (N=415, 44% AA, diagnosed 1999-2004) that originally participated in the Gene-Environment Interaction in Prostate Cancer (GECAP) (R01 ES11126) study. In prostate tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue, we will measure cadmium as well as a panel of additional toxic and essential metals that can affect cadmium toxicity. We will also measure the whole-genome transcriptome in tumor tissue. The transcriptome includes all coding and non-coding RNAs transcriptionally expressed by genes in a population of cells. We will determine whether prostate tumor tissue cadmium level is associated with androgen receptor protein expression in the larger cohort and will determine if race does indeed modify the association between cadmium and androgen receptor expression. Further, we'll determine whether prostate tumor tissue cadmium level is associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness or biochemical recurrence. In addition, we will examine the combined association of cadmium level and androgen receptor protein expression with regard to the prostate tumor transcriptome in African - and European- Americans. From our preliminary data and other existing reports, we hypothesize that race differences in the association of cadmium and the androgen receptor result in differences in expression of downstream androgen receptor targets that play a role in disease progression, and further, that these differences may in part explain race disparities in prostate cancer progression. If our hypothesis is confirmed, the GECAP data set contains an enormous resource of demographic, clinical and medical history, dietary, occupational and genetic information to investigate variables that may explain these findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cadmium is recognized as an endocrine disruptor, a human carcinogen, and an important biological hazard in the U.S. based on its toxicity and abundance. If our hypotheses are supported, this study will provide evidence that cadmium is an endocrine disruptor in the human prostate and will identify a new avenue through which race disparities in prostate cancer progression may occur. Further, our transcriptome related findings may help identify pathways to pursue in future research that could ultimately be used to tailor prostate cancer therapy rather than using broad treatment with androgen deprivation which is accompanied by a wide spectrum of negative side-effects. Most importantly, because steroid receptors have highly conserved promoter and DNA binding domains, our findings will have relevance for other diseases in which cadmium and endocrine disruption have been implicated, and in which race differences exist including breast cancer, neuroendocrinology, cardiovascular disease, thyroid disease, and metabolism and obesity.                ",Exploration

"Basic Cancer Research in Cancer Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common lethal tumor among US males yet little is known about its causative mechanisms. This study proposes to examine how glycosylation of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) affects steroid hormone signaling in prostate cancer. We will define the impact of SHBG glycosylation, including the D327N SHBG polymorphism, on steroid hormone associated prostate cancer risk and disparity in African and Caucasian Americans. Protein glycosylation is critical for interaction of prostate cells with its environment. We will evaluate how glycosylation of SHBG affect the distribution of the protein between plasma and tissue and how this affects disease development. The quantification of the SHBG glycoforms will be achieved by novel LC-MS assays. In addition, we will comprehensively summarize the impact of polymorphisms on N-glycosylation in the human proteome. Our hypothesis is that prostate cancer risk and progression are related to the variability in the glycosylation of SHBG. Our objective is to perform quantitative mass spectrometric assays of SHBG glycosylation in conjunction with measurement of steroid hormones. We will select men for phenotypic characterization by genotyping of a case control population with 50% African American representation. In addition, we will genotype a case series for which both serum and tissue are available. Steroid hormones will be measured by GC-MS. We will analyze the SHBG glycoforms and steroid hormones at the tissue level and in the circulation. The study is expected to fill important gaps in our understanding of prostate cancer etiology and progression. The analysis of SHBG glycoforms will provide new information on the biological factors underlying prostate carcinogenesis. The results are expected to improve prostate cancer prevention, detection and intervention strategies.            This research is important because a comparative analysis of SHBG glycosylation and steroid hormones in prostate cancer, especially in African American men, has not been previously undertaken.

"Systematic Genetic Characterization of African American Prostate Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United Sates, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and African- American men have long been known to exhibit a higher incidence and increased mortality compared to men of other ethnic groups. Although socioeconomic factors and unequal access to health care undoubtedly contribute to this disparity, differences in incidence and outcome persist after adjusting for these factors. Thus, tumor biological and/or genetic aspects may underpin adverse outcomes in African-American prostate cancer. To date, however, few studies have queried the molecular biology or somatic genetics of African-American prostate cancer in-depth, meaning that our understanding of the spectrum of factors influencing these disparities remains incomplete. The over-arching goal of this proposal is to undertake a definitive somatic genetic and functional characterization of African-American prostate cancer. To accomplish this goal, we will develop a targeted, massively parallel sequencing platform that interrogates the spectrum of recurrent alterations (base mutations, chromosomal copy number changes, and selected chromosomal rearrangements) relevant to prostate cancer. We will utilize this platform to perform tumor mutation profiling in a cohort of two hundred prostate tumor specimens obtained from African American men, leveraging knowledge from prostate cancer genome sequencing studies currently ongoing at the Broad Institute and elsewhere. Patterns of somatic alterations observed in this cohort will be compared to those of European-American prostate cancer. In addition, we will test top candidate genes affected by recurrently altered prostate cancer genomic loci for effects on the tumorigenic phenotype in primary prostate epithelial cells obtained from men of European or African descent. Once completed, this project should provide decisive insights into the spectrum of and functional relevance of somatic genetic alterations in African-American prostate cancer, thereby affirming or refuting the hypothesis that these biological factors undergird this pervasive cancer health disparity.          Prostate cancer in African-American men occurs more frequently, earlier in life, and with increased lethality when compared to European Americans. Undoubtedly, the genesis of this profound disparity is multi-factorial; however, a detailed study of the genetics and biology of African-American prostate cancer has not previously been undertaken. The focus of this grant is a systematic study of recurrent somatic genetic alterations in African-American prostate cancer using targeted, massively parallel sequencing. In addition, we will query specific cancer alterations in cell culture models derived from African-American and European-American patients. Upon completion, this study will likely constitute one of the most comprehensive functional genetic efforts yet undertaken in African-American prostate cancer. Insights from this study may inform new treatment strategies that prove broadly relevant across diverse human populations.

"Financial well-being following prostate cancer diagnosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer research has consistently shown evidence of racial/ethnic disparities across the cancer  continuum from detection/screening and treatment-related outcomes to mortality; and socioeconomic status  (SES) has been suggested as a substantial factor in the racial differences; yet, the research results for SES  disparities i prostate cancer-related outcomes as well as SES as an explanatory factor in racial/ethnic  disparities in prostate cancer have been inconsistent. Some have suggested that this inconsistency may be due to imprecise (and inconsistent or incomplete) measurement of socioeconomic circumstances.   Thus, there have been calls in the cancer disparities literature for greater clarity on the pathways and mechanisms causing differential cancer outcomes across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the conceptualization AND operationalization of socioeconomic circumstances in this literature.  An expanded view of the socioeconomic context for prostate cancer patients might uncover socioeconomic factors influencing disparities in treatment-related outcomes over and above the traditional SES measures; and a construct to capture this expanded socioeconomic context is financial well-being (FWB).  The  specific aims of the research project are to:  1) Develop and refine a conceptual model of the multidimensional  construct FWB using structured interviews with prostate cancer patients and a focus group with clinical social  workers; 2) Develop and pilot test a measure of FWB; 3) Evaluate the psychometric properties of the measure  of FWB and investigate the association between components of FWB, socio-demographic characteristics, and  treatment selection and adherence and perceived quality of treatment; and 4) Investigate differences in  responses to FWB items across racial/ethnic groups and evaluate potential measurement bias across  racial/ethnic groups. The successful completion of the research project will result in a valid measurement and causal model of FWB that articulates how the dimensions of FWB are related to prostate cancer treatment-related outcomes.  The candidate, Dr. Reginald Tucker-Seeley, is a Research Associate in the Center for Community Based Research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The proposed five year NCI Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) will provide the necessary mentoring, training, and research experiences in cancer care/health services, psycho-oncology, and measures/scale development to implement the proposed research project.  His long term career goal is to become an independent investigator developing projects to reduce socioeconomic disparities across the cancer continuum from prevention to end-of-life care.   Through this work, he plans to identify the socioeconomic pathways contributing to cancer disparities and to design innovate interventions that help individuals better manage and leverage their socioeconomic and psychosocial resources for improved health.               A more comprehensive view of socioeconomic status (SES) may help us better understand how SES is actually experienced and how it affects prostate cancer treatment and outcomes.  Our limited knowledge about both the subjective and objective mechanisms through which socioeconomic experience impacts cancer treatment constrains our understanding of the factors that contribute to cancer disparities.  Expanding our conceptualization of SES to include material and psychosocial aspects of individual socioeconomic circumstances may help us begin to unpack the complex association between socioeconomic circumstances and the various types of prostate cancer treatment selected and adherence to treatment.

"Circadian Genes and Aggressive Prostate Cancer in Caucasians and African American     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality rates for prostate cancer in the world and are more than twice as likely to die of prostate cancer as their Caucasian counterparts. Reasons for this racial disparity are unknown. Recently, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified circadian rhythm disruption as a probable cause of cancer based on epidemiologic data suggesting that shift work involving circadian disruptions may be associated with higher risk of cancers, including that of the prostate. Within the body, circadian rhythms are controlled by 15 known circadian-related genes. Variations in these genes have been shown to influence androgen metabolism and energy balance, which are thought to contribute to the development of prostate cancer. It has also been shown that haplotype patterns in one of the circadian genes differ significantly between Africans and non-Africans. We hypothesize that variation in circadian genes affects the risk of prostate cancer, in particular aggressive prostate cancer, in both Caucasians and African Americans, and that the relationship between circadian gene variants and aggressive prostate cancer risk may differ between the two ethnic groups, thereby contributing to the disparity of aggressive prostate cancer in these two groups. To test these hypotheses, we are collaborating with the African American Prostate Cancer (AAPC) Genetic Consortium and the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) in using existing genetic data (2,700 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 15 genes) from these two consortium studies (4,000 aggressive prostate cancer cases and 9,500 controls) for a comprehensive statistical analysis. Of the 13,500 subjects included in the study, about 1,200 cases and 5,000 healthy controls are African American men from the AAPC study and 2,800 cases and 4,500 healthy controls are Caucasian men from the BPC3 study. We plan to conduct statistical analyses to: 1) determine if variation in circadian genes are associated with risk of aggressive prostate cancer in Caucasians and African Americans; and 2) determine whether the association between circadian gene variants and prostate cancer risk differs between Caucasians and African Americans and whether this difference explains part of the racial disparity in prostate cancer risk. This is the first study t have a large number of aggressive prostate cancer cases, especially from African Americans, with extensive SNP coverage of circadian genes. This study is therefore able to provide insight into the role of circadian genes in prostate cancer and whether these genes contribute to the racial disparity of prostate cancer rates between Caucasians and African Americans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans have the highest prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates in the world. They are also more than twice as likely to die of prostate cancer as their Caucasian counterparts. Identifying novel risk factors, such as circadian gene variants, can help clarify reasons for the racial disparity in aggressive prostate cancer between Caucasian and African American men, which may be useful in developing strategies for prostate cancer prevention to minimize the burden of prostate cancer in both Caucasian and African Americans.            ",Circadian Genes and Aggressive Prostate Cancer in Caucasians and African American,8639511,R03CA176767,"['Affect ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' diurnal variation ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' circadian ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Caucasians ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Anabolism ', ' Evaluation ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Prostate CA Prevention ', ' prostate cancer prevention ', ' Genetic ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' cancer risk ', ' energy balance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Sampling ', ' Androgen Metabolism ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' High-Risk Cancer ', ' IARC ', ' International Agency for Research on Cancer ', ' attributable fraction ', ' Population Attributable Risks ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Extraprostatic ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' night work ', ' night shift ', ' day shift ', ' shift work ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' ']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R03,2014,72265,0.3843471241874603
"3rd Biennial Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (CaP) is the second most common cancer in men globally and the most common male cancer in Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America. While all Black men are disproportionately affected by CaP, African American and Jamaican men have been noted to have the highest rate of CaP in the world. To better understand and effectively address the disproportionate burden of CaP in Black men, it is important to explore CaP among Black men globally for the following reasons: [1] the ancestral link among Black men, especially those connected by the Transatlantic Slave Trade; and [2] the growing literature on the disproportionate burden of CaP among Black men of West African ancestry in the Caribbean, the United Kingdom, and West Africa. The Biennial Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men Conference offers the opportunity for CaP scientists, clinicians, advocates, and survivors all over the world to come together to address the global burden of CaP among Black men. The 3rd biennial conference uniquely focuses on making progress in conquering prostate cancer in Black men through CORE elements, including Community Outreach, Research, and Education & Training. The agenda has been uniquely designed to foster effective interactions among all delegates, educate, and facilitate immediate dissemination of the science to survivors and advocates. The conference will take place in Montego Bay, Jamaica because of the significant burden of CaP in Jamaican men. In addition, the location offers excellent facilities for meetings and tourism. The conference will be held November 5-8, 2014. The primary hosts for the conference are the University of Florida and the University of West Indies, with co-sponsorship by the Prostate Cancer Transatlantic Consortium (CaPTC), African-Caribbean Cancer Consortium (AC3) and Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate (MADCaP) Consortium. There is significant collaborative support through several other national and international organizations, including the: African Organization for Research and Training in Cancer (AORTIC), Caribbean Urological Association (CURA), Jamaica Cancer Society, Prostate Net(R), Central Florida Pharmacy Council (CFPC), and Tanzania 50 Plus campaign.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The 3rd Biennial conference on ""The Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men"" is proposed to bring prostate cancer scientists, clinicians, survivors, and advocates together to share cross cutting prostate cancer research issues and develop the next priorities for research, education and community outreach to achieve prostate health equity globally.                ",3rd Biennial Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men,8784696,R13CA189451,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Awareness ', ' Bahamas ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Europe ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' Island ', ' Jamaica ', ' Literature ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' North America ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Slave ', ' Societies ', ' Tanzania ', ' Training Programs ', ' United Kingdom ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Caribbean Islands ', ' West Indies ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Advocacy ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' urological ', ' urologic ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' African ', ' Fostering ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' infectious organism ', ' Infectious Agent ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' African Caribbean ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' carcinoma prostatic cancer ', ' Prostatic carcinoma ', ' Prostate carcinoma ', ' Participant ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Indigenous ', ' International ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Research Training ', ' 8q24 ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Community Practice ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' risk variant ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R13,2014,45000,0.2924458644133447
"CANCER RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. African- American men are disproportionately impacted by prostate cancer and exhibit the highest incidence and mortality rate in the world. The underlying reasons for significant prostate cancer health disparities in African- American men are not clearly understood and may include both biological and socio-economic factors. The RCMl program has helped Clark Atlanta University (CAU) to establish the Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD), a premier research program in prostate cancer. CCRTD focuses on understanding prostate cancer health disparities and has successfully trained the next generation of minority scientists in the area of prostate cancer and developed a community-based educational and research program focusing on the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. In this RCMl renewal application, we propose to enhance, improve and manage our research programs to increase efficient use of technologies, increase research capacity and competitiveness and expand our network through collaborations and partnerships with researchers, research institutes and community organizations. We propose the following specific aims to achieve our goals: 1) To recruit and support additional scientists to build a competitive basic and translational research center focused on prostate cancer health disparities and 2) To maintain and expand the existing research infrastructure within CCRTD. To achieve the specific aims, we plan to focus on two primary activities: a) Administrative Core Activity and b) Technologies and Resources for Core Laboratories Activity.

"Provider Characteristics and Quality of Prostate Cancer Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Assessment of comparative effectiveness of treatment is essential to achieve optimal quality of care [1-2]. Quality of care in healthcare is a multifaceted issue that involves factors related to patient, provider, health care system, community and environment [1-16]. Disparities exist in the quality of prostate cancer care across geographic regions, hospitals, age and racial and ethnic groups [17-23], including treatment variability among comparable patients [17-19, 24-27]. The objective of our study is to analyze the complex interplay of personal factors, clinical factors, provider factors and their relationship with variation in quality of care and heterogeneity of treatment among men with prostate cancer (localized or advanced). Specific aims are: (1): To assess the contribution of provider (hospital and physician) characteristics in the observed disparities (race/ethnicity and disability status) in process of care (type of treatment, time to treatment and diagnostic procedures), and outcomes (short-term and long-term), among prostate cancer patients; (2) To assess the contribution of patient and provider characteristics in the heterogeneous treatment effects among prostate cancer patients; (3) To assess the contribution of continuity of care to the disparity in quality of care (process of care and outcomes) and the heterogeneous treatment effects among prostate cancer patients. To accomplish these aims, we propose a retrospective cohort control design study using the SEER-Medicare linked data. All African American, Asian, Hispanic, and Caucasian men, diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1995 and 2012 (n=282,487) will be identified and followed retrospectively for one year pre-diagnosis and up to fifteen years post-diagnosis. Physician and hospital characteristics will be determined by linkage to the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Hospital Association (AHA) annual survey, respectively. Our main comparators are various treatments for localized or advanced prostate cancer. We will use multilevel modeling approach. First, we will study the association of hospital characteristics with racial and ethnic disparity in process of care and outcomes. Next, we will analyze the contribution made by physician characteristics to racial and ethnic disparity in process of care and outcomes. Finally, we will investigate the role played by continuity of care in the observed racial and ethnic disparity in process of care and outcomes. We will use propensity score and instrumental variable approaches to minimize measured and unmeasured biases. Our study proposes a novel systems approach for analyzing the complex interplay of provider characteristics and their relationship with racial and ethnic disparities in process of care and outcomes among prostate cancer patients. The study results will aid in development of micro and macro level treatment, care and payment policies to address disparity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Assessment of comparative effectiveness of treatment is essential to achieve optimal quality of care. Quality of care in healthcare is a multifaceted issue that involves factors related to patient, provider, health care system, community and environment.

The objective of our study is to analyze the complex interplay of personal factors, clinical factors, provider factors and their relationship with variaion in quality of care and heterogeneity of treatment among men with prostate cancer (localized or advanced) using SEER-Medicare, AMA and AHA databases.            ",Provider Characteristics and Quality of Prostate Cancer Care,8944336,R01HS024106,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,243325,0.30342612778702294
"Chemical markers of heterocyclic aromatic amines for human biomonitoring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and second leading cause of cancer-related death among men in the United States. Identifying risk factors of this disease and developing strategies for prevention are critical. A number of epidemiologic studies have reported an association between frequent consumption of well-done cooked meats, containing the heterocyclic aromatic amine (HAA) 2-amino-1-methyl- 6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and prostate cancer risk. PhIP is a potent rodent prostate carcinogen, and it induces oxidative stress, atrophy of the acini, and inflammation of the prostate. These are critical features that occur in human prostate carcinogenesis. A paradigm has been put forth for a causal role of consumption of well-done cooked meats containing PhIP (and other HAAs) in the etiology of prostate cancer; however, biomarkers of exposure and DNA damage are lacking to validate this model.  Our long-term goal is to assess the cancer risk posed by HAAs, by employing chemical markers that may distinguish individuals at different levels of risk. In this grant renewal, our objective is to assess dietary exposure to PhIP and its potential to induce damage to DNA in the prostate in relation to other HAAs, meat genotoxicants, and endogenous electrophiles produced in the cell, by employing mass spectrometric (MS)- based methods to measure genotoxicants and identify their biomarkers of DNA damage in the prostate.  We will implement our recently established biomarkers of HAAs and other cooked meat genotoxicants and their DNA adduction products in cohorts of African American and Caucasian men with benign prostate hyper- plasia or prostate cancer who frequently eat well-done cooked meat. In Aim 1) HAA exposure will be assessed by measurement of HAAs accrued in hair; DNA adducts of HAAs, other meat genotoxicants, and endogenous electrophiles, will be determined by different MS scanning methods, in prostate. In Aim 2) Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded prostate tissue, an underutilized biospecimen in biomonitoring DNA damage, will be employed to screen for HAA-DNA adducts in subjects undergoing prostatectomy. Adduct levels will be compared to those values obtained by current but non-specific immunohistochemical techniques. MS methods will also be implemented to measure PhIP-serum albumin adducts as long-lived biomarkers of the biologically effective dose. In Aim 3) we will conduct high density genotyping of genes encoding enzymes involved carcinogen metabolism that may impact DNA damage in the prostate. Prostate HAA-DNA adduct levels will be correlated to HAA levels in hair; the levels of HAA and other DNA adducts in prostate will be correlated to genotypes of phase I and II xenobiotic metabolism enzymes, which impact biological activity.  Our findings will provide direct measurement of DNA damage and assess the relative contribution of HAAs, other cooked meat genotoxicants and endogenous electrophiles to the genetic damage of DNA in the prostate. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cooking of meat well-done produces heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), which are prostate carcinogens in experimental animals and potential human carcinogens. The quantitative measurement of HAA exposure and identification of mutation-prone DNA adducts of HAAs in the human prostate would strengthen the biological plausibility for a role of HAAs in the etiology of prostate cancer. With these data in hand, educational and primary cancer prevention efforts may be devised because there are methods of cooking meats that do not lead to substantial formation of hazardous HAAs.",Chemical markers of heterocyclic aromatic amines for human biomonitoring,8920031,R01CA122320,"['epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Animals ', ' benign prostate hyperplasia ', ' Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ', ' Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cells ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA Injury ', ' DNA Damage ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Enzymes ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lipid Peroxidation ', ' Meat ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatectomy ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Serum Albumin ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' PhIP ', ' 2-Amino-1-Methyl-6-Phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Second Primary Neoplasms ', ' Second Neoplasm ', ' Second Malignancy ', ' Metachronous Second Primary Neoplasms ', ' Metachronous Neoplasms ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Carcinogen-DNA Adducts ', ' DNA Adducts ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' cooking ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' human tissue ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' beef ', ' adduct ', ' cancer risk ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism Detection ', ' Polymorphism Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' acinus ', ' Acinus organ component ', ' Formalin ', ' Xenobiotic Metabolism ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Dose ', ' DNA Adduct Formation ', ' DNA Adduction ', ' Data ', ' red meat consumption ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Primary Cancer Prevention ', ' Carcinogen Metabolism ', ' Monitor ', ' feeding ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' volunteer ', ' heterocyclic aromatic amines ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' prostate tumorigenesis ', ' prostate carcinogenesis ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2015,595628,0.30361774924327717
"METABOLOMIC PROFILING AND BIOLOGIC BASIS OF RACIAL DISPARITY IN PROSTATE CANCER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of our research plan is to reduce the disproportionate effects of prostate cancer on African American men. A guiding principle of our methodology is biochemical differences exist between prostate cancers of African American and European American origin and that these differences can explain, in part, prostate cancer health disparity. In this application, we propose to use the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover these underlying differences. Metabolomics describes the science of quantifying the levels of metabolites (e.g., small molecules) that are the byproducts of cellular metabolism. That is to say, in this kind of analysis we are measuring the biochemical entities (or metabolites) that are produced by the functional machinery of the cell. With knowledge of the identity of specific metabolites we can infer the biological processes that produced them, thus gaining insight into a cell's metabolism. To date, a metabolomic analysis of prostate cancer health disparity has not been reported. In preliminary studies, we have profiled the metabolome of prostate cancers from African-American and European American men and have identified specific racially distinct metabololites as well as biological pathways associated with each. In this proposal, we will i) validate and refine the metabolomic profile of prostate cancers from African American and European American men, ii) evaluate the role of specific biochemical pathways in prostate cancers of African American and European American men and iii) develop urine based metabolic markers for high risk prostate cancer in African American and European American men. At the conclusion of this study, we will have developed a racially derived metabolomic model for prostate cancer as well as identified candidate pathways for future drug targeting. At present, it is not known how the prostate cancer metabolome contributes to health disparities. The information gleaned from this proposal could rapidly revolutionize current diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches by revealing the biological underpinnings of prostate cancer health

"CANCER RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. African- American men are disproportionately impacted by prostate cancer and exhibit the highest incidence and mortality rate in the world. The underlying reasons for significant prostate cancer health disparities in African- American men are not clearly understood and may include both biological and socio-economic factors. The RCMl program has helped Clark Atlanta University (CAU) to establish the Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD), a premier research program in prostate cancer. CCRTD focuses on understanding prostate cancer health disparities and has successfully trained the next generation of minority scientists in the area of prostate cancer and developed a community-based educational and research program focusing on the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. In this RCMl renewal application, we propose to enhance, improve and manage our research programs to increase efficient use of technologies, increase research capacity and competitiveness and expand our network through collaborations and partnerships with researchers, research institutes and community organizations. We propose the following specific aims to achieve our goals: 1) To recruit and support additional scientists to build a competitive basic and translational research center focused on prostate cancer health disparities and 2) To maintain and expand the existing research infrastructure within CCRTD. To achieve the specific aims, we plan to focus on two primary activities: a) Administrative Core Activity and b) Technologies and Resources for Core Laboratories Activity. Under the Administrative Core Activity, our key focus areas will be i) Collaborations and Partnerships; ii) Professional Development Activities; iii) Evaluation Plan; iv) Recruitment and Hiring of Additional Faculty Investigators/Research Staff; and v) Pilot Project Program.

"Racial disparity of MIC-1 gene in prostate tumor biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer health disparities represent a major public health concern in the United States. Even when socioeconomic factors are accounted for, minority populations have higher overall incidence rates and worse outcomes than the overall population. Prostate cancer is one of such disease with higher incidence and death rate in African American (AA) men than Caucasians. Although socioeconomic factors may be blamed to a certain extent, it is being appreciated that the differences in tumor biology make AA men more prone to the aggressive prostate cancer. Therefore, understanding the impact of biological variability in prostate cancer is vital to reduce the observed cancer outcome gaps between AA men and Caucasians. Our goal is to determine the role of macrophage inhibitory cytokine (MIC-1) as a biological factor that play a critical role in prostate tumor biology leading to cancer heath disparities. MIC-1 has drawn significant attention due to its increased association with the development and progression of prostate cancer, and increasing serum MIC-1 levels correlates with the presence of bone metastasis. Preliminary data from our laboratory clearly demonstrate that serum MIC-1 in prostate cancer patients is significantly higher in AA men than Caucasians. We hypothesize that increased level of MIC-1 in prostate tumor microenvironment of African American men contributes to an increase in prostate cancer health disparity. To date the role of MIC-1 to differentiate the aggressive prostate cancer among AA men and Caucasians has not been investigated. To test the above hypothesis, our specific Aims are: 1) To determine the clinical significance of MIC-1 in prostate cancer health disparity among African American men and Caucasians; and 2) To determine the mechanism of MIC-1 in immune surveillance leading to prostate cancer disparity using mouse models. Using the skills of multidisciplinary team of investigators, we will measure serum MIC-1 levels in prostate cancer patients with recurrent metastasis, and newly diagnosed prostate cancer. We will also analyze the stromal and epithelial expression of MIC-1 in archival specimens of human prostate tumor tissues from AA men and Caucasians. We will determine the mechanistic role of MIC-1 regulating aggressive prostate cancer by analyzing the nature of infiltrating lymphocytes using immuno- competent mouse models. Clearly, the serum MIC-1 levels differ in AA men and Caucasians with prostate cancer. This will have a significant impact to establish the biological role of MIC-1 contributing o prostate cancer health disparity for its subsequent translation into clinics to reduce the sufferin of African American men with prostate cancer using improved therapeutic treatment modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Given the facts of a significant racial disparity in prostate cancer among African American (AA) men and Caucasians, there is an utmost need to understand the prostate tumor biology. Apart from socioeconomic factors, AA men clearly differ from Caucasians on a number of accounts, including genetic predisposition, which favors for high incidence and mortality rate for prostate cancer development. Preliminary data from our laboratory clearly demonstrate that serum MIC-1 (macrophage inhibitory cytokine) in prostate cancer patients was significantly higher in AA men than Caucasians. Therefore, we propose to determine that MIC-1 plays a vital role in regulating prostate tumor biology resulting in racial disparity.

"CNTR OF EXCELLENCE FOR PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH EDUCATION AND COMM SERVICE The Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD) was established in 1999 at Clark  Atlanta University to carry-out basic research in cancer biology and drug discovery. In 2004, the CCRTD  decided to concentrate in the area of prostate cancer due to disproportionately higher incidence and  mortality rate of this disease in African-American men. The current proposal requests support to continue the  Center of Excellence in Prostate Cancer Research, Education and Community Education. The main  objectives of this center will be 1) To carry out high quality basic research in cell and molecular biology of  prostate cancer and to identify underlying biological reasons for racial disparities, 2) To continue our training  program for undergraduate and graduate students to provide research training in the area of prostate cancer  and hence increase the number of minority (primarily African American) scientists in this area of research, 3)  To expand the community-based educational program for raising awareness on prevention, screening, early  detection and treatment of prostate cancer. These goals will be achieved in collaboration with the Clark  Atlanta University Division of Communication Arts, Midtown Urology Educational Foundation, Saint Joseph's  Hospital Men's Health and Wellness Center, and other community organizations. In the Research Core, we  propose three research projects focusing on prostate cancer cell and molecular biology and racial disparities.  In the Training Core, we are requesting support for training of four graduate and six undergraduate students  in the area of cancer biology and community service. In the Community Outreach/Education Core, we are  requesting support to expand upon the community outreach and educational activities to include a larger  media arena and coverage. The overall activities of the center will be monitored by the Administrative Core.  The activities of the Administrative Core will be overseen by the Institutional (lAC), External (EAC) and Local  External (LEAC) Advisory Committees. The long term goals of the center will be to understand the biology of  prostate cancer, to increase the number of African-American scientists in cancer research, and to educate  the African-American community in the areas of prostate cancer prevention, early detection and treatment. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Prostate cancer affects the African-American community disproportionately. There is an increased  incidence/mortality rate for African-American men, however the reason for this is unknown.

"Comprhensive Center of Excellence in Health Disparities This Center of Excellence (COE) is being submitted to address significant gaps in our knowledge about disparities prostate cancer (PCa) outcomes, and to develop interventions that can be applied to reduce these disparities between African (AA) and European (EA) Americans in Philadelphia. The mission of the proposed center is to (1) undertake research that will identify biological, behavioral, social, environmental, geospatial, physical environmental, and health care factors that influence PCa outcomes, and (2) integrate, evaluate, and disseminate this information to at-risk populations in Philadelphia communities. These factors include both individual and area-level contextual (e.g., neighborhood) variables. We anticipate that the principles of this approach will ultimately be implementable in other communities to reduce PCa disparities.   This COE builds on our existing multidisciplinary research to specifically understand role of biomarkers, patterns of care, geospatial environment, and obesity after the diagnosis of PCa. This research requires transdisciplinary collaboration across multiple disciplines represented by the investigators participating in this COE. The proposed COE intends to catalyze needed improvements in the identification of men at greatest risk of unfavorable PCa outcomes to improve access to appropriate PCa treatment with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To conduct three highly interrelated transdisciplinary, translational research projects aimed at addressing prostate cancer disparities: a) Project 1: Evaluate the role of obesity in determining unfavorable prostate cancer outcomes (C. Zeigler-Johnson, PI); Project 2: Develop predictive models for understanding biomarkers, area-level contextual factors, and individual risk factors in predicting prostate cancer outcomes (T. Rebbeck, PI); Project 3: Determine whether variation in experienced and potential health care access and quality contributes to racial differences in treatment among men with localized prostate cancer (K. Armstrong, PI). Aim 2. To create specialized shared resource cores to serve the needs of these projects and the Center, including an Administrative Core (T. Rebbeck, Director); a research core (J. Holmes and C. Branas, co-Directors); and a community core (K. Glanz, Director). Aim 3: To develop transdisciplinary training at a variety of levels to train the next generation of health disparities researchers. Through this research, community outreach, and training, we will develop a program that can identify those groups at greatest risk for an unfavorable prostate cancer outcome, and develop approaches that can be used to minimize poor outcomes and the resulting disparities that unduly burden AA men. The proposed center of excellence will integrate the knowledge obtained in our previous research  experience to develop, evaluate, and begin to implement interventions aimed at reducing prostate cancer  disparities that affect African American men in Philadelphia.",Comprhensive Center of Excellence in Health Disparities,8820825,P60MD006900,"['Affect ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mission ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Development Plans ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' American ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Improve Access ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' data modeling ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' evidence base ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P60,2015,1327473,0.25557141544477413
"Multidiciplinary Integrative Genomic Approach to Distinguish Lethal from Indolent Prostate Cancer in Men of Europena and African Ancestry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are several critical unmet needs in the management of localized prostate cancer. Central among them is the development of minimally invasive tools to distinguish localized cancers that are truly indolent from cancers that are progressive and potentially lethal. To address this key need, we first propose to perform an integrated, multi-dimensional genomic, epigenomic and expression analysis to uncover novel molecular pathways that characterize indolent vs. aggressive prostate cancers. In this approach we define indolent tumors as those screen detected (e.g. PSA screening) lesions that are Gleason score 6 (or less) that are organ confined at radical prostatectomy. We consider these tumors indolent as they do not appear capable of metastasis. In contrast, we equate Gleason score 8-10 tumors as ""interval"" or symptomatic since, even with primary treatment, these tumors often recur and metastasize at high frequencies. Additionally, we will validate our key markers/pathways discovered in this project using additional populations with long term outcomes. We hypothesize that our multi-modality genomic-based integrated approach, contrasting these two divergent tumor types, will reveal signatures that distinguish cancers with dichotomous phenotypes. We also hypothesize that these signatures will vary based on race and thus in parallel we will comprehensively characterize African American prostate cancers to reveal molecular features driving racial disparities in outcomes. We will validate the signatures obtained using large cohorts of cases with established outcomes including: (1) the Johns Hopkins Active surveillance cohort and (2) Prostate cancer cases from the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), an observational cohort of men followed since 1954 with autopsy documented indolent or aggressive/lethal disease. We also propose that these signatures will be able to predict outcomes of cancers with indeterminate kinetics and propose to test this through analysis of cases of intermediate risk prostate cancer with long-term follow-up and known outcomes from Johns Hopkins and in collaboration with colleagues from Harvard, from the Physician's Health and Health Professionals follow-up studies. Together this work will yield highly relevant information that can be directly applied to the clinical management of localized prostate cancer. Specifically, it will yield an integrated signature that distinguishes localized - indolent tumors from localized tumors with lethal potential. Additionally we believe these signatures will be critical in determining treatment strategies for individuals with prostate cancers of indeterminate kinetics.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The key unmet need in the management of prostate cancers pivots around the dilemma of the screen detected tumor as clinicians balance over treating cancers that are indolent with delaying/under-treating cancers that are aggressive and pose harm. Nomograms containing clinical and pathologic variables are helpful but additional minimally invasive methods are needed to improve their predictive capabilities. This project, which will comprehensively characterization prostate cancers and their microenvironment from both Caucasian and African American men, will inform unique pathways that modulate these two states and allow the development of novel minimally invasive tools that improve patient care.              ",Multidiciplinary Integrative Genomic Approach to Distinguish Lethal from Indolent

"Genome-wide sequencing of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men have two times or more the incidence rate of prostate cancer than other U.S. populations, and high rates of prostate cancer are also seen in other African and African-derived populations. It is generally accepted that both common and rare genetic variants contribute to risk of complex diseases such as prostate cancer, however their relative contributions to overall heritability is a subject of intense controversy. For rare variants to have a significant influence on the risk of complex disease the spectrum of effect sizes must be considerably larger in magnitude than for common variants; to date however there is only limited evidence for or against this hypothesis since the means of comprehensively testing rare variation in the genome has not been possible until very recently. In this proposal we seek to test the contributions of both common and rare genetic variants to the risk of prostate cancer in men of American ancestry using a targeted genome-wide association study approach. In Aim 1 we plan to sequence (at 30x coverage) the exome and regulatory regions (~160 Mb) of the genome, as defined by epigenetic marks in prostate cancer cell lines, in 1,000 men of African ancestry (500 with aggressive disease) and 1,000 controls. Both single SNP and burden of rare variants analyses will be performed and replication testing of the most statistically significant sequence variations (~24,000) will be examined in additional samples of African ancestry (6,000 cases and 6,000 controls) through the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer (AAPC) consortium. In addition to association testing of single variants, we will conduct ""burden of rare variants analyses"" of coding and non-coding variants at the gene and pathway level. In Aim 2, we will examine interactions between associated variants, environmental factors (thereby better defining the role of these factors) and disease severity. In Aim 3, we will assess biological function of the novel risk alleles identified in Aim 1 using a staged approach of eQTL analysis followed by in vitro analyses of enhancer activity as well as allele-specific effects. This proposal spans the spectrum of genetic epidemiologic research in prostate cancer, from genetic discovery (for all prostate cancer as well as aggressive disease) to gene environment interaction testing, to biological understanding. We expect this work to significantly advance knowledge of the etiology of prostate cancer and racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer risk, and to guide the development of future preventive, early detection, prognostic and even therapeutic measures. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, we will conduct targeted genome-wide sequencing in men of African ancestry to reveal genetic markers that may contribute to their greater risk of prostate cancer. We expect findings from this study will make a major contribution to our understanding of genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer and the genetic basis underlying familial aggregation and heritability of this common cancer. Identifying more genetic predictors of risk will have widespread applicability and significance, leading to better risk models to more accurately predict a man's risk of developing prostate cancer, and better intensive screening and preventive strategies that target men at high risk.",Genome-wide sequencing of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry,8894463,R01CA165862,"['Accounting ', '

"(PQC3) Using an Immunoscore to Assess Tumor-medicated Immune Variations in African -American DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite a body of evidence demonstrating the importance of the tumor-mediated immune response to the outcome of prostate cancer patients, no studies have adequately evaluated the tumor-mediated immune response in African American patients. Given that the African American race is a risk factor for more aggressive and lethal prostate cancer, the purpose of this study is to test the overall hypothesis that difference in the quantity and localization of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes into the prostate gland correlat with PCa racial health disparities and that androgen signaling regulates this process.  For this study, we will utilize a prostate tissue biorepository collected between 2003 and 2013, containing over 6,500 archival prostate cancer specimens, 25% (1,630) of which are from African American men. To test our hypothesis in a definitive way, we will utilize the concept of an ""immunoscore."" The immunoscore, a combined score based on the quantitation of CD3+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in a tumor, has already been found to be a strong predictive indicator in patients with colorectal cancer and is only starting to be explored for other solid tumor types. In our Specific Aim 1, we will adapt existing immunoscoring methodology to be compatible with and applicable to prostate cancer, and will test the reproducibility and robustness of calculating the prostate cancer immunoscore in a small, preliminary panel of African American and Caucasian patients from our tissue bank. In our Specific Aim 2, we will determine the prostate cancer immunoscore and androgen receptor status in a large cohort of African American (1,630) and Caucasian (1,630) patients, for which we also have 10-year follow-up data. We will then be able to determine if differences exist between African Americans and Caucasians with respect to: prostate cancer immunoscores, the spectrum/quantity of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+), and/or androgen receptor status; and if race is predictive of any of these variables. In our Specific Aim 3, we will perform Cox regression analysis and statistical modeling to determine if the prostate cancer immunoscore and/or AR status are predictors of long-term clinical outcomes (biochemical recurrence and/or disease-specific mortality) in African American and/or Caucasian patients with localized prostate cancer. If so, we will be able to construct an immunoscore-based classifier that clinicians can use to better predict outcome in their African American patients with prostate cancer-something that currently doesn't exist and is desperately needed.

"A Network Analytic Approach to Modeling Variation in Prostate Cancer Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unexplained variation in the clinical management of prostate cancer is recognized as an important problem in cancer treatment. To investigate potential explanations for this variation, the proposed project uses a social network analytic approach to model the connections that exist between physicians caring for patients with prostate cancer. This approach explicitly recognizes the clinical reality that many patients face: they see multiple physicians for their screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care across a range of clinical venues and at various times. Not only does each physician contribute to the type and quality of care patients receive but also the relationships between physicians within a geographical region may be an important and modifiable determinant of care. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to map the connections between PCPs, urologists, and radiation oncologists as a network and examine whether specialists' positions in the network structure are related to their patient's prostate cancer treatment; (2) to determine whether the network structure helps explain observed differences in prostate cancer treatment between black and white men; and (3) to investigate the determinants of the network structure through a survey of PCPs about their referral decisions. To achieve these aims, this project uses SEER-Medicare claims data and a survey of PCPs. The SEER- Medicare sample consists of men with localized prostate cancer diagnosed from 1995-2005 and their associated PCP and specialist providers. The position of specialists in the cancer care networks will be quantitatively determined and the positions will be related to patient-level variation in the type and quality of cancer care and to racial differences in care. The survey of PCPs will elucidate the factors important in their referral decisions. Understanding observed variations may suggest ways that the network structure may be leveraged to improve quality in cancer care and reduce disparities in outcomes. The candidate, Craig Pollack, MD, MHS is an Assistant Professor in the Division of General Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine with a joint appointment in the Department of Epidemiology and membership in the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. His long-term goal is to become an independent, grant-funded health services researcher in the field of cancer control. His short-term goals are to develop expertise in cancer prevention and control, network analysis, advanced health services research methods, and organizational theory and provider behavior. Dr. Pollack has assembled a mentoring team that includes national leaders in cancer research, urological cancer, health disparities, and network analysis. The proposed project provides Dr. Pollack with the training, mentoring, and resources to become a successful independent investigator dedicated to improving cancer care. Project Narrative Though prostate cancer is very common among older men, there exists a great deal of variation in how patients with early disease get treated. Using a technique called social network analysis, we examine how the connections and referral patterns between primary care physicians and specialists may influence the type, quality and equity of care that men receive.",A Network Analytic Approach to Modeling Variation in Prostate Cancer Care,8881110,K07CA151910,"['Affect ', ' Appointment ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health behavior ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Urologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Urological Cancer ', ' Urinary Tract Cancer ', ' Malignant Urinary Tract Neoplasm ', ' Urologic Cancer ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Radiation Oncologist ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Collection ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' working group ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' older men ', ' effective intervention ', ' Medicare claim ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K07,2015,156570,0.26712657279359514
"Racial differences in CYP1B1 polymorphisms and risks for prostate cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the USA, African-American (AfA) men have higher incidence and death rates due to prostate cancer when compared to Caucasians (Cau). The reasons for this discrepancy are unknown but studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1), a gene that activates carcinogens, to be involved in prostate cancer pathogenesis. The goal of this project is to determine if CYP1B1 SNPs are risk factors for race-related prostate cancer and we hypothesize that these variants: 1) differ between AfA and Cau, 2) contribute to race-related prostate cancer and its progression, (3) are associated with prostate tissue levels, and (4) cause differences in enzyme levels and activity. Two specific aims are proposed to achieve the goals of the project. Aim #1 will investigate whether SNPs of CYP1B1 are risk factors for race- related prostate cancer. Blood DNA and prostate tissue will be collected from AfA and Cau patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and various stages and grades of prostate cancer; as well as blood DNA from age- matched, healthy male volunteers. The following experiments will be performed: (a) SNPs in the CYP1B1 promoter and coding region will be determined by sequence-specific PCR and direct genomic sequencing. The correlation of CYP1B1 SNPs and haplotypes with race and prostate cancer susceptibility and progression will be determined. (b) Localization of CYP1B1 in BPH and cancer tissues will be monitored by immunohistochemistry. By cross-referencing SNPs and haplotypes, the effects of polymorphisms on tissue CYP1B1 levels will be determined. In Aim #2, the mechanistic effects of CYP1B1 SNPs identified in Aim #1 will be investigated. The following experiments will be performed: (a) Construct CYP1B1 wildtype plasmids by cloning and generate polymorphic variants using site-directed mutagenesis, (b) Transfect promoter constructs into race-specific prostate cell lines and determine their effects on gene expression by luciferase reporter assay, (c) Transfect SNP constructs into E coli to express altered proteins and determine their enzymatic activity by utilizing a CYP1B1 assay. Successful completion of the proposed research will elucidate the (a) role of CYP1B1 polymorphisms as a risk factor and biomarker for race-related prostate cancer susceptibility and progression, and (b) effect of CYP1B1 variants on enzymatic levels and activities. Understanding the functional role of the CYP1B1 gene variants in race-specific prostate cancer will provide improved strategies for the management of this disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Prostate cancer rates in the USA are dramatically higher in African-Americans compared to Caucasians and the proposed research seeks to examine the role of cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) gene polymorphisms in racial health disparity. The proposed work investigates CYP1B1 variants as a biomarker for prostate cancer as well as novel mechanistic features of the variants at the cellular and genetic level using race-specific prostate cancer tissue and cells. This study will lead to a better understanding of the reasons for the disparity between the two groups for prostate cancer and thus, the goals of this proposal are highly relevant to public health.            ",Racial differences in CYP1B1 polymorphisms and risks for prostate cancer,8876352,R21CA185003,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' benign prostate hyperplasia ', ' Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ', ' Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' ortho-Dihydroxybenzenes ', ' o-Dihydroxybenzenes ', ' Pyrocatechols ', ' 2-hydroxyphenol ', ' 1,2-dihydroxybenzene ', ' 1,2-benzenediol ', ' Catechols ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cells ', ' Cloning ', ' P450 ', ' Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System ', ' Cytochrome P-450 ', ' Cytochrome P450 ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Enzymes ', ' E coli ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Incidence ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Luciferases ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasmids ', ' Play ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' Promotor Regions (Genetics) ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' Promoter Regions (Genetics) ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Benign ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Death Rate ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' Staging ', ' Reporter ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Genomics ', "" Co(beta)-cyano-7''-(2-methyl)adeninylcobamide "", ' factor A ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Address ', ' Blood Screening ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Monitor ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' volunteer ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' prostate tumorigenesis ', ' prostate carcinogenesis ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R21,2015,200057,0.4001719186277269
"(PQ3) AGEs and Race Specific Tumor Immune Response in Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AGEs and Race Specific Tumor Immune Response in Prostate Cancer African American (AA) prostate cancer patients are more likely to die of their disease than any other race or ethnic group in the US. Here in South Carolina (SC), age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates are 78% higher among AA men than EA men and mortality rates three times higher. While quality of care issues and socioeconomic status clearly contribute to cancer health disparities it is becoming increasing clear that molecular and genetic differences in tumor biology also play a critical role. Glycation is the non-enzymatic glycosylatio of sugars with proteins, lipids and DNA that lead to the production of reactive metabolites called advanced glycation end products (AGE's). AGEs accumulate in our tissues as we age to promote diseases associated with growing older such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Glycation occurs during normal metabolism but factors associated with cancer disparity such as poor diet and a lack of exercise significantly increase the accumulation of AGEs in our bodies. This study will conduct mechanistic research to investigate AGE accumulation as a biological consequence of the factors known to contribute to prostate cancer disparity. Our recent studies have led to our hypothesis that: ""Race specific elevations in AGEs alter tumor associated immune responses in prostate cancer"". AGEs function as a ligand activator for RAGE which is expressed on the surface of most immune cells. RAGE stimulation by AGE induces the transcriptional activation of a number of factors critical for the generation of an inflammatory environment including NFkB, STAT3 and HIF1a (4-6). Such activation results in the expression of immune associated cytokines such as IL1, IL6 and TNFa which are critical for mediating crosstalk between cancer cells and the stroma. Aim 1 will use primary and immortalized race specific cell line models to define the mechanistic implications of AGEs to the immune response. Aim 2 will use mouse models fed high and low AGE diets to determine the contribution of dietary AGEs to immune response and prostate cancer growth in vivo. The concept suggesting that AGE metabolites may represent a biological consequence of cancer disparity is a novel approach to explaining the increased incidence and mortality figures observed within specific populations. Associating the mechanistic links between glycation and altered immune response has also not been examined especially within the context of a race specific background or the prostate tumor microenvironment. By identifying a molecular consequence of cancer health disparity this study may contribute to reducing the cancer incidence and mortality rates among minority populations and identify novel potential biomarkers and define a novel area of therapeutic potential.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Factors such poor/unhealthy diet and a lack of exercise are more prevalent in African American men, increase AGE accumulation in our bodies and alter immune responses. Due to the higher complications and deaths associated with prostate cancer in African American men, a greater understanding of the mechanistic contribution of AGEs to tumor associated immune response and cancer disparity may contribute to reducing cancer incidence and mortality rates among minority populations, identify novel potential biomarkers and define a novel area of therapeutic potential. Given the potential benefits of lifestyle changes and the role of dietary-AGE in promoting disease phenotypes, opportunities exist for impacting cancer prevention initiatives arising through health and nutritional education and community outreach.            ",(PQ3) AGEs and Race Specific Tumor Immune Response in Prostate Cancer,8876216,R21CA194469,"['Age ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cells ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Metabolic Glycosylation ', ' glycosylation ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' lymphocyte activating factor ', ' T Helper Factor ', ' Macrophage Cell Factor ', ' Lymphocyte-Stimulating Hormone ', ' Interleukin I ', ' IL1 ', ' IL-1 ', ' Interleukin-1 ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Ligands ', ' Lipids ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' South Carolina ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Cultured Neoplastic Cells ', ' Cultured Tumor Cells ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' advanced glycation endproduct ', ' Advanced Glycation End Products ', ' Advanced Glycosylation End Products ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Epithelial ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' European ', ' sugar ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Figs ', ' Figs -

"Signaling Pathway Alterations in the Racial Disparity of Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men have the highest rates of prostate cancer and the death rates due to prostate cancer are two times higher than Caucasians. The reason for the disparity is still unclear, but recent scientific studies suggest that the genetic and molecular changes in different ethnics are responsible for the disparity in African American men. These changes are responsible for different clinical outcome of prostate cancer in African American. Recent preliminary study showed that differences at molecular levels in prostate tissues between African American and Caucasian do exist. Therefore, we would like to further identify the molecules associated with prostate cancer racial disparity at the protein level using our novel Proteomic Pathway Array method, and to understand the mechanism of these molecules as a cause of the health disparity for prostate cancer among African American men. The success of the proposed study will have a profound benefit on the health of men, especially African Americans. The search for molecules that can distinguish those patients who will develop aggressive prostate cancer from those who will have a less aggressive course can help to identify patients who need more close surveillance and treatment. Furthermore, the identification and functional studies of molecules responsible for the aggressive behavior of prostate cancer in African American will help to design anti-cancer drugs and strategies. The translation from the discovery from this study to clinical application (diagnosis and treatment) can be achieved at a short period of time after completion of this study. The potential contributions ofthe study to advance health disparity research will be 1) identify biomarkers for prostate cancer racial disparity, 2) provide molecular bases why there is a racial difference in prostate cancer, 3) open a brand new way to look into the causes of racial difference in prostate cancer.          This study will lead to discovery of novel signal transduction proteins involved in racial disparity of prostate cancer and will generate clinically relevant information for developing biomarkers for early detection of aggressive prostate  cancer in the African American community. The functional study of these signal transduction proteins in the context  of racial disparity may lead to development of novel treatment strategy for prostate cancer according to ethnic  background.

"Basic Cancer Research in Cancer Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common lethal tumor among US males yet little is known about its causative mechanisms. This study proposes to examine how glycosylation of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) affects steroid hormone signaling in prostate cancer. We will define the impact of SHBG glycosylation, including the D327N SHBG polymorphism, on steroid hormone associated prostate cancer risk and disparity in African and Caucasian Americans. Protein glycosylation is critical for interaction of prostate cells with its environment. We will evaluate how glycosylation of SHBG affect the distribution of the protein between plasma and tissue and how this affects disease development. The quantification of the SHBG glycoforms will be achieved by novel LC-MS assays. In addition, we will comprehensively summarize the impact of polymorphisms on N-glycosylation in the human proteome. Our hypothesis is that prostate cancer risk and progression are related to the variability in the glycosylation of SHBG. Our objective is to perform quantitative mass spectrometric assays of SHBG glycosylation in conjunction with measurement of steroid hormones. We will select men for phenotypic characterization by genotyping of a case control population with 50% African American representation. In addition, we will genotype a case series for which both serum and tissue are available. Steroid hormones will be measured by GC-MS. We will analyze the SHBG glycoforms and steroid hormones at the tissue level and in the circulation. The study is expected to fill important gaps in our understanding of prostate cancer etiology and progression. The analysis of SHBG glycoforms will provide new information on the biological factors underlying prostate carcinogenesis. The results are expected to improve prostate cancer prevention, detection and intervention strategies. This research is important because a comparative analysis of SHBG glycosylation and steroid hormones in prostate cancer, especially in African American men, has not been previously undertaken. We are proposing the first large scale examination of SHBG site occupancy in prostate cancer and health disparity of the disease.

"Novel gene that determines metastatic phenotype in African-American men with PCa ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate cancer (CaP) exhibits the most striking racial disparity, as African American men are at 1.4 times higher risk of being diagnosed and 2-3 times higher risk of dying of CaP, compared to Caucasian men. African- American men with metastatic-CaP exhibit a high rate of mortality. The impediment in identifying an effective treatment to treat this lethal condition is due to the paucity in the knowledge about the mechanism of metastatic cell growth and motility. We have identified a novel mechanism that controls growth and motility of metastatic-type tumor cells in African-American men. We provide evidence that ROBO1 (roundabout gene 1) acts as a tumor suppressor gene and important check-point that decides the fate of tumor cell-phenotype. During organogenesis, the ROBO1 is reported to regulate cell proliferation, migration and adhesion in tissues including reproductive system. Using prostatic tissues from African-American CaP patients, and cell-based model representative of CaP disease in African-American men, we show that ROBO1 is lost during metastatic condition in African-American men. We show that the difference in ROBO1 expression levels between primary and metastatic stage in African-Americans is significantly distinguishable, (while as Caucasians patients exhibit none of such distinctions between tumor stages). Furthermore, we provide evidence that ROBO1 gene- promoter is hypermethylated in African-American metastatic-CaP cells, whereas Caucasian metastatic-CaP cells do not exhibit hypermethylation of this gene. These data clearly establishes ROBO1 as a factor that distinguishes African-American CaP from Caucasian-CaP, and suggests a possible role of this gene in health disparity in African-Americans. Our proof-of principle studies showed that reactivation of ROBO1 inhibits the migration of metastatic tumor cells thus suggesting the therapeutic potential of ROBO1-pathway in CaP. Based on these data, we generated a global hypothesis that ROBO1 could act as a potential biomarker that would discriminate between primary and metastatic disease in African-American men. We suggest that ROBO1 warrants further investigation using relevant-race distinct in vitro and in vivo models. We propose three specific aims: (Aim# 1): To study the mechanism-based role of ROBO1 during the progressive stages of CaP development using a carcinogenesis cell-based model in African-American men. (Aim #2): To investigate the significance of ROBO1 as a therapeutic target for metastatic tumor growth using subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models of African-American CaP. (Aim#3): Test the relevance of tissue-ROBO1 as a biomarker for (A) disease phenotype-distinction and (B) CaP-aggressiveness in African-Americans. We believe that the successful outcome of this proposal will be extremely valuable in providing a clinically relevant phenotype- distinguishing biomarker. ROBO1 as a biomarker would help clinicians to decide if a patient should go for therapy and will be useful for African-American patients. We suggest that ROBO1 is a druggable target for treating metastatic-CaP disease in African-American men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Prostate cancer exhibits the most striking racial disparity and African-American men with metastatic prostate cancer exhibit a high rate of mortality. This proposal will be valuable in providing a (A) novel predictive biomarker and (B) druggable target for treating prostate cancer disease in African-American men.",Novel gene that determines metastatic phenotype in African-American men with PCa,8971157,R21CA184685,"['Adhesions ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Immune Precipitation ', ' Immunoprecipitation ', ' In Vitro ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Luciferases ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Athymic Nude Mouse ', ' Athymic Mice ', ' Nude Mice ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Uvomorulin ', ' Epithelial-Cadherin ', ' Epithelial Calcium-Dependent Adhesion Protein ', ' Cadherin-1 ', ' CAM 120/80 ', ' E-Cadherin ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Indolent ', ' African ', ' Organogenesis ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Staging ', ' Reporter ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Techniques ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' mutant ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' tumor growth ', ' cohort ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Prostate Carcinoma Metastatic ', ' Metastatic Prostate Cancer ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Reproductive system ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Downstream of CRK-Binding Protein, 180-kD Gene ', ' Dedicator of Cyto-Kinesis 1 Gene ', ' DOCK180 Gene ', ' DOCK1 ', ' 180-kD Gene DOCK ', ' DOCK1 gene ', ' Data ', ' Hypermethylation ', ' Prostatic Parenchyma ', ' Prostatic Tissue ', ' in vitro Model ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Prostatic ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' disease phenotype ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' chemotherapy ', ' mouse model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2015,208567,0.13623437992428725
"Modeling to Improve Prostate Cancer Outcomes Across Diverse Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. In the US, 1 in 7 men will experience a prostate cancer diagnosis in his lifetime. Identifying ways to reduce the burden of prostate cancer is therefore a top research priority. Management of prostate cancer has changed dramatically since the advent and widespread dissemination of the PSA test. Since the early 1990s, prostate cancer mortality in the US has dropped by almost half. The CISNET Prostate Working Group (PWG) was formed to use disease modeling to explain these mortality trends. The CISNET PWG has developed three models of prostate cancer natural history, detection, and survival and calibrated them against US prostate cancer trends. Results indicate that both screening and treatment changes have reduced prostate cancer deaths. However, policies must be tailored to limit harms and costs associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Different approaches for doing this have been proposed but cannot all be investigated in prospective studies. The objective of this application is to utilize and extend the CISNET PWG models to identify tailored and targeted intervention strategies that offer the most benefit while limiting harms and costs. We will determine whether we can improve screening further by using novel stratification approaches and also whether we can safely limit harms of overtreatment by judicious choices of primary and secondary therapies. These approaches will be applied in the US population and in international cancer control settings that may require modified strategies. We will provide decision makers with model access via online calculators with graphical user interfaces. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Identify active surveillance strategies that minimize patient burden without increasing risks of progression to non-curable disease or death. Aim 2: Develop stratified approaches to prostate cancer screening that target high-risk men based on polygenic risk and baseline PSA at age 45. Aim 3: Model secondary treatment strategies, their impact, and implications for population prostate cancer control. Aim 4: Determine whether racial disparities in prostate cancer mortality can be reduced by using stratified screening and treatment strategies. Aim 5: Modularize models to evaluate cancer control programs in non-US populations and collaborate with investigators in the UK and the Caribbean to develop policies for their populations and resources. Aim 6: Develop online calculators to support patient-physician decisions and policymaker deliberations about PSA screening and treatment for localized prostate cancer. These aims are highly responsive to the funding opportunity announcement, addressing 6 of the 9 targeted priority areas. Our cumulative expertise in prostate modeling, our existing models, and our close ties with clinical experts who provide access to large, high-quality datasets for model validation and calibration position us well to uniquely contribute to the national and international dialogue about how best to address and control this most common cancer in men.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative The most effective ways to prevent, treat, and manage prostate cancer remain uncertain. Our team of investigators uses a unique inter-disciplinary approach for bringing together high-quality data from a wide range of sources and developing unified models of cancer progression to answer the most critical questions. In this application, we will examine efficiency gains of screening only high-risk individuals, benefits of avoiding or delaying treatment for low-risk cancers, and feasible approaches for reducing racial disparities. This work will advance the evidence necessary to make informed decisions about screening and treatment for this most common cancer in men.            ",Modeling to Improve Prostate Cancer Outcomes Across Diverse Populations,8969577,U01CA199338,"['Age ', ' Calibration ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Europe ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Funding ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' working group ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' PSA test ', ' PSA screening ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment strategy ', ' new marker ', ' novel marker ', ' surveillance strategy ', ' prostate cancer model ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,U01,2015,1090797,0.4349953699951303
"Genetics of Prostate Cancer in Africa ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most common cancer in men of African descent worldwide. African Americans (AA) suffer from the highest rates of CaP in the world, with an average annual incidence rate of 229 per 100,000 in the period 2006-2010 (SEER). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) GLOBOCAN program estimates that CaP is also the leading cancer in terms of incidence and mortality in men from Africa and the Caribbean. AA men experience the highest rate of aggressive CaP and CaP-specific mortality of any ethnic group in the US. IARC also predicts that CaP deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will almost double from 55,522 in 2010 to 105,758 by 2030 (i.e., more than twice as many deaths as in the US). While men of African descent around the world suffer disproportionately from CaP compared to men of other races or ethnicities, our understanding of the reasons for these disparities remains incomplete. To date, few exposure, lifestyle, or environmental influences have been identified in CaP etiology. In contrast, CaP is among the most heritable of common cancers, and over 90 susceptibility loci have been identified. However, many of these loci have not been replicated in AA, in part because of limited African descent sample sizes, incomplete capture of African alleles, and a limited understanding of African genomic architecture.  To better understand the etiology of CaP in African descent men, we have initiated a large, multicenter consortium known as ""Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate"" (MADCaP). Using resources of this consortium, we propose to undertake a multicenter study of CaP in SSA addressing the following Aims:  Specific Aim 1: Genetic Susceptibility: Discover novel CaP loci and validate known CaP loci in African men to provide new information about the genetic etiology of CaP.  Specific Aim 2. Population Genomics: Evaluate how population differentiation and the recent evolutionary history of African and African American populations inform the underlying reasons for the high rates of CaP in African Americans.  This proposal will identify African alleles influence CaP risk in African populations, and will provide information about the African genome that will be of value to a wide range of genome discovery studies in CaP and other diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer is a significant and under-appreciated public health problem in Africa and represents a critical public health concern in African Americans. We propose to address these concerns by developing a multicenter collaborative structure for prostate cancer research in Africa. Using this infrastructure, we will detect novel African alleles using a genome-wide association approach, evaluate African ancestral genomic relationships and thereby gain knowledge about prostate cancer etiology relevant to men in African and across the African diaspora, including African Americans.                ",Genetics of Prostate Cancer in Africa,8888626,U01CA184374,"['Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Age ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' Language ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Natural Selections ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Genetic ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' carcinoma prostatic cancer ', ' Prostatic carcinoma ', ' Prostate carcinoma ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' IARC ', ' International Agency for Research on Cancer ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' public health relevance ', ' infrastructure development ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,U01,2015,1863488,0.26346707882784454
"Systematic Genetic Characterization of African American Prostate Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United Sates, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and African- American men have long been known to exhibit a higher incidence and increased mortality compared to men of other ethnic groups. Although socioeconomic factors and unequal access to health care undoubtedly contribute to this disparity, differences in incidence and outcome persist after adjusting for these factors. Thus, tumor biological and/or genetic aspects may underpin adverse outcomes in African-American prostate cancer. To date, however, few studies have queried the molecular biology or somatic genetics of African-American prostate cancer in-depth, meaning that our understanding of the spectrum of factors influencing these disparities remains incomplete. The over-arching goal of this proposal is to undertake a definitive somatic genetic and functional characterization of African-American prostate cancer. To accomplish this goal, we will develop a targeted, massively parallel sequencing platform that interrogates the spectrum of recurrent alterations (base mutations, chromosomal copy number changes, and selected chromosomal rearrangements) relevant to prostate cancer. We will utilize this platform to perform tumor mutation profiling in a cohort of two hundred prostate tumor specimens obtained from African American men, leveraging knowledge from prostate cancer genome sequencing studies currently ongoing at the Broad Institute and elsewhere. Patterns of somatic alterations observed in this cohort will be compared to those of European-American prostate cancer. In addition, we will test top candidate genes affected by recurrently altered prostate cancer genomic loci for effects on the tumorigenic phenotype in primary prostate epithelial cells obtained from men of European or African descent. Once completed, this project should provide decisive insights into the spectrum of and functional relevance of somatic genetic alterations in African-American prostate cancer, thereby affirming or refuting the hypothesis that these biological factors undergird this pervasive cancer health disparity.          Prostate cancer in African-American men occurs more frequently, earlier in life, and with increased lethality when compared to European Americans. Undoubtedly, the genesis of this profound disparity is multi-factorial; however, a detailed study of the genetics and biology of African-American prostate cancer has not previously been undertaken. The focus of this grant is a systematic study of recurrent somatic genetic alterations in African-American prostate cancer using targeted, massively parallel sequencing. In addition, we will query specific cancer alterations in cell culture models derived from African-American and European-American patients.

"Financial well-being following prostate cancer diagnosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer research has consistently shown evidence of racial/ethnic disparities across the cancer  continuum from detection/screening and treatment-related outcomes to mortality; and socioeconomic status  (SES) has been suggested as a substantial factor in the racial differences; yet, the research results for SES  disparities i prostate cancer-related outcomes as well as SES as an explanatory factor in racial/ethnic  disparities in prostate cancer have been inconsistent. Some have suggested that this inconsistency may be due to imprecise (and inconsistent or incomplete) measurement of socioeconomic circumstances.   Thus, there have been calls in the cancer disparities literature for greater clarity on the pathways and mechanisms causing differential cancer outcomes across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the conceptualization AND operationalization of socioeconomic circumstances in this literature.  An expanded view of the socioeconomic context for prostate cancer patients might uncover socioeconomic factors influencing disparities in treatment-related outcomes over and above the traditional SES measures; and a construct to capture this expanded socioeconomic context is financial well-being (FWB).  The  specific aims of the research project are to:  1) Develop and refine a conceptual model of the multidimensional  construct FWB using structured interviews with prostate cancer patients and a focus group with clinical social  workers; 2) Develop and pilot test a measure of FWB; 3) Evaluate the psychometric properties of the measure  of FWB and investigate the association between components of FWB, socio-demographic characteristics, and  treatment selection and adherence and perceived quality of treatment; and 4) Investigate differences in  responses to FWB items across racial/ethnic groups and evaluate potential measurement bias across  racial/ethnic groups. The successful completion of the research project will result in a valid measurement and causal model of FWB that articulates how the dimensions of FWB are related to prostate cancer treatment-related outcomes.  The candidate, Dr. Reginald Tucker-Seeley, is a Research Associate in the Center for Community Based Research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The proposed five year NCI Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) will provide the necessary mentoring, training, and research experiences in cancer care/health services, psycho-oncology, and measures/scale development to implement the proposed research project.  His long term career goal is to become an independent investigator developing projects to reduce socioeconomic disparities across the cancer continuum from prevention to end-of-life care.   Through this work, he plans to identify the socioeconomic pathways contributing to cancer disparities and to design innovate interventions that help individuals better manage and leverage their socioeconomic and psychosocial resources for improved health. A more comprehensive view of socioeconomic status (SES) may help us better understand how SES is actually experienced and how it affects prostate cancer treatment and outcomes.  Our limited knowledge about both the subjective and objective mechanisms through which socioeconomic experience impacts cancer treatment constrains our understanding of the factors that contribute to cancer disparities.  Expanding our conceptualization of SES to include material and psychosocial aspects of individual socioeconomic circumstances may help us begin to unpack the complex association between socioeconomic circumstances and the various types of prostate cancer treatment selected and adherence to treatment.",Financial well-being following prostate cancer diagnosis,8910667,K01CA169041,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Social Workers ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' psychosocial ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' DF/HCC ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' Detection ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' treatment adherence ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K01,2015,135029,0.3160355794354311
"Exploration of Cadmium as an Endocrine Disruptor in Prostate Cancer Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tremendous race disparities exist in prostate cancer incidence and mortality. Reasons for these disparities remain unknown but are likely due to both environmental and biological factors. In vitro studies suggest that the heavy metal cadmium is an endocrine disruptor of the androgen receptor. The androgen receptor is essential for normal prostate growth and development but is also the primary drug target for treatment of prostate cancer as it controls a plethora of downstream targets involved in disease progression. Previous studies indicate that compared to European-Americans, African-Americans have had higher urinary and blood cadmium levels and, have higher androgen receptor protein levels and different patterns of AR-target expression in prostate tissue. Our preliminary data (N=59) suggests that African-Americans may have higher prostate tissue cadmium levels than European-Americans. Our data also suggests that cadmium is associated with androgen receptor protein expression in prostate tumor tissue but that race modifies the association. Therefore, race differences in the association between cadmium and the androgen receptor could lead to differences in expression/signaling of downstream androgen receptor targets involved in tumor aggressiveness and disease recurrence. In this R21 study, we propose to further investigate cadmium as an endocrine disruptor of the androgen receptor by capitalizing on a well-defined, ethnically diverse cohort of prostatectomy cases (N=415, 44% AA, diagnosed 1999-2004) that originally participated in the Gene-Environment Interaction in Prostate Cancer (GECAP) (R01 ES11126) study. In prostate tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue, we will measure cadmium as well as a panel of additional toxic and essential metals that can affect cadmium toxicity. We will also measure the whole-genome transcriptome in tumor tissue. The transcriptome includes all coding and non-coding RNAs transcriptionally expressed by genes in a population of cells. We will determine whether prostate tumor tissue cadmium level is associated with androgen receptor protein expression in the larger cohort and will determine if race does indeed modify the association between cadmium and androgen receptor expression. Further, we'll determine whether prostate tumor tissue cadmium level is associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness or biochemical recurrence. In addition, we will examine the combined association of cadmium level and androgen receptor protein expression with regard to the prostate tumor transcriptome in African - and European- Americans. From our preliminary data and other existing reports, we hypothesize that race differences in the association of cadmium and the androgen receptor result in differences in expression of downstream androgen receptor targets that play a role in disease progression, and further, that these differences may in part explain race disparities in prostate cancer progression. If our hypothesis is confirmed, the GECAP data set contains an enormous resource of demographic, clinical and medical history, dietary, occupational and genetic information to investigate variables that may explain these findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cadmium is recognized as an endocrine disruptor, a human carcinogen, and an important biological hazard in the U.S. based on its toxicity and abundance. If our hypotheses are supported, this study will provide evidence that cadmium is an endocrine disruptor in the human prostate and will identify a new avenue through which race disparities in prostate cancer progression may occur. Further, our transcriptome related findings may help identify pathways to pursue in future research that could ultimately be used to tailor prostate cancer therapy rather than using broad treatment with androgen deprivation which is accompanied by a wide spectrum of negative side-effects. Most importantly, because steroid receptors have highly conserved promoter and DNA binding domains, our findings will have relevance for other diseases in which cadmium and endocrine disruption have been implicated, and in which race differences exist including breast cancer, neuroendocrinology, cardiovascular disease, thyroid disease, and metabolism and obesity.",Exploration of Cadmium as an Endocrine Disruptor in Prostate Cancer Disparities,8875692,R21ES024379,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgens ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Cd element ', ' Cadmium ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metals ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neuroendocrinology ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Play ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatectomy ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Estrogen Receptors ', ' Steroid Receptors ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Smoking ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' thyroid disorder ', ' Thyroid Gland Disorder ', ' Thyroid Gland Disease ', ' Thyroid Diseases ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' Genetic ', ' Heavy Metals ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Occupational ', ' Endocrine ', ' American ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' receptor expression ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' deprivation ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' protein expression ', ' Address ', ' DNA-Binding Protein Motifs ', ' DNA Binding Domain ', ' Data ', ' urinary ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' endocrine disrupting ', ' Endocrine disruption ', ' endocrine disrupting compound ', ' Endocrine disrupting agent ', ' Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals ', ' Endocrine Disrupter ', ' Endocrine Disruptors ', ' LNCaP ', ' Population ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' ']",NIEHS,HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM,R21,2015,186150,0.30555158297221746
"Genetic factors for race related prostate cancer. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major problem or barrier is that there are currently no methods or approaches to adequately address prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans. A major question is why do African American men have a higher overall incidence, earlier age of onset, increased proportion of clinically advanced disease and increased bone metastases and mortality from prostate cancer compared to Caucasians? The main goal of this project is to investigate the genetic basis of prostate cancer health disparities The rationale is that prostate cancer is the leading cancer among men of African descent in the USA. Despite more aggressive screening of prostate cancer across all demographics in the United States, disparities among populations persist. A substantial proportion of African American men have a higher overall incidence, earlier age of onset, increased proportion of clinically advanced disease and increased bone metastases and mortality from prostate cancer compared to Caucasians. There are racial disparities in survival after diagnosis of prostate cancer in men. Therefore, prostate cancer incidence and mortality represent a significant public health problem in African American men. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs are significantly altered in prostate cancer. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the differential expression profile of a set of oncogenic miRNAs and tumor suppressor miRNAs in African Americans may target a set of prostate cancer specific genes and may contribute to the prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans. The molecular mechanisms of action of tumor suppressor miRNAs are through repressing oncogenes and activating tumor suppressor genes. We will test these hypotheses through analyses of a series of experiments proposed under our specific aims. All the aims are highly focused, centralized, innovative, clinically significant, functional and mechanistic in nature. Specific Aim # 1. Investigate the role of miRNAs as the genetic basis of prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. Specific Aim # 2. Investigate the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of action of oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs in race-related prostate cancer. Specific Aim # 3. Investigate the molecular mechanisms of differential expression of miRNAs in African Americans and Caucasians. Impact: The present application has high impact because it describes a novel concept and approach that is different and better from the previous attempts since differential expression of a set of miRNAs may explain why African Americans have higher incidence of prostate cancer compared to Caucasians. This project will identify novel miRNAs that can be used as genetic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for race-related prostate cancer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A major question is why do African American men have a higher overall incidence, earlier age of onset, increased proportion of clinically advanced disease and increased bone metastases and mortality from prostate cancer compared to Caucasians?

"TransilienceHD: A Healthcare Professional Platform for the Elimination of Prostate Cancer Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The goals of eliminating prostate cancer (PCa) disparities remain elusive. PCa is the most common cancer in American men. African American men have a 60% higher incidence than Caucasian American men and their death rates are 2.5 times that of Caucasian and American Indians and 5 times that of Asian or Pacific Islanders.  Transformative technologies, like social media, can address PCa disparities in a completely new and innovative way. We performed an intensive competitor analysis of available online physician communities that revealed no online communities exist that solely focus on healthcare disparities. No one person has enough accurate and credible information from multiple vantage points to drive towards the elimination of today's health disparities. Hence, we have developed a collaboration platform called TransilienceHD. TransilienceHD is not simply just another social media platform; it is a powerful collaboration and ideation platform that brings experts together to inspire, promote, and deploy actionable ideas that can lead to expedited insight into chronic health diseases, and contribute to the elimination of health disparities globally. The collective intelligence of physicians, health advocacy and policy professionals, and scientists united on TransilienceHD can discuss the latest in the field, foster interdisciplinary interactions, stimulat the development of novel and innovative research, and discuss how social and economic determinants of health play a major role in PCa disparities. Another innovative feature of TransilienceHD is that it provides users with up-to-date information on relevant clinical trials. TransilienceHD also facilitates faster access to geographically dispersed physicians and health care professionals, enables efficient and effective consultative services, provides an opportunity to initiate, participate, and recruit for clinical trials, and builds a community focused on disparte PCa outcomes.  Items adapted from the Technology Acceptance Model were used to assess the acceptance and use of TransilienceHD among a diverse group of physicians, scientists, health care executives, and health policy professionals. Eighty-five percent of participants found TransilienceHD easy to use and believed it could enhance effectiveness in patient care and management. Seventy nine percent thought that TransilienceHD has the potential to make patient care and management easier and 81% believed this collaboration platform could improve patient care and management. Google Analytics revealed 1201 sessions were performed on desktop (85%), mobile (12.5%), and tablet (2.5%) devices over a 30-day period. The average pages viewed per session were 14.56 and the average session length was 11.39 minutes. Participants using their desktop computer spent an average of 12. 29 minutes per session. The universal access to the platform has the potential to improve operational inefficiencies and health care qualities by getting patients to specialists for faster diagnosis an appropriate care. Thus, the opportunity is clear and the right platform is finally here to help overcome PCa disparities by collaborating from any device, anytime.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Narrative  Disparities in prostate cancer incidence, outcome, and mortality represent one of the most unfortunate  dilemmas in healthcare.  This proposal aims to assess strategies for adoption and the usability and  impact of a webenabled collaboration platform for health care professionals and physicians.  It will also  develop a research network of physicians interested in clinical tral participation.  This novel integration  of health information technology with targeted users will e transdisciplinary and have the potential to  transform prostate cancer care and help to eliminate disparate outcomes of this condition.                    ",TransilienceHD: A Healthcare Professional Platform for the Elimination of Prostate Cancer Disparities,8996563,R43MD010258,"['Adoption ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Incidence ', ' Intelligence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Care Management ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Death Rate ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' insight ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Physician ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' ideation ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' usability ', ' public health relevance ', ' health information technology ', ' ']",NIMHD,"Q LEAP HEALTH, INC.",R43,2015,214900,0.13924022599022848
"METABOLOMIC PROFILING AND BIOLOGIC BASIS OF RACIAL DISPARITY IN PROSTATE CANCER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of our research plan is to reduce the disproportionate effects of prostate cancer on African American men. A guiding principle of our methodology is biochemical differences exist between prostate cancers of African American and European American origin and that these differences can explain, in part, prostate cancer health disparity. In this application, we propose to use the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover these underlying differences. Metabolomics describes the science of quantifying the levels of metabolites (e.g., small molecules) that are the byproducts of cellular metabolism. That is to say, in this kind of analysis we are measuring the biochemical entities (or metabolites) that are produced by the functional machinery of the cell. With knowledge of the identity of specific metabolites we can infer the biological processes that produced them, thus gaining insight into a cell's metabolism. To date, a metabolomic analysis of prostate cancer health disparity has not been reported. In preliminary studies, we have profiled the metabolome of prostate cancers from African-American and European American men and have identified specific racially distinct metabololites as well as biological pathways associated with each. In this proposal, we will i) validate and refine the metabolomic profile of prostate cancers from African American and European American men, ii) evaluate the role of specific biochemical pathways in prostate cancers of African American and European American men and iii) develop urine based metabolic markers for high risk prostate cancer in African American and European American men. At the conclusion of this study, we will have developed a racially derived metabolomic model for prostate cancer as well as identified candidate pathways for future drug targeting. At present, it is not known how the prostate cancer metabolome contributes to health disparities. The information gleaned from this proposal could rapidly revolutionize current diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches by revealing the biological underpinnings of prostate cancer health

"Decision Aids to Address Prostate Cancer Disparities in Minority Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American and some Native American men experience a greater burden of prostate cancer in the United States. Surgery and radiation therapy are effective treatments, but each has different quality of life implications for men and their partners. These treatments, although potentially life-saving impose their own burden related to treatment side effects. Some men may benefit from a monitoring approach called ""active surveillance"" if they have early, slow-growing prostate cancer. Making the right treatment choice depends of men being given all appropriate options and making sure they have a high quality conversation with their specialty provider. Minority men in particular are not always given the evidence they need to make the right choice for them, and doctors and healthcare systems may not always pay attention to what is important to them. Tools called ""decision aids"" can improve knowledge and may reduce the burden associated with prostate cancer treatment in minority men. These tools inform men about their disease severity, treatment options, and the quality of life implications of each treatment option. They can be delivered in clinical discussion with specialists or prior to a visit with a specialist. However, decision aids are not routinely usd in specialty practice for prostate cancer. A tablet-based tool we have developed, Prostate Choice, helps men tailor their choice based on their disease risk, life expectancy, and current sexual and urinary function. It can be used in the clinical conversation. Another tool, Knowing Your Options, is a website with comprehensive educational materials that is designed for use prior to visits with specialists. We want to study two kinds of decision aids - ones delivered in te visit with a specialist and one delivered before seeing a specialist as well as the combination of the two decision aids-to see if we can put patients in the best position possible to make the treatment choice that is right for them. We think these tools will reduce known disparities in patient knowledge and may improve the burden of men's symptoms a year after prostate cancer diagnosis. We propose an experiment that delivers the two types of decision aids compared to usual care by assigning 32 specialty practices to get different types of decision aids or usual care. To test the experiment we will enroll 310 men (120 white, 120 African American, 70 American Indian/Alaska Native). From this experiment we will see whether one or the other of the two proposed decision aids or the combination of the two improves men's knowledge most compared to usual care. We will be able to determine whether those effects are the same or different for men from different racial backgrounds and education levels. By testing these tools we will determine whether they can reduce known disparities in patient knowledge and quality of life in minority men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among the more than 200,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, minority men face significant disparities in disease severity, knowledge about treatment options and implications, survival and symptom burden. Decision aids delivered within or prior to specialty visits or the combination might help reduce disparities by improving patient knowledge, and allowing them to make a treatment choice that is appropriate and that fits with their priorities related to sexual and urinary function. This proposal will test in-visit, out-of-vsit and combined in-visit/out-of-visit decision aids for African-American and American Indian/Alaska Native men for initial prostate cancer treatment decisions in a cancer cooperative group.",Decision Aids to Address Prostate Cancer Disparities in Minority Men,8884647,R01MD008934,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' literacy ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Regrets ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Mediating ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' tool ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' urinary ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' health information technology ', ' tablet device ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' ']",NIMHD,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,357881,0.1926486048293844
"Genomics and Predictive Modeling of Prostate Cancer Heath Disparity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) men have an increased incidence and earlier age of onset of prostate cancer and two-fold higher rate of mortality from disease than Caucasian American (CA) men that does not correlate with socioeconomic status. Recent work in the PI's laboratory has shed light on the organization of the genomes of metastatic prostate cancers and primary prostate cancers from CA and AA men and has demonstrated that innate tumor characteristics may contribute to the observed health disparities. Compared to normal, non-cancerous genomes, the tumor genomes contain copy number alteration (CNA) gains or losses of genes that mediate initiation and progression. When matched for age, Gleason score and stage, the genomes of primary AA prostate cancers have a greater number of CNAs that predispose to metastasis compared to the genomes of CA prostate cancers. This study will validate the initial prostate cancer metastatic potential/health disparity study through somatic genomic DNA copy number analysis. A risk metric will be developed for each CNA that will be incorporated into a model that estimates the likelihood that a tumor will metastasize. The genetic predictors will be combined with clinical risk predictors to develop and evaluate a comprehensive statistical risk assessment model. Areas under the receiver-operator curves will be assessed to measure and compare the discriminatory accuracy. Paired analyses will be performed to demonstrate the presence of similar CNA profiles in biopsy and corresponding radical prostatectomy tumor specimens. In addition, whole genome sequencing will be applied to AA and CA tumors of different characteristics - primaries of different metastatic potential and metastases. These will be analyzed for mutations, duplications, and deletions that may have had a causal role. This project is built on a study that identified innate genomic differences of AA and CA prostate cancers through a novel application of natural selection theory. The research of tumor biology will translate into a risk model for determining whether prostate cancers should be treated aggressively or with watchful waiting. The metastasis-promoting genes identified could become targets for new therapies.",Genomics and Predictive Modeling of Prostate Cancer Heath Disparity,8899457,U01CA158431,"['Age ', ' Biopsy ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Area ', ' Age of Onset ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Staging ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' cohort ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' novel ', ' Watchful Waiting ', ' Patient observation ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Genomics ', ' Prostate Carcinoma Metastatic ', ' Metastatic Prostate Cancer ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' cancer genome ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' DNA copy number ', ' tumor ', ' clinical risk ', ' gDNA ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' ']",NCI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",U01,2015,366903,0.33848716445160365
"Obesity and prostate cancer risk in Black and White men: a functional approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Both obesity (Body Mass Index (BMI)e30) and prostate cancer (PCa) constitute significant public health problems, for which there are persistent disparities between African American men (AAM) and Non-Hispanic European men (EAM). Obesity as a physiological state is characterized by significant alterations in the individual's hormonal profile. Since PCa is a hormonal disease, it appears biologically plausible that obesity affects PCa risk, possibly through the altered tumor growth enabled by the hormonal imbalances. This effect may be even more pronounced in AAM since their PCa tumors tend to demonstrate more aggressive biological behavior at baseline. Indeed, a few studies have linked obesity to more aggressive PCa in AAM specifically, suggesting involvement of obesity in PCa disparity. However, to date, the mechanistic biology studies aimed to elucidate the effects of obesity on PCa risk in AAM and EAM are lacking. In concordance with the published literature, our recent preliminary data suggest that obesity may be a PCa risk factor in AAM, and the extent of risk is determined by the individual's genetic variation. The goal of our project is to understand the joint impact of germline genetic variations and obesity on prostate tumor biology and PCa risk in AAM and EAM. We hypothesize that select genetic variation, when combined with the environment of obesity, influences PCa risk by impacting key cellular processes relevant to the tumor biology. To test this hypothesis, a functional integrated approach is proposed, that utilizes prostate tumor biology as a starting point. In the Aim 1, we will investigate whether there are differences in the gene expression profiles in prostate tumors and healthy prostate tissue of obese and non-obese men in each race. In the Aim 2, we will test the functional significance of the identified genes. Finally, in te Aim 3 we propose to link obtained data to PCa risk through variation in the germline genome. Significance. Understanding the specific role of obesity in PCa risk is crucial for efficient development of individualized PCa risk estimation in AAM and EAM; selection of the most appropriate treatment modalities; estimating the risk of progression; advancing knowledge of the tumor biology in AAM and EAM; and developing targeted risk reduction interventions. Innovation. Our work is innovative, comprehensive and contemporary in that we propose functionally relevant genetic variation to be incorporated in the risk prediction. Future direction. Guided by our findings, we plan to launch a clinical preventive study aimed to validate the results in a larger cohort of AAM and EAM, improve the proposed approach, and test the chemopreventive and/or lifestyle interventions targeted towards specific tumor and genetic features in AAM and EAM. In addition, our proposed model can be applied to study gene-environmental interactions in virtually any other malignancy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because its overarching goal is to reduce the prostate cancer burden on society, by understanding the role of obesity and germline genetic variation in prostate cancer risk in men of African and European descent. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NCI's mission of supporting research with respect to the prevention of cancer.",Obesity and prostate cancer risk in Black and White men: a functional

"Racial differences in CYP1B1 polymorphisms and risks for prostate cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the USA, African-American (AfA) men have higher incidence and death rates due to prostate cancer when compared to Caucasians (Cau). The reasons for this discrepancy are unknown but studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1), a gene that activates carcinogens, to be involved in prostate cancer pathogenesis. The goal of this project is to determine if CYP1B1 SNPs are risk factors for race-related prostate cancer and we hypothesize that these variants: 1) differ between AfA and Cau, 2) contribute to race-related prostate cancer and its progression, (3) are associated with prostate tissue levels, and (4) cause differences in enzyme levels and activity. Two specific aims are proposed to achieve the goals of the project. Aim #1 will investigate whether SNPs of CYP1B1 are risk factors for race- related prostate cancer. Blood DNA and prostate tissue will be collected from AfA and Cau patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and various stages and grades of prostate cancer; as well as blood DNA from age- matched, healthy male volunteers. The following experiments will be performed: (a) SNPs in the CYP1B1 promoter and coding region will be determined by sequence-specific PCR and direct genomic sequencing. The correlation of CYP1B1 SNPs and haplotypes with race and prostate cancer susceptibility and progression will be determined. (b) Localization of CYP1B1 in BPH and cancer tissues will be monitored by immunohistochemistry. By cross-referencing SNPs and haplotypes, the effects of polymorphisms on tissue CYP1B1 levels will be determined. In Aim #2, the mechanistic effects of CYP1B1 SNPs identified in Aim #1 will be investigated. The following experiments will be performed: (a) Construct CYP1B1 wildtype plasmids by cloning and generate polymorphic variants using site-directed mutagenesis, (b) Transfect promoter constructs into race-specific prostate cell lines and determine their effects on gene expression by luciferase reporter assay, (c) Transfect SNP constructs into E coli to express altered proteins and determine their enzymatic activity by utilizing a CYP1B1 assay. Successful completion of the proposed research will elucidate the (a) role of CYP1B1 polymorphisms as a risk factor and biomarker for race-related prostate cancer susceptibility and progression, and (b) effect of CYP1B1 variants on enzymatic levels and activities. Understanding the functional role of the CYP1B1 gene variants in race-specific prostate cancer will provide improved strategies for the management of this disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Prostate cancer rates in the USA are dramatically higher in African-Americans compared to Caucasians and the proposed research seeks to examine the role of cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) gene polymorphisms in racial health disparity. The proposed work investigates CYP1B1 variants as a biomarker for prostate cancer as well as novel mechanistic features of the variants at the cellular and genetic level using race-specific prostate cancer tissue and cells. This study will lead to a better understanding of the reasons for the disparity between the two groups for prostate cancer and thus, the goals of this proposal are highly relevant to public health.",Racial differences in CYP1B1 polymorphisms and risks for prostate cancer,9016507,R21CA185003,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' benign prostate hyperplasia ', ' Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ', ' Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' ortho-Dihydroxybenzenes ', ' o-Dihydroxybenzenes ', ' Pyrocatechols ', ' 2-hydroxyphenol ', ' 1,2-dihydroxybenzene ', ' 1,2-benzenediol ', ' Catechols ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cloning ', ' P450 ', ' Cytochrome P450 Family Gene ', ' Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System ', ' Cytochrome P-450 ', ' Cytochrome P450 ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' E coli ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Incidence ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Luciferases ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasmids ', ' Play ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Benign ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Death Rate ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' Staging ', ' Reporter ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Genomics ', "" Co(beta)-cyano-7''-(2-methyl)adeninylcobamide "", ' factor A ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Address ', ' Blood Screening ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' volunteer ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' prostate carcinogenesis ', ' prostate tumorigenesis ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R21,2016,166714,0.4001719186277269
"Diagnosing clinically-significant prostate cancer in African American men: Systematic random versus MR-image-fusion guided biopsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most localized prostate cancers (PCa) are indolent and will never become aggressive during a patient's lifetime. Many of these patients could benefit from active surveillance (AS), but uncertainty about their individual risk prompts them to choose radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy, which can negatively impact quality of life, with only ~10% of patients in the US electing AS. Among the key barriers that prevent a more widespread adoption of AS is the fact that the current 12-core systematic random prostate needle diagnostic biopsy (SR-Bx) protocol can miss areas of more advanced disease already present in the prostate in ~30% of patients, thus introducing under-staging and under-grading error at the time of diagnosis. This error seems to be higher among African-American (AA) men, who are at a disproportionally higher risk of developing aggressive PCa and of dying of their disease. Specifically, among AA men, existing predictors to determine AS eligibility seem to perform more poorly, the rate of high-grade tumors missed during biopsy is higher, and rates tumor progression while on AS are higher. Therefore, there is an urgent need to test more reliable biopsy approaches to better discriminate men with clinically insignificant disease (CiPCa), who will truly benefit from AS, from those with clinically significant PCa (CSPCa) who require definitive treatment. We have shown that among white men the use of MRI for identifying suspicious lesions and for targeting prostate biopsies to them with MRI-US image-fusion biopsy technique (MRUS-Bx) outperforms SR-Bx in CSPCa detection, cancer core length, cancer rate per core, cancer volume estimation, and detection of anterior cancers (more common among AA men). We now propose to undertake a randomized controlled trial to compare the detection rate of CSPCa between SR-Bx and MRUS-Bx among AA and white men, to provide better clinical tools to discriminate between CSPCa and CiSPCa and thus, in the long term, improve overall survival among AA men. AIM 1: We propose to enroll 400 men (200 AA, 200 white) with elevated PSA (>2.5 ng/mL) and negative digital rectal exam across 5 academic institutions and 1 private practice. Men will be randomized into two arms: 1) SR-Bx (12 cores) with an MRI 3-months after biopsy for men without CSPCa; 2) pre-biopsy MRI with MRUS- Bx (2 cores/lesion) for men MRI visible lesions (PIRADS > 3). We will compare biopsy detection rate of CSPCa and CiSPCa. AIM 2: we will validate among men who elect RP (~110 in the RCT) the accuracy of MRUS-Bx based on the agreement with findings from step-sectioned RP specimens. AIM 3: we will identify among men invited to participate and those enrolled in the RCT, determinants of a) study participation and b) treatment decision (AS vs radiation vs RP), and c) compare morbidity associated with either SR-Bx vs MRUS-Bx. The results of our study may change the standard of care and improve accuracy in the diagnosis of PCa among asymptomatic men, which will increase confidence in making the correct treatment decision (definitive treatment versus active surveillance), particularly AA men with PCa who are at the greatest disadvantage. 1         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will validate a novel protocol for the diagnosis of prostate cancer among asymptomatic men that has the potential to reduce over-diagnosis and increase the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. This approach promises to be especially relevant for African-American men who are at the highest risk of getting prostate cancer, have higher rates of under-diagnosis of aggressive disease, and thus limited eligibility for active surveillance. Therefore, the results of this study have the potentia to change the standard of practice for diagnosis of localized PCA, reduce overtreatment, and reduce disparities in cancer detection and management among African-Americans.        ",Diagnosing clinically-significant prostate cancer in African American men: Systematic random versus MR-image-fusion guided biopsy,9084326,R01CA205058,"['treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' rectal ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Lesion ', ' Indolent ', ' Individual ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' success ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Reporting ', ' Radiation ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Length ', ' Detection ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Clinical Management ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' prostate biopsy ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Adoption ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Goals ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Needles ', ' Patients ', ' Private Practice ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,595520,0.17208307638421996
"Modeling to Improve Prostate Cancer Outcomes Across Diverse Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. In the US, 1 in 7 men will experience a prostate cancer diagnosis in his lifetime. Identifying ways to reduce the burden of prostate cancer is therefore a top research priority. Management of prostate cancer has changed dramatically since the advent and widespread dissemination of the PSA test. Since the early 1990s, prostate cancer mortality in the US has dropped by almost half. The CISNET Prostate Working Group (PWG) was formed to use disease modeling to explain these mortality trends. The CISNET PWG has developed three models of prostate cancer natural history, detection, and survival and calibrated them against US prostate cancer trends. Results indicate that both screening and treatment changes have reduced prostate cancer deaths. However, policies must be tailored to limit harms and costs associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Different approaches for doing this have been proposed but cannot all be investigated in prospective studies. The objective of this application is to utilize and extend the CISNET PWG models to identify tailored and targeted intervention strategies that offer the most benefit while limiting harms and costs. We will determine whether we can improve screening further by using novel stratification approaches and also whether we can safely limit harms of overtreatment by judicious choices of primary and secondary therapies. These approaches will be applied in the US population and in international cancer control settings that may require modified strategies. We will provide decision makers with model access via online calculators with graphical user interfaces. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Identify active surveillance strategies that minimize patient burden without increasing risks of progression to non-curable disease or death. Aim 2: Develop stratified approaches to prostate cancer screening that target high-risk men based on polygenic risk and baseline PSA at age 45. Aim 3: Model secondary treatment strategies, their impact, and implications for population prostate cancer control. Aim 4: Determine whether racial disparities in prostate cancer mortality can be reduced by using stratified screening and treatment strategies. Aim 5: Modularize models to evaluate cancer control programs in non-US populations and collaborate with investigators in the UK and the Caribbean to develop policies for their populations and resources. Aim 6: Develop online calculators to support patient-physician decisions and policymaker deliberations about PSA screening and treatment for localized prostate cancer. These aims are highly responsive to the funding opportunity announcement, addressing 6 of the 9 targeted priority areas. Our cumulative expertise in prostate modeling, our existing models, and our close ties with clinical experts who provide access to large, high-quality datasets for model validation and calibration position us well to uniquely contribute to the national and international dialogue about how best to address and control this most common cancer in men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative The most effective ways to prevent, treat, and manage prostate cancer remain uncertain. Our team of investigators uses a unique inter-disciplinary approach for bringing together high-quality data from a wide range of sources and developing unified models of cancer progression to answer the most critical questions. In this application, we will examine efficiency gains of screening only high-risk individuals, benefits of avoiding or delaying treatment for low-risk cancers, and feasible approaches for reducing racial disparities.

"Genetic Signatures Underlying Prostate Cancer Metastasis in AfricanAmericans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common noncutaneous cancer diagnosed in men in the United States. It is now well established that the incidence and associated mortality and morbidity from PCa shows ethnicity specific disparity, African Americans being disproportionately affected. One major challenge related to management of PCa patients is the variable and often indolent nature of the disease progression. It is difficult to predict whether men diagnosed with PCa will develop aggressive cancer if left untreated or treated with an approach less aggressive than surgery. Most deaths and disabilities from PCa are attributable to the metastatic phase of the disease, for which currently there is no curative therapy. The molecular and cellular underpinnings of PCa metastasis remain poorly understood, multiple-hits acquired from somatic genetic alterations are considered to be important contributing factor. The central hypothesis of this project is that comparing normal, primary and metastatic cancerous prostate tissues from the same patient can identify somatic mutations driving metastasis of PCa. To test this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims for this study: (i) to perform whole exome sequencing of normal, primary tumor and metastatic prostate cancer tissue from 20 African American patients to identify somatic risk variants, mapping the mutated genes and identifying candidates for metastasis; and (ii) To perform in vitro functional characterization of two top-ranked genes identified from specific aim 1 using forced overexpression and knockdown approaches to evaluate their mechanistic impact in driving PCa metastasis. Results from this study will lead to the advancement in our current understanding on the genetic underpinnings of PCa metastasis. PCa metastasis specific biomarkers identified from the results of this study have the potential to be used clinically to screen for, diagnose or monitor the progression of PCa and to guide molecular targeted therapy or assess therapeutic response. Findings from this study may not only be usefully informative for African Americans, but can also provide more generalizable insights into this disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is designed to study the underlying genetic factors for prostate cancer metastasis in African Americans who are known to be disproportionately affected by the disease with poor outcomes. By whole exome sequencing of normal, primary and metastatic cancer tissue from same patient, we will identify genes/pathways driving prostate cancer metastasis. We will then examine the biological role of two top-tier genes in cancer metastasis.            ",Genetic Signatures Underlying Prostate Cancer Metastasis in AfricanAmericans,9092899,R21CA199171,"['cancer biomarkers ', ' cancer markers ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' curative treatments ', ' curative therapy ', ' curative therapeutic ', ' curative intervention ', ' molecular targeted therapies ', ' molecular targeted treatment ', ' molecular targeted therapeutics ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' Affect ', ' Arts ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"SCIENCE OF GLOBAL PROSTATE CANCER DISPARITIES PROJECT SUMMARY Prostate cancer (CaP) is the second most common cancer in men globally and the most common male cancer in Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America. While all Black men are disproportionately affected by CaP, African American and Jamaican men have been noted to have the highest rate of CaP in the world. To better understand and effectively address the disproportionate burden of CaP in Black men, it is important to explore CaP among Black men globally for the following reasons: [1] the ancestral link among Black men, especially those connected by the Transatlantic Slave Trade; and [2] the growing literature on the disproportionate burden of CaP among Black men of West African ancestry in the Caribbean, Europe, and West Africa. The Biennial Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men Conference continues to provide opportunity for CaP scientists, clinicians, advocates, and survivors all over the world to come together to address the global burden of CaP among Black men. The 4th biennial conference uniquely focuses on making progress in conquering prostate cancer in Black men by exploring personalized cancer care in the era of precision medicine. The agenda has been uniquely designed to foster effective interactions among all delegates, and to educate, and to facilitate immediate dissemination of the science to survivors and advocates. The conference will take place in Lake Nona Medical City, Orlando, Florida because of the significant burden of CaP in Florida. In addition, the location offers excellent facilities for meetings and tourism. The conference will be held November 9-12, 2016. The primary host for the conference is the University of Florida, with co-sponsorship by the Prostate Cancer Transatlantic Consortium (CaPTC), African-Caribbean Cancer Consortium (AC3) and Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate (MADCaP) Consortium. There is significant collaborative support through several other national and international organizations, including the: African Organization for Research and Training in Cancer (AORTIC), Central Florida Pharmacy Council (CFPC), and the Black Male Prostate Cancer Coalition.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The 4th Biennial conference on “The Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men” is proposed to bring prostate cancer scientists, clinicians, survivors, and advocates together to share cross cutting prostate cancer research issues focused on personalized cancer care and develop the next priorities for research, education and community outreach in the era of precision medicine.",SCIENCE OF GLOBAL PROSTATE CANCER DISPARITIES,9194583,R13CA210494,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Europe ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Literature ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methodology ', ' North America ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Slave ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' Consensus Development ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Guidelines ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' African ', ' Fostering ', ' Prostate CA Prevention ', ' prostate cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' infectious organism ', ' Infectious Agent ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' African Caribbean ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' carcinoma prostatic cancer ', ' Prostatic carcinoma ', ' Prostate carcinoma ', ' Participant ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' International ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Research Training ', ' Behavioral ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench to clinic ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' sharing data ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalized cancer care ', ' Jamaican ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R13,2016,25000,0.29963039347932824
"A Multilevel Intervention to Increase the Participation of African Americans in Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer clinical trials are essential to translating research into tangible benefits for patients, but only a small number of patients enroll in a trial Under-enrollment of minorities is an even greater problem because it limits the generalizability of findings and contributes to treatment disparities. Minority under-enrollment in prostate cancer trials is especially troublesome because of the higher incidence, morbidity, and mortality of this cancer among African American men, as compared to White men. The overall goal of our research is to improve cancer care and reduce racial/ethnic cancer disparities by increasing rates at which African American men with prostate cancer make an informed decision to participate in a trial, based on high-quality communication with their physician. In this application, we propose a theory-based multilevel intervention designed to influence African-American patients' attitudes about physicians and about trials; physicians' attitudes about patients and about trials; and patient-provider clinical interactions in which trials may be discussed. The intervention is designed to improve these outcomes: patient understanding of trials and decisions to participate; physician decisions to discuss and offer trials; patient-physician communication; and ultimately, participation rates among African Americans with prostate cancer. We base the intervention on our prior research showing that patient and physician attitudes and beliefs often result in trials not being discussed during clinic visits, or when trials are discussed, communication is ineffective. These factors are even greater in racially discordant visits, and likely contribute to low trial enrollment among African Americans. We will conduct the proposed research at two NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers that provide care in urban areas. African American and White men will be included to allow comparison of the effects of the intervention by patient race. The intervention has two phases. Phase 1 is a randomized trial in which intervention group patients receive a tool to improve their attitudes about trials and increase their active participation in clinic visits in which trials maybe discussed. Phase 2 is an interrupted time series quasi-experiment in which physicians receive an intervention to improve their attitudes about trials and their communication during discussions of trials with patients. Data will include patient and physician self-reports, video recordings of patient-physician clinic visits, and medical records. We propose three Specific Aims: 1) determine the independent and combined effects of each phase of the intervention on outcomes; 2) compare the effects of the intervention on outcomes for African American versus White men; and 3) examine the extent to which patient-physician communication mediates the relationship between the intervention and outcomes. This research is highly significant and innovative because it tests a new conceptual model focusing on patients, physicians, and clinical interactions, and uses social psychological and communication theory to improve clinical practice. Findings should provide evidence for a practical, exportable intervention to increase trial enrollment among African American men with prostate cancer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinical trials are necessary to make progress in preventing and treating prostate and other cancers. Clinical trials to benefit a large, diverse community, members of majority and minority populations must participate, but minorities are underrepresented.

"METABOLOMIC PROFILING AND BIOLOGIC BASIS OF RACIAL DISPARITY IN PROSTATE CANCER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of our research plan is to reduce the disproportionate effects of prostate cancer on African American men. A guiding principle of our methodology is biochemical differences exist between prostate cancers of African American and European American origin and that these differences can explain, in part, prostate cancer health disparity. In this application, we propose to use the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover these underlying differences. Metabolomics describes the science of quantifying the levels of metabolites (e.g., small molecules) that are the byproducts of cellular metabolism. That is to say, in this kind of analysis we are measuring the biochemical entities (or metabolites) that are produced by the functional machinery of the cell. With knowledge of the identity of specific metabolites we can infer the biological processes that produced them, thus gaining insight into a cell's metabolism. To date, a metabolomic analysis of prostate cancer health disparity has not been reported. In preliminary studies, we have profiled the metabolome of prostate cancers from African-American and European American men and have identified specific racially distinct metabololites as well as biological pathways associated with each. In this proposal, we will i) validate and refine the metabolomic profile of prostate cancers from African American and European American men, ii) evaluate the role of specific biochemical pathways in prostate cancers of African American and European American men and iii) develop urine based metabolic markers for high risk prostate cancer in African American and European American men. At the conclusion of this study, we will have developed a racially derived metabolomic model for prostate cancer as well as identified candidate pathways for future drug targeting. At present, it is not known how the prostate cancer metabolome contributes to health disparities. The information gleaned from this proposal could rapidly revolutionize current diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches by revealing the biological underpinnings of prostate cancer health disparity.",METABOLOMIC PROFILING AND BIOLOGIC BASIS OF RACIAL DISPARITY IN PROSTATE CANCER,9117469,U01CA167234,"['Affect ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Body Fluids ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methodology ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Names ', ' Cyclic Nucleotides ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' poly ADP ribose synthetase ', ' poly ADP polymerase ', ' Poly(ADPribose) Polymerase ', ' PARS ', ' PARP Polymerase ', ' Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' N-methyl-glycine ', ' N-Methylglycine ', ' Methylglycine ', ' Sarcosine ', ' Science ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Glean ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Benign ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' prognostic ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Inequality ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Therapeutic ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Genetic ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' Purines/Pyrimidines/Nucleotides/Nucleic Acids Metabolism ', ' Nucleotide Synthesis ', ' nucleotide metabolism ', ' novel ', ' sober ', ' sobriety ', ' Reporting ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Property ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' cellular metabaolism ', ' cell metabolism ', ' Cellular Metabolic Process ', ' urinary ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer statistics ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' transcriptomics ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' arm ', ' prostate cancer model ', ' prostate tumor model ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' improved outcome ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' ']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2016,324183,0.42266473425442486
"Financial well-being following prostate cancer diagnosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer research has consistently shown evidence of racial/ethnic disparities across the cancer  continuum from detection/screening and treatment-related outcomes to mortality; and socioeconomic status  (SES) has been suggested as a substantial factor in the racial differences; yet, the research results for SES  disparities i prostate cancer-related outcomes as well as SES as an explanatory factor in racial/ethnic  disparities in prostate cancer have been inconsistent. Some have suggested that this inconsistency may be due to imprecise (and inconsistent or incomplete) measurement of socioeconomic circumstances.   Thus, there have been calls in the cancer disparities literature for greater clarity on the pathways and mechanisms causing differential cancer outcomes across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the conceptualization AND operationalization of socioeconomic circumstances in this literature.  An expanded view of the socioeconomic context for prostate cancer patients might uncover socioeconomic factors influencing disparities in treatment-related outcomes over and above the traditional SES measures; and a construct to capture this expanded socioeconomic context is financial well-being (FWB).  The  specific aims of the research project are to:  1) Develop and refine a conceptual model of the multidimensional  construct FWB using structured interviews with prostate cancer patients and a focus group with clinical social  workers; 2) Develop and pilot test a measure of FWB; 3) Evaluate the psychometric properties of the measure  of FWB and investigate the association between components of FWB, socio-demographic characteristics, and  treatment selection and adherence and perceived quality of treatment; and 4) Investigate differences in  responses to FWB items across racial/ethnic groups and evaluate potential measurement bias across  racial/ethnic groups. The successful completion of the research project will result in a valid measurement and causal model of FWB that articulates how the dimensions of FWB are related to prostate cancer treatment-related outcomes.  The candidate, Dr. Reginald Tucker-Seeley, is a Research Associate in the Center for Community Based Research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The proposed five year NCI Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) will provide the necessary mentoring, training, and research experiences in cancer care/health services, psycho-oncology, and measures/scale development to implement the proposed research project.  His long term career goal is to become an independent investigator developing projects to reduce socioeconomic disparities across the cancer continuum from prevention to end-of-life care.   Through this work, he plans to identify the socioeconomic pathways contributing to cancer disparities and to design innovate interventions that help individuals better manage and leverage their socioeconomic and psychosocial resources for improved health. A more comprehensive view of socioeconomic status (SES) may help us better understand how SES is actually experienced and how it affects prostate cancer treatment and outcomes.  Our limited knowledge about both the subjective and objective mechanisms through which socioeconomic experience impacts cancer treatment constrains our understanding of the factors that contribute to cancer disparities.  Expanding our conceptualization of SES to include material and psychosocial aspects of individual socioeconomic circumstances may help us begin to unpack the complex association between socioeconomic circumstances and the various types of prostate cancer treatment selected and adherence to treatment.",Financial well-being following prostate cancer diagnosis,9122332,K01CA169041,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Economics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' mortality ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Social Workers ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' psychosocial ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Adherence ', ' DF/HCC ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' Detection ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' treatment adherence ', ' screening ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K01,2016,46871,0.3160355794354311
"Basic Cancer Research in Cancer Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common lethal tumor among US males yet little is known about its causative mechanisms. This study proposes to examine how glycosylation of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) affects steroid hormone signaling in prostate cancer. We will define the impact of SHBG glycosylation, including the D327N SHBG polymorphism, on steroid hormone associated prostate cancer risk and disparity in African and Caucasian Americans. Protein glycosylation is critical for interaction of prostate cells with its environment. We will evaluate how glycosylation of SHBG affect the distribution of the protein between plasma and tissue and how this affects disease development. The quantification of the SHBG glycoforms will be achieved by novel LC-MS assays. In addition, we will comprehensively summarize the impact of polymorphisms on N-glycosylation in the human proteome. Our hypothesis is that prostate cancer risk and progression are related to the variability in the glycosylation of SHBG. Our objective is to perform quantitative mass spectrometric assays of SHBG glycosylation in conjunction with measurement of steroid hormones. We will select men for phenotypic characterization by genotyping of a case control population with 50% African American representation. In addition, we will genotype a case series for which both serum and tissue are available. Steroid hormones will be measured by GC-MS. We will analyze the SHBG glycoforms and steroid hormones at the tissue level and in the circulation. The study is expected to fill important gaps in our understanding of prostate cancer etiology and progression. The analysis of SHBG glycoforms will provide new information on the biological factors underlying prostate carcinogenesis. The results are expected to improve prostate cancer prevention, detection and intervention strategies. This research is important because a comparative analysis of SHBG glycosylation and steroid hormones in prostate cancer, especially in African American men, has not been previously undertaken. We are proposing the first large scale examination of SHBG site occupancy in prostate cancer and health disparity of the disease.

"Signaling Pathway Alterations in the Racial Disparity of Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men have the highest rates of prostate cancer and the death rates due to prostate cancer are two times higher than Caucasians. The reason for the disparity is still unclear, but recent scientific studies suggest that the genetic and molecular changes in different ethnics are responsible for the disparity in African American men. These changes are responsible for different clinical outcome of prostate cancer in African American. Recent preliminary study showed that differences at molecular levels in prostate tissues between African American and Caucasian do exist. Therefore, we would like to further identify the molecules associated with prostate cancer racial disparity at the protein level using our novel Proteomic Pathway Array method, and to understand the mechanism of these molecules as a cause of the health disparity for prostate cancer among African American men. The success of the proposed study will have a profound benefit on the health of men, especially African Americans. The search for molecules that can distinguish those patients who will develop aggressive prostate cancer from those who will have a less aggressive course can help to identify patients who need more close surveillance and treatment. Furthermore, the identification and functional studies of molecules responsible for the aggressive behavior of prostate cancer in African American will help to design anti-cancer drugs and strategies. The translation from the discovery from this study to clinical application (diagnosis and treatment) can be achieved at a short period of time after completion of this study. The potential contributions ofthe study to advance health disparity research will be 1) identify biomarkers for prostate cancer racial disparity, 2) provide molecular bases why there is a racial difference in prostate cancer, 3) open a brand new way to look into the causes of racial difference in prostate cancer.          This study will lead to discovery of novel signal transduction proteins involved in racial disparity of prostate cancer and will generate clinically relevant information for developing biomarkers for early detection of aggressive prostate  cancer in the African American community. The functional study of these signal transduction proteins in the context  of racial disparity may lead to development of novel treatment strategy for prostate cancer according to ethnic  background.

"Provider Characteristics and Quality of Prostate Cancer Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Assessment of comparative effectiveness of treatment is essential to achieve optimal quality of care [1-2]. Quality of care in healthcare is a multifaceted issue that involves factors related to patient, provider, health care system, community and environment [1-16]. Disparities exist in the quality of prostate cancer care across geographic regions, hospitals, age and racial and ethnic groups [17-23], including treatment variability among comparable patients [17-19, 24-27]. The objective of our study is to analyze the complex interplay of personal factors, clinical factors, provider factors and their relationship with variation in quality of care and heterogeneity of treatment among men with prostate cancer (localized or advanced). Specific aims are: (1): To assess the contribution of provider (hospital and physician) characteristics in the observed disparities (race/ethnicity and disability status) in process of care (type of treatment, time to treatment and diagnostic procedures), and outcomes (short-term and long-term), among prostate cancer patients; (2) To assess the contribution of patient and provider characteristics in the heterogeneous treatment effects among prostate cancer patients; (3) To assess the contribution of continuity of care to the disparity in quality of care (process of care and outcomes) and the heterogeneous treatment effects among prostate cancer patients. To accomplish these aims, we propose a retrospective cohort control design study using the SEER-Medicare linked data. All African American, Asian, Hispanic, and Caucasian men, diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1995 and 2012 (n=282,487) will be identified and followed retrospectively for one year pre-diagnosis and up to fifteen years post-diagnosis. Physician and hospital characteristics will be determined by linkage to the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Hospital Association (AHA) annual survey, respectively. Our main comparators are various treatments for localized or advanced prostate cancer. We will use multilevel modeling approach. First, we will study the association of hospital characteristics with racial and ethnic disparity in process of care and outcomes. Next, we will analyze the contribution made by physician characteristics to racial and ethnic disparity in process of care and outcomes. Finally, we will investigate the role played by continuity of care in the observed racial and ethnic disparity in process of care and outcomes. We will use propensity score and instrumental variable approaches to minimize measured and unmeasured biases. Our study proposes a novel systems approach for analyzing the complex interplay of provider characteristics and their relationship with racial and ethnic disparities in process of care and outcomes among prostate cancer patients. The study results will aid in development of micro and macro level treatment, care and payment policies to address disparity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Assessment of comparative effectiveness of treatment is essential to achieve optimal quality of care. Quality of care in healthcare is a multifaceted issue that involves factors related to patient, provider, health care system, community and environment.

"CANCER RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. African- American men are disproportionately impacted by prostate cancer and exhibit the highest incidence and mortality rate in the world. The underlying reasons for significant prostate cancer health disparities in African- American men are not clearly understood and may include both biological and socio-economic factors. The RCMl program has helped Clark Atlanta University (CAU) to establish the Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD), a premier research program in prostate cancer. CCRTD focuses on understanding prostate cancer health disparities and has successfully trained the next generation of minority scientists in the area of prostate cancer and developed a community-based educational and research program focusing on the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. In this RCMl renewal application, we propose to enhance, improve and manage our research programs to increase efficient use of technologies, increase research capacity and competitiveness and expand our network through collaborations and partnerships with researchers, research institutes and community organizations. We propose the following specific aims to achieve our goals: 1) To recruit and support additional scientists to build a competitive basic and translational research center focused on prostate cancer health disparities and 2) To maintain and expand the existing research infrastructure within CCRTD. To achieve the specific aims, we plan to focus on two primary activities: a) Administrative Core Activity and b) Technologies and Resources for Core Laboratories Activity. Under the Administrative Core Activity, our key focus areas will be i) Collaborations and Partnerships; ii) Professional Development Activities; iii) Evaluation Plan; iv) Recruitment and Hiring of Additional Faculty Investigators/Research Staff; and v) Pilot Project Program. RCMl funding is vital for the continued development of biomedical research infrastructure at CAU in general and to assist CCRTD in expanding its focus on prostate cancer, a disease that disproportionately impacts African Americans.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer affects the African-American community disproportionately.

"Decision Aids to Address Prostate Cancer Disparities in Minority Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American and some Native American men experience a greater burden of prostate cancer in the United States. Surgery and radiation therapy are effective treatments, but each has different quality of life implications for men and their partners. These treatments, although potentially life-saving impose their own burden related to treatment side effects. Some men may benefit from a monitoring approach called ""active surveillance"" if they have early, slow-growing prostate cancer. Making the right treatment choice depends of men being given all appropriate options and making sure they have a high quality conversation with their specialty provider. Minority men in particular are not always given the evidence they need to make the right choice for them, and doctors and healthcare systems may not always pay attention to what is important to them. Tools called ""decision aids"" can improve knowledge and may reduce the burden associated with prostate cancer treatment in minority men. These tools inform men about their disease severity, treatment options, and the quality of life implications of each treatment option. They can be delivered in clinical discussion with specialists or prior to a visit with a specialist. However, decision aids are not routinely usd in specialty practice for prostate cancer. A tablet-based tool we have developed, Prostate Choice, helps men tailor their choice based on their disease risk, life expectancy, and current sexual and urinary function. It can be used in the clinical conversation. Another tool, Knowing Your Options, is a website with comprehensive educational materials that is designed for use prior to visits with specialists. We want to study two kinds of decision aids - ones delivered in te visit with a specialist and one delivered before seeing a specialist as well as the combination of the two decision aids-to see if we can put patients in the best position possible to make the treatment choice that is right for them. We think these tools will reduce known disparities in patient knowledge and may improve the burden of men's symptoms a year after prostate cancer diagnosis. We propose an experiment that delivers the two types of decision aids compared to usual care by assigning 32 specialty practices to get different types of decision aids or usual care. To test the experiment we will enroll 310 men (120 white, 120 African American, 70 American Indian/Alaska Native). From this experiment we will see whether one or the other of the two proposed decision aids or the combination of the two improves men's knowledge most compared to usual care. We will be able to determine whether those effects are the same or different for men from different racial backgrounds and education levels. By testing these tools we will determine whether they can reduce known disparities in patient knowledge and quality of life in minority men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among the more than 200,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, minority men face significant disparities in disease severity, knowledge about treatment options and implications, survival and symptom burden. Decision aids delivered within or prior to specialty visits or the combination might help reduce disparities by improving patient knowledge, and allowing them to make a treatment choice that is appropriate and that fits with their priorities related to sexual and urinary function. This proposal will test in-visit, out-of-vsit and combined in-visit/out-of-visit decision aids for African-American and American Indian/Alaska Native men for initial prostate cancer treatment decisions in a cancer cooperative group.",Decision Aids to Address Prostate Cancer Disparities in Minority Men,9043187,R01MD008934,"['Affect ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' literacy ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mortality ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' United States ', ' Regrets ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Mediating ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' tool ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaska Native ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' urinary ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' health information technology ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' tablet device ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' treatment choice ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,359003,0.1926486048293844
"Comprhensive Center of Excellence in Health Disparities This Center of Excellence (COE) is being submitted to address significant gaps in our knowledge about disparities prostate cancer (PCa) outcomes, and to develop interventions that can be applied to reduce these disparities between African (AA) and European (EA) Americans in Philadelphia. The mission of the proposed center is to (1) undertake research that will identify biological, behavioral, social, environmental, geospatial, physical environmental, and health care factors that influence PCa outcomes, and (2) integrate, evaluate, and disseminate this information to at-risk populations in Philadelphia communities. These factors include both individual and area-level contextual (e.g., neighborhood) variables. We anticipate that the principles of this approach will ultimately be implementable in other communities to reduce PCa disparities.   This COE builds on our existing multidisciplinary research to specifically understand role of biomarkers, patterns of care, geospatial environment, and obesity after the diagnosis of PCa. This research requires transdisciplinary collaboration across multiple disciplines represented by the investigators participating in this COE. The proposed COE intends to catalyze needed improvements in the identification of men at greatest risk of unfavorable PCa outcomes to improve access to appropriate PCa treatment with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To conduct three highly interrelated transdisciplinary, translational research projects aimed at addressing prostate cancer disparities: a) Project 1: Evaluate the role of obesity in determining unfavorable prostate cancer outcomes (C. Zeigler-Johnson, PI); Project 2: Develop predictive models for understanding biomarkers, area-level contextual factors, and individual risk factors in predicting prostate cancer outcomes (T. Rebbeck, PI); Project 3: Determine whether variation in experienced and potential health care access and quality contributes to racial differences in treatment among men with localized prostate cancer (K. Armstrong, PI). Aim 2. To create specialized shared resource cores to serve the needs of these projects and the Center, including an Administrative Core (T. Rebbeck, Director); a research core (J. Holmes and C. Branas, co-Directors); and a community core (K. Glanz, Director). Aim 3: To develop transdisciplinary training at a variety of levels to train the next generation of health disparities researchers. Through this research, community outreach, and training, we will develop a program that can identify those groups at greatest risk for an unfavorable prostate cancer outcome, and develop approaches that can be used to minimize poor outcomes and the resulting disparities that unduly burden AA men. The proposed center of excellence will integrate the knowledge obtained in our previous research  experience to develop, evaluate, and begin to implement interventions aimed at reducing prostate cancer  disparities that affect African American men in Philadelphia.",Comprhensive Center of Excellence in Health Disparities,9013495,P60MD006900,"['Affect ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mission ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Development Plans ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' American ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Improve Access ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' data modeling ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' evidence base ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' model building ', ' summer program ', ' summer session ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P60,2016,1317183,0.25557141544477413
"Multidiciplinary Integrative Genomic Approach to Distinguish Lethal from Indolent Prostate Cancer in Men of Europena and African Ancestry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are several critical unmet needs in the management of localized prostate cancer. Central among them is the development of minimally invasive tools to distinguish localized cancers that are truly indolent from cancers that are progressive and potentially lethal. To address this key need, we first propose to perform an integrated, multi-dimensional genomic, epigenomic and expression analysis to uncover novel molecular pathways that characterize indolent vs. aggressive prostate cancers. In this approach we define indolent tumors as those screen detected (e.g. PSA screening) lesions that are Gleason score 6 (or less) that are organ confined at radical prostatectomy. We consider these tumors indolent as they do not appear capable of metastasis. In contrast, we equate Gleason score 8-10 tumors as ""interval"" or symptomatic since, even with primary treatment, these tumors often recur and metastasize at high frequencies. Additionally, we will validate our key markers/pathways discovered in this project using additional populations with long term outcomes. We hypothesize that our multi-modality genomic-based integrated approach, contrasting these two divergent tumor types, will reveal signatures that distinguish cancers with dichotomous phenotypes. We also hypothesize that these signatures will vary based on race and thus in parallel we will comprehensively characterize African American prostate cancers to reveal molecular features driving racial disparities in outcomes. We will validate the signatures obtained using large cohorts of cases with established outcomes including: (1) the Johns Hopkins Active surveillance cohort and (2) Prostate cancer cases from the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), an observational cohort of men followed since 1954 with autopsy documented indolent or aggressive/lethal disease. We also propose that these signatures will be able to predict outcomes of cancers with indeterminate kinetics and propose to test this through analysis of cases of intermediate risk prostate cancer with long-term follow-up and known outcomes from Johns Hopkins and in collaboration with colleagues from Harvard, from the Physician's Health and Health Professionals follow-up studies. Together this work will yield highly relevant information that can be directly applied to the clinical management of localized prostate cancer. Specifically, it will yield an integrated signature that distinguishes localized - indolent tumors from localized tumors with lethal potential. Additionally we believe these signatures will be critical in determining treatment strategies for individuals with prostate cancers of indeterminate kinetics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The key unmet need in the management of prostate cancers pivots around the dilemma of the screen detected tumor as clinicians balance over treating cancers that are indolent with delaying/under-treating cancers that are aggressive and pose harm. Nomograms containing clinical and pathologic variables are helpful but additional minimally invasive methods are needed to improve their predictive capabilities. This project, which will comprehensively characterization prostate cancers and their microenvironment from both Caucasian and African American men, will inform unique pathways that modulate these two states and allow the development of novel minimally invasive tools that improve patient care.",Multidiciplinary Integrative Genomic Approach to Distinguish Lethal from Indolent Prostate Cancer in Men

"Genome-wide sequencing of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men have two times or more the incidence rate of prostate cancer than other U.S. populations, and high rates of prostate cancer are also seen in other African and African-derived populations. It is generally accepted that both common and rare genetic variants contribute to risk of complex diseases such as prostate cancer, however their relative contributions to overall heritability is a subject of intense controversy. For rare variants to have a significant influence on the risk of complex disease the spectrum of effect sizes must be considerably larger in magnitude than for common variants; to date however there is only limited evidence for or against this hypothesis since the means of comprehensively testing rare variation in the genome has not been possible until very recently. In this proposal we seek to test the contributions of both common and rare genetic variants to the risk of prostate cancer in men of American ancestry using a targeted genome-wide association study approach. In Aim 1 we plan to sequence (at 30x coverage) the exome and regulatory regions (~160 Mb) of the genome, as defined by epigenetic marks in prostate cancer cell lines, in 1,000 men of African ancestry (500 with aggressive disease) and 1,000 controls. Both single SNP and burden of rare variants analyses will be performed and replication testing of the most statistically significant sequence variations (~24,000) will be examined in additional samples of African ancestry (6,000 cases and 6,000 controls) through the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer (AAPC) consortium. In addition to association testing of single variants, we will conduct ""burden of rare variants analyses"" of coding and non-coding variants at the gene and pathway level. In Aim 2, we will examine interactions between associated variants, environmental factors (thereby better defining the role of these factors) and disease severity. In Aim 3, we will assess biological function of the novel risk alleles identified in Aim 1 using a staged approach of eQTL analysis followed by in vitro analyses of enhancer activity as well as allele-specific effects. This proposal spans the spectrum of genetic epidemiologic research in prostate cancer, from genetic discovery (for all prostate cancer as well as aggressive disease) to gene environment interaction testing, to biological understanding. We expect this work to significantly advance knowledge of the etiology of prostate cancer and racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer risk, and to guide the development of future preventive, early detection, prognostic and even therapeutic measures. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, we will conduct targeted genome-wide sequencing in men of African ancestry to reveal genetic markers that may contribute to their greater risk of prostate cancer. We expect findings from this study will make a major contribution to our understanding of genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer and the genetic basis underlying familial aggregation and heritability of this common cancer. Identifying more genetic predictors of risk will have widespread applicability and significance, leading to better risk models to more accurately predict a man's risk of developing prostate cancer, and better intensive screening and preventive strategies that target men at high risk.",Genome-wide sequencing of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry,9114093,R01CA165862,"['Accounting ', '

"The Generation of Clinically Annotated and Molecularly Characterized PDX Animal Models from Racially and Ethnically Diverse Prostate Cancer Tissue ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AGEs and Race Specific Tumor Immune Response in Prostate Cancer African American (AA) prostate cancer patients are more likely to die of their disease than any other race or ethnic group in the US. Here in South Carolina (SC), age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates are 78% higher among AA men than EA men and mortality rates three times higher. While quality of care issues and socioeconomic status clearly contribute to cancer health disparities it is becoming increasing clear that molecular and genetic differences in tumor biology also play a critical role. Glycation is the non-enzymatic glycosylatio of sugars with proteins, lipids and DNA that lead to the production of reactive metabolites called advanced glycation end products (AGE's). AGEs accumulate in our tissues as we age to promote diseases associated with growing older such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Glycation occurs during normal metabolism but factors associated with cancer disparity such as poor diet and a lack of exercise significantly increase the accumulation of AGEs in our bodies. This study will conduct mechanistic research to investigate AGE accumulation as a biological consequence of the factors known to contribute to prostate cancer disparity. Our recent studies have led to our hypothesis that: ""Race specific elevations in AGEs alter tumor associated immune responses in prostate cancer"". AGEs function as a ligand activator for RAGE which is expressed on the surface of most immune cells. RAGE stimulation by AGE induces the transcriptional activation of a number of factors critical for the generation of an inflammatory environment including NFkB, STAT3 and HIF1a (4-6). Such activation results in the expression of immune associated cytokines such as IL1, IL6 and TNFa which are critical for mediating crosstalk between cancer cells and the stroma. Aim 1 will use primary and immortalized race specific cell line models to define the mechanistic implications of AGEs to the immune response. Aim 2 will use mouse models fed high and low AGE diets to determine the contribution of dietary AGEs to immune response and prostate cancer growth in vivo. The concept suggesting that AGE metabolites may represent a biological consequence of cancer disparity is a novel approach to explaining the increased incidence and mortality figures observed within specific populations. Associating the mechanistic links between glycation and altered immune response has also not been examined especially within the context of a race specific background or the prostate tumor microenvironment. By identifying a molecular consequence of cancer health disparity this study may contribute to reducing the cancer incidence and mortality rates among minority populations and identify novel potential biomarkers and define a novel area of therapeutic potential. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Factors such poor/unhealthy diet and a lack of exercise are more prevalent in African American men, increase AGE accumulation in our bodies and alter immune responses. Due to the higher complications and deaths associated with prostate cancer in African American men, a greater understanding of the mechanistic contribution of AGEs to tumor associated immune response and cancer disparity may contribute to reducing cancer incidence and mortality rates among minority populations, identify novel potential biomarkers and define a novel area of therapeutic potential.

"Genetics of Prostate Cancer in Africa ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most common cancer in men of African descent worldwide. African Americans (AA) suffer from the highest rates of CaP in the world, with an average annual incidence rate of 229 per 100,000 in the period 2006-2010 (SEER). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) GLOBOCAN program estimates that CaP is also the leading cancer in terms of incidence and mortality in men from Africa and the Caribbean. AA men experience the highest rate of aggressive CaP and CaP-specific mortality of any ethnic group in the US. IARC also predicts that CaP deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will almost double from 55,522 in 2010 to 105,758 by 2030 (i.e., more than twice as many deaths as in the US). While men of African descent around the world suffer disproportionately from CaP compared to men of other races or ethnicities, our understanding of the reasons for these disparities remains incomplete. To date, few exposure, lifestyle, or environmental influences have been identified in CaP etiology. In contrast, CaP is among the most heritable of common cancers, and over 90 susceptibility loci have been identified. However, many of these loci have not been replicated in AA, in part because of limited African descent sample sizes, incomplete capture of African alleles, and a limited understanding of African genomic architecture.  To better understand the etiology of CaP in African descent men, we have initiated a large, multicenter consortium known as ""Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate"" (MADCaP). Using resources of this consortium, we propose to undertake a multicenter study of CaP in SSA addressing the following Aims:  Specific Aim 1: Genetic Susceptibility: Discover novel CaP loci and validate known CaP loci in African men to provide new information about the genetic etiology of CaP.  Specific Aim 2. Population Genomics: Evaluate how population differentiation and the recent evolutionary history of African and African American populations inform the underlying reasons for the high rates of CaP in African Americans.  This proposal will identify African alleles influence CaP risk in African populations, and will provide information about the African genome that will be of value to a wide range of genome discovery studies in CaP and other diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer is a significant and under-appreciated public health problem in Africa and represents a critical public health concern in African Americans. We propose to address these concerns by developing a multicenter collaborative structure for prostate cancer research in Africa. Using this infrastructure, we will detect novel African alleles using a genome-wide association approach, evaluate African ancestral genomic relationships and thereby gain knowledge about prostate cancer etiology relevant to men in African and across the African diaspora, including African Americans.",Genetics of Prostate Cancer in Africa,9139465,U01CA184374,"['Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genome ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mortality ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Link ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Genetic ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Staging ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' carcinoma prostatic cancer ', ' Prostatic carcinoma ', ' Prostate carcinoma ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' IARC ', ' International Agency for Research on Cancer ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' infrastructure development ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,U01,2016,1916441,0.26346707882784454
"Novel gene that determines metastatic phenotype in African-American men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate cancer (CaP) exhibits the most striking racial disparity, as African American men are at 1.4 times higher risk of being diagnosed and 2-3 times higher risk of dying of CaP, compared to Caucasian men. African- American men with metastatic-CaP exhibit a high rate of mortality. The impediment in identifying an effective treatment to treat this lethal condition is due to the paucity in the knowledge about the mechanism of metastatic cell growth and motility. We have identified a novel mechanism that controls growth and motility of metastatic-type tumor cells in African-American men. We provide evidence that ROBO1 (roundabout gene 1) acts as a tumor suppressor gene and important check-point that decides the fate of tumor cell-phenotype. During organogenesis, the ROBO1 is reported to regulate cell proliferation, migration and adhesion in tissues including reproductive system. Using prostatic tissues from African-American CaP patients, and cell-based model representative of CaP disease in African-American men, we show that ROBO1 is lost during metastatic condition in African-American men. We show that the difference in ROBO1 expression levels between primary and metastatic stage in African-Americans is significantly distinguishable, (while as Caucasians patients exhibit none of such distinctions between tumor stages). Furthermore, we provide evidence that ROBO1 gene- promoter is hypermethylated in African-American metastatic-CaP cells, whereas Caucasian metastatic-CaP cells do not exhibit hypermethylation of this gene. These data clearly establishes ROBO1 as a factor that distinguishes African-American CaP from Caucasian-CaP, and suggests a possible role of this gene in health disparity in African-Americans. Our proof-of principle studies showed that reactivation of ROBO1 inhibits the migration of metastatic tumor cells thus suggesting the therapeutic potential of ROBO1-pathway in CaP. Based on these data, we generated a global hypothesis that ROBO1 could act as a potential biomarker that would discriminate between primary and metastatic disease in African-American men. We suggest that ROBO1 warrants further investigation using relevant-race distinct in vitro and in vivo models. We propose three specific aims: (Aim# 1): To study the mechanism-based role of ROBO1 during the progressive stages of CaP development using a carcinogenesis cell-based model in African-American men. (Aim #2): To investigate the significance of ROBO1 as a therapeutic target for metastatic tumor growth using subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models of African-American CaP. (Aim#3): Test the relevance of tissue-ROBO1 as a biomarker for (A) disease phenotype-distinction and (B) CaP-aggressiveness in African-Americans. We believe that the successful outcome of this proposal will be extremely valuable in providing a clinically relevant phenotype- distinguishing biomarker. ROBO1 as a biomarker would help clinicians to decide if a patient should go for therapy and will be useful for African-American patients. We suggest that ROBO1 is a druggable target for treating metastatic-CaP disease in African-American men.

"Modulation of host intrinsic immunity to reduce prostate cancer disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer health disparities represent a major public health concern in the United States. Even when socioeconomic factors are accounted for, minority populations have higher overall incidence rates and worse outcomes than the overall population. Prostate cancer is one such disease with higher incidence and death rates in African American (AA) men than Caucasians. Although socioeconomic factors may be blamed to a certain extent, it is appreciated that the genetic composition makes AA men more susceptible to aggressive prostate cancer. Genetic and epigenetic changes are known as tumorigenic drivers because epigenetic editing precludes mounting of host antitumor response necessary for tumor cell clearance. DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), is the best-characterized epigenetic modification in prostate cancer, and racial disparities in DNA methylation are associated with cancer prognosis and survival. Therefore, targeting of DNMT to reverse epigenetic alterations is an appealing therapeutic target, and vital to reduce the observed prostate cancer outcome gaps among AA men and Caucasians. The deoxycytidine analogue decitabine is unique in that it can be repositioned for non-cytotoxic depletion of DNMT. We characterized a low dose of decitabine with its increased absorption in the presence of tetrahydrouridine (THU). Combination of THU with decitabine changes its pharmacology, and facilitates non-cytotoxic DNMT1 depletion. We demonstrated that the THU-decitabine combination significantly inhibits the growth of TRAMP-C2 prostate tumors in immune competent mice, and the addition of CpG immunotherapy further enhanced antitumor immunity. Based on our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that THU-decitabine directed epigenetic therapy revitalize the host intrinsic immunity and augment vaccine-induced antitumor response. Since DNA methylation is prevalent and relates to greater risk in AAs, DNMT depletion will invigorate the immune response of tumor-bearing host, providing an opportunity to immunotherapy inducing robust antitumor immunity. We will test the combination of THU-decitabine directed DNMT depletion, immune modulation and therapeutic vaccine to determine 1) the effect of epigenetic editing on prostate cancer cell growth in murine models; and 2) the effector mechanism of THU-decitabine guided vaccine- induced antigen-specific antitumor immunity in complete regression of early and advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. This project is novel because the concept of a non-toxic THU-decitabine combination with immunotherapy has not been tested in any cancer type. This combinatorial approach will significantly attenuate the growth of aggressive prostate cancer as often presented in AA men, and may represent a novel treatment to reduce prostate cancer disparity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer is the second highest cause of cancer related deaths for men in the United States. However, the unfortunate fact is that the African American men are disproportionally affected by prostate cancer with considerably high incidence and as much as twice the mortality rate than Caucasians. Determining the significance of the host immunity reconstitution following combination approaches of epigenetics editing and immunotherapy in race based prostate cancer is the major goal of this study. If our efficacy aims are achieved, the excellent safety profile of our non-cytotoxic regimen conducive to translate to humans is very promising aimed to reduce prostate cancer disparity.

"Genetic factors for race related prostate cancer. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major problem or barrier is that there are currently no methods or approaches to adequately address prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans. A major question is why do African American men have a higher overall incidence, earlier age of onset, increased proportion of clinically advanced disease and increased bone metastases and mortality from prostate cancer compared to Caucasians? The main goal of this project is to investigate the genetic basis of prostate cancer health disparities The rationale is that prostate cancer is the leading cancer among men of African descent in the USA. Despite more aggressive screening of prostate cancer across all demographics in the United States, disparities among populations persist. A substantial proportion of African American men have a higher overall incidence, earlier age of onset, increased proportion of clinically advanced disease and increased bone metastases and mortality from prostate cancer compared to Caucasians. There are racial disparities in survival after diagnosis of prostate cancer in men. Therefore, prostate cancer incidence and mortality represent a significant public health problem in African American men. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs are significantly altered in prostate cancer. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the differential expression profile of a set of oncogenic miRNAs and tumor suppressor miRNAs in African Americans may target a set of prostate cancer specific genes and may contribute to the prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans. The molecular mechanisms of action of tumor suppressor miRNAs are through repressing oncogenes and activating tumor suppressor genes. We will test these hypotheses through analyses of a series of experiments proposed under our specific aims. All the aims are highly focused, centralized, innovative, clinically significant, functional and mechanistic in nature. Specific Aim # 1. Investigate the role of miRNAs as the genetic basis of prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. Specific Aim # 2. Investigate the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of action of oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs in race-related prostate cancer. Specific Aim # 3. Investigate the molecular mechanisms of differential expression of miRNAs in African Americans and Caucasians. Impact: The present application has high impact because it describes a novel concept and approach that is different and better from the previous attempts since differential expression of a set of miRNAs may explain why African Americans have higher incidence of prostate cancer compared to Caucasians. This project will identify novel miRNAs that can be used as genetic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for race-related prostate cancer.

"Circadian Disruption and Risk of Prostate Cancer in a Multiethnic Cohort ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 1.1 million men are diagnosed with prostate cancer globally and causing 300,000 cancer-specific deaths each year. The impact is particularly profound for African-American men who suffer significantly increased mortality rates. The sources of these substantial prostate cancer disparities are unclear. Our application focuses on disruption of circadian rhythms and prostate cancer risk in a racially/ethnically diverse cohort. The rationale is based on the classification of nightshift work as a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a proposed mechanism through circadian disruption. Our preliminary data from cohorts of white men show that several key components of circadian disruption, including low melatonin, increased sleep disruption, and variation in circadian genes, all are linked with with higher risk of advanced prostate cancer. African-American men have altered circadian rhythms and low melatonin compared to men of other races. We propose an integrative molecular epidemiology study of circadian disruption to investigate the association between circadian disruption and prostate cancer risk, and the extent to which circadian disruption explains racial disparities.  The study will be nested among men in the prospective Multiethnic Cohort (MEC), ongoing since 1993 and including Latino, African-American, Hawaiian, Japanese and white men. We will measure pre-diagnostic urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, the primary metabolite of melatonin, among 1,648 prostate cancer cases (N=801 with advanced/fatal disease) diagnosed 2000 to 2014 and 3,296 matched controls. We will use pre-            existing data from genome-wide association studies to investigate genetic variants in circadian genes and known prostate cancer risk loci with 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels. Because obesity impairs circadian rhythm, we will use anthropometric data to explore the extent to which the link between obesity and prostate cancer is driven through altered circadian rhythm. For all analyses, a primary goal is to formally compare and contrast the associations by race/ethnicity.  The hypothesis that disruption of circadian rhythms is a risk factor for prostate cancer is promising, but has been addressed somewhat superficially; there are only sparse data from the few studies of advanced disease and no study has been conducted within a racially/ethnically diverse population. However, the careful investigation of this novel hypothesis in the proposed study could substantially increase our understanding of modifiable risk factors for prostate cancer, especially for aggressive disease, and also specifically identify risk factors that contribute to disparities. The results of this study are highly translational (potentially by alterng melatonin levels and sleep patterns), and could illuminate opportunities for primary and secondary prevention. Moreover, the utilization of a large established cohort with pre-existing genetic data makes this study highly efficient and cost-effective.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our study aims to investigate circadian disruption as a risk factor for prostate cancer in a multiethnic cohort, a study noteworthy since African-American men are more likely to be diagnosed and are twice as likely to die of the disease compared to white men. Using an integrative molecular epidemiological approach, we aim to evaluate the interplay between common variation in circadian related genes, a urinary biomarker of melatonin levels, race/ethnicity and obesity on prostate cancer risk. The goal is to provide epidemiological data that could be translated into primary and secondary prostate cancer prevention, and potentially novel avenues for prostate cancer therapy.

"(PQ3) AGEs and Race Specific Tumor Immune Response in Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AGEs and Race Specific Tumor Immune Response in Prostate Cancer African American (AA) prostate cancer patients are more likely to die of their disease than any other race or ethnic group in the US. Here in South Carolina (SC), age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates are 78% higher among AA men than EA men and mortality rates three times higher. While quality of care issues and socioeconomic status clearly contribute to cancer health disparities it is becoming increasing clear that molecular and genetic differences in tumor biology also play a critical role. Glycation is the non-enzymatic glycosylatio of sugars with proteins, lipids and DNA that lead to the production of reactive metabolites called advanced glycation end products (AGE's). AGEs accumulate in our tissues as we age to promote diseases associated with growing older such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Glycation occurs during normal metabolism but factors associated with cancer disparity such as poor diet and a lack of exercise significantly increase the accumulation of AGEs in our bodies. This study will conduct mechanistic research to investigate AGE accumulation as a biological consequence of the factors known to contribute to prostate cancer disparity. Our recent studies have led to our hypothesis that: ""Race specific elevations in AGEs alter tumor associated immune responses in prostate cancer"". AGEs function as a ligand activator for RAGE which is expressed on the surface of most immune cells. RAGE stimulation by AGE induces the transcriptional activation of a number of factors critical for the generation of an inflammatory environment including NFkB, STAT3 and HIF1a (4-6). Such activation results in the expression of immune associated cytokines such as IL1, IL6 and TNFa which are critical for mediating crosstalk between cancer cells and the stroma. Aim 1 will use primary and immortalized race specific cell line models to define the mechanistic implications of AGEs to the immune response. Aim 2 will use mouse models fed high and low AGE diets to determine the contribution of dietary AGEs to immune response and prostate cancer growth in vivo. The concept suggesting that AGE metabolites may represent a biological consequence of cancer disparity is a novel approach to explaining the increased incidence and mortality figures observed within specific populations. Associating the mechanistic links between glycation and altered immune response has also not been examined especially within the context of a race specific background or the prostate tumor microenvironment. By identifying a molecular consequence of cancer health disparity this study may contribute to reducing the cancer incidence and mortality rates among minority populations and identify novel potential biomarkers and define a novel area of therapeutic potential. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Factors such poor/unhealthy diet and a lack of exercise are more prevalent in African American men, increase AGE accumulation in our bodies and alter immune responses. Due to the higher complications and deaths associated with prostate cancer in African American men, a greater understanding of the mechanistic contribution of AGEs to tumor associated immune response and cancer disparity may contribute to reducing cancer incidence and mortality rates among minority populations, identify novel potential biomarkers and define a novel area of therapeutic potential. Given the potential benefits of lifestyle changes and the role of dietary-AGE in promoting disease phenotypes, opportunities exist for impacting cancer prevention initiatives arising through health and nutritional education and community outreach.",(PQ3) AGEs and Race Specific Tumor Immune Response in Prostate Cancer,9064086,R21CA194469,"['Age ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exercise ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Metabolic Glycosylation ', ' glycosylation ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' lymphocyte activating factor ', ' T Helper Factor ', ' Macrophage Cell Factor ', ' Lymphocyte-Stimulating Hormone ', ' Interleukin I ', ' IL1 ', ' IL-1 ', ' Interleukin-1 ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Ligands ', ' Lipids ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' South Carolina ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Cultured Tumor Cells ', ' Cultured Neoplastic Cells ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Generations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Advanced Glycosylation End Products ', ' advanced glycation endproduct ', ' Advanced Glycation End Products ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Epithelial ', ' Failure ', ' European ', ' sugar ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Figs ', ' Figs -

"Biological and Environmental modifiers of Vitamin D3 and Prostate Cancer Risk  ABSTRACT Disparities in prostate cancer (Pca) are caused by complex interactions of genetic susceptibility, individual risk factors, and environmental factors. Pca is the second leading cause of death among all men; however African American (AA) men have the highest mortality rate of Pca of any racial/ethnic group in the U.S. This difference in mortality accounts for 44% of the overall cancer mortality disparity between AA and European-American (EA) men. Thus, there is a critical need to explore the etiologic pathways that contribute to this disparity. Unfortunately, the only well-established risk factors (age, race and family history) for Pca are non-modifiable. However recent studies have found low levels of vitamin D have been associated with increased Pca risk, and treatment with vitamin D has reduced Pca disease progression in multiple studies. These studies support the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of Pca and that vitamin D is a potential chemopreventive and therapeutic agent. Although genetic and environmental factors including common low penetrant alleles, diet, body mass index (BMI), and vitamin D levels may affect risk, their significance and multiple joint effects are unclear. Extensive data exists in support of a critical role for Vitamin D3 [25(OH) vitamin D] on Pca risk. However, it is difficult to determine its importance mainly because Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin, and serum levels are strongly influenced by skin color, genetic ancestry, age, BMI, and environmental factors such as sunlight exposure and diet. The goal of this project is to explore the effects of serum Vitamin D, UVR exposure, skin color, age, BMI, and genes involved in Vitamin D synthesis, metabolism and signaling on Pca and aggressive Pca risk in a study of 2,000 AA and 2,000 EA men. Men aged 40-79 will be recruited from a consortium of Chicago hospitals including, the University Illinois at Chicago Hospital System, University of Chicago Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, John H. Stroger Cook County Hospital, and the Jesse Brown Veteran Affairs Medical Center. This project will improve our understanding of the role Vitamin D plays on prostate cancer susceptibility, specifically among African Americans, and if lower vitamin D levels in AAs account for a portion of the disparity in Pca incidence and mortality between AAs and EAs. More importantly, given that UVR and diet are general environmental exposures that can be easily modified, understanding their impact may have broad health implications.  NARRATIVE Vitamin D has been shown to induce differentiation of prostate cells and to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. There has been epidemiologic evidence linking vitamin D status to breast, colon and prostate cancer. Prospective studies have been lacking and among the literature there have been inconclusive results. Notably, these studies are lacking in numbers of men of African ancestry who are likely to have aggressive prostate cancer and to be more vitamin D deficient. Also the studies fail to look at the interaction of vitamin D level, sun exposure, skin color, and genetic variation in genes in the vitamin D synthesis and metabolism pathway. Here we will propose a prospective study of serum vitamin D (25-OH D) levels and prostate cancer risk among African American and European American men aged 40-79. The study will be conducted at five Chicago area institutions, the University Illinois at Chicago Hospital System, University of Chicago Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, John H.

"Mitochondria in Prostate Cancer Diversity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The androgen receptor (AR) plays an important role in normal development of the prostate gland, in prostate carcinogenesis, and in the progression of prostate cancer to advanced metastatic disease. Traditional thinking is that AR localizes exclusively to the nucleus and that nuclear AR regulates genes that are essential to prostate cancer development. This is true. However, we demonstrate a previously unrecognized function of AR in mitochondria. We have discovered that AR 1) directly localizes into the mitochondria and 2) indirectly transcriptionally regulates nuclear genes whose products localize into mitochondria and perform mitochondrial functions. Our studies reveal that i) AR localizes into mitochondria in primary prostate tissues and cell lines, ii) AR is imported into isolated mitochondria, and iii) AR contains a mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) capable of targeting foreign proteins, such as green fluorescent protein, into mitochondria. Indirectly, AR controls expression of a variety of nuclear DNA (nDNA)-encoded mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mtOXPHOS) subunits, including NDUFB8 (Complex I), SDHB (Complex II), UQCRC2 (Complex III), COXII subunit (Complex IV), and ATP5A (Complex V). AR also down-regulates the TFAM, GFM1, and GFM2 genes, which control mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content. Consistent with this, the mtDNA content and the expression of mtDNA-encoded COX II protein is significantly reduced in PC3-AR prostate cells expressing AR. Notably, we demonstrate that the mtDNA content in prostate tumors of African-Americans (AA) is >6 times less than in tumors of Caucasian-Americans (CA). mtDNA content was also lower in normal prostates of AA than CA. To identify the underlying mitochondrial basis of prostate cancer diversity, we conducted comprehensive, race-based bioinformatics analyses of variants in more than 6000 AA and 33,000 CA and discovered, in the AR gene of AA, missense variants located in two domains: the N-terminal domain containing the MLS and the DNA-binding domain. Of note, missense mutations in CA were found only in the hinge domain containing the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of AR. Expression of AR variant S598G in PC3 cells reduced more than the wild type the expression of TFAM, which controls mtDNA content. We hypothesize that AR missense variants/mutants present, solely in AA, contribute to the ""gain"" or ""loss"" of mitochondrial function and thereby to prostate cancer diversity in AA. AIM 1: Determine the prognostic significance of AR missense variants/mutants and mtDNA content on prostate cancer metastasis and reoccurrence in AA and CA. AIM 2: Evaluate the significance of mitochondrial AR missense variants/mutants as direct regulators of mitochondrial functions that affect composition, organization, stability, and activity of mtOXPHOS super-complexes and apoptosis. AIM 3: Evaluate the significance of nuclear AR missense variants/mutants as indirect regulators of mitochondrial function. AIM 4: Use mouse xenograft model to establish the significance of mitochondrial and nuclear AA- and CA-specific AR missense variants/mutants on prostate tumorigenesis and metastasis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our proposed study will characterize a previously uncharacterized mitochondrial mechanism regulated by androgen receptor underlying the prostate cancer aggressiveness in AA men.            ",Mitochondria in Prostate Cancer Diversity,9088696,R01CA204430,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgens ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' mtDNA ', ' Mitochondrial DNA ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Oxidative Phosphorylation Pathway ', ' Oxidative Phosphorylation ', ' Play ', ' chromosome complement ', ' DNA Ploidy ', ' DNA Index ', ' DNA Content ', ' Ploidies ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' transformed cells ', ' cell transformation ', ' oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein ', ' complex V ', ' OSCP protein ', ' ATP50 ATP synthase subunit ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Green Fluorescent Proteins ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Hereditary Mutation ', ' Germline Mutation ', ' Germ-Line Mutation ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Base of the Prostate ', ' Base of Human Prostate ', ' Structure of base of prostate ', ' Genetic ', ' Figs ', ' Figs - dietary ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Complex ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' Nuclear ', ' Nuclear Localization Signal Peptide ', ' NLS Peptide ', ' Nuclear Localization Signal ', ' mutant ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' receptor expression ', ' complex IV ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Ubiquinone-Cytochrome b-c2 Oxidoreductase ', ' Ubiquinol-ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase ', ' Ubiquinol-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Ubihydroquinone-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' QH(2)-Ferricytochrome-c Oxidoreductase ', ' QH(2)-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Dihydroubiquinone-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Cytochrome b-c2 Oxidoreductase ', ' Complex III ', ' Coenzyme QH2-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Coenzyme Q-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Electron Transport Complex III ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Receptor Gene ', ' Address ', ' Basic Cancer Research ', ' DNA-Binding Protein Motifs ', ' DNA Binding Domain ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Xenograft Model ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' mitochondrial genome ', ' early onset ', ' PC3 ', ' PC-3 cell line ', ' PC-3 ', ' PC3 cell line ', ' N-terminal ', ' NH2-terminal ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' prostate carcinogenesis ', ' prostate tumorigenesis ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' prognostic significance ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2016,336263,0.2294814012724256
"Genetic factors for race related prostate cancer. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major problem or barrier is that there are currently no methods or approaches to adequately address prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans. A major question is why do African American men have a higher overall incidence, earlier age of onset, increased proportion of clinically advanced disease and increased bone metastases and mortality from prostate cancer compared to Caucasians? The main goal of this project is to investigate the genetic basis of prostate cancer health disparities The rationale is that prostate cancer is the leading cancer among men of African descent in the USA. Despite more aggressive screening of prostate cancer across all demographics in the United States, disparities among populations persist. A substantial proportion of African American men have a higher overall incidence, earlier age of onset, increased proportion of clinically advanced disease and increased bone metastases and mortality from prostate cancer compared to Caucasians. There are racial disparities in survival after diagnosis of prostate cancer in men. Therefore, prostate cancer incidence and mortality represent a significant public health problem in African American men. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs are significantly altered in prostate cancer. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the differential expression profile of a set of oncogenic miRNAs and tumor suppressor miRNAs in African Americans may target a set of prostate cancer specific genes and may contribute to the prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans. The molecular mechanisms of action of tumor suppressor miRNAs are through repressing oncogenes and activating tumor suppressor genes. We will test these hypotheses through analyses of a series of experiments proposed under our specific aims. All the aims are highly focused, centralized, innovative, clinically significant, functional and mechanistic in nature. Specific Aim # 1. Investigate the role of miRNAs as the genetic basis of prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. Specific Aim # 2. Investigate the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of action of oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs in race-related prostate cancer. Specific Aim # 3. Investigate the molecular mechanisms of differential expression of miRNAs in African Americans and Caucasians. Impact: The present application has high impact because it describes a novel concept and approach that is different and better from the previous attempts since differential expression of a set of miRNAs may explain why African Americans have higher incidence of prostate cancer compared to Caucasians. This project will identify novel miRNAs that can be used as genetic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for race-related prostate cancer.

"Constructing a Relational Bridge to Achieve High-Quality Prostate Cancer Care for African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prostate cancer (PCa) imposes a disproportionate burden on African American men, who have a 63% higher incidence, are more often diagnosed with aggressive disease, and have more than twice the mortality rate of White men. Among the causes of excess mortality is failure to receive definitive treatment (e.g., surgery and radiation) when it would be most beneficial (under-treatment). In addition, over-treatment of low-risk disease (therapies that may not be beneficial yet have serious side effects) contributes to disparities in quality of life, as African American men report more treatment-related side effects that translate to lower quality of life. All of these disparities are most pronounced among low income African American men, many of whom have low health literacy, and receive treatment in low resource settings (e.g., public hospitals and other safety net systems), underscoring the need for targeted research in this setting. PCa treatment options present daunting communication challenges even for high literacy patients, as there are complex trade-offs between survival and quality of life that are very personal. To mitigate this perfect storm of complex treatment options and constraints in communication, we will construct a relational bridge between low income African American men and equal PCa treatment by anchoring the evidence-based intervention of peer navigation in the relational concept of African American brotherhood as a means to foster trust and empowerment, and thus to optimize patient-centered communication and quality of care. Our specific aims are to: (1) develop a multi-dimensional understanding of current PCa care and treatment decision processes among African American safety net patients; (2) adapt an existing peer navigation intervention to empower African American PCa patients as partners in high quality patient-centered PCa care; and (3) pilot test the adapted peer navigation protocol for feasibility and acceptability, and for impact on patient centeredness and treatment chosen. This K01 project will have significant impact by directly targeting multiple elements of PCa treatment quality in a single integrated approach. The candidate, Nynikka Palmer, DrPH, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in General Internal Medicine at San Francisco General Hospital, University of California, San Francisco with secondary appointments in the Departments of Urology and Radiation Oncology. With support from an exceptional mentoring team, and execution of interconnected training and research activities, Dr. Palmer will carry out formal coursework, independent mentored learning, and experiential learning that converge around three key topics: (1) depth in cultural understanding and methods via ethnography, (2) patient-centered health communication intervention development and implementation, and (3) design and conduct of randomized controlled trials. This K01 project will facilitate Dr. Palmer's long-term career goal to become an independent investigator who develops, implements, and disseminates culturally meaningful interventions to improve the quality of cancer care and reduce the burden of PCa among African American men. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American men bear an excess burden of prostate cancer that can be attributed in part to disparities in optimal treatment, which are exacerbated by low levels of health literacy among patients treated in low resource settings where time constraints and communication barriers degrade quality of care. The goal of the proposed training and research is to address these barriers by bridging the divide between low-income African American men and equal prostate cancer treatment with the evidence-based intervention of peer navigation adapted through the relational concept of African American brotherhood as a means to foster trust and empowerment, and thus to optimize patient-centered communication and quality of care.",Constructing a Relational Bridge to Achieve High-Quality Prostate Cancer Care for African Americans,9385731,K01CA211965,"['men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Urology ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Caring ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Survivors ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Research Activity ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' treatment planning ', ' Familiarity ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Radiation ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' active method ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' safety net ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' Evidence based intervention ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' PSA screening ', ' PSA test ', ' Appointment ', ' Awareness ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Impotence ', ' impotent ', ' Incidence ', ' Incontinence ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' literacy ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2017,184680,0.13782088229025793
"A Multilevel Intervention to Increase the Participation of African Americans in Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer clinical trials are essential to translating research into tangible benefits for patients, but only a small number of patients enroll in a trial Under-enrollment of minorities is an even greater problem because it limits the generalizability of findings and contributes to treatment disparities. Minority under-enrollment in prostate cancer trials is especially troublesome because of the higher incidence, morbidity, and mortality of this cancer among African American men, as compared to White men. The overall goal of our research is to improve cancer care and reduce racial/ethnic cancer disparities by increasing rates at which African American men with prostate cancer make an informed decision to participate in a trial, based on high-quality communication with their physician. In this application, we propose a theory-based multilevel intervention designed to influence African-American patients' attitudes about physicians and about trials; physicians' attitudes about patients and about trials; and patient-provider clinical interactions in which trials may be discussed. The intervention is designed to improve these outcomes: patient understanding of trials and decisions to participate; physician decisions to discuss and offer trials; patient-physician communication; and ultimately, participation rates among African Americans with prostate cancer. We base the intervention on our prior research showing that patient and physician attitudes and beliefs often result in trials not being discussed during clinic visits, or when trials are discussed, communication is ineffective. These factors are even greater in racially discordant visits, and likely contribute to low trial enrollment among African Americans. We will conduct the proposed research at two NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers that provide care in urban areas. African American and White men will be included to allow comparison of the effects of the intervention by patient race. The intervention has two phases. Phase 1 is a randomized trial in which intervention group patients receive a tool to improve their attitudes about trials and increase their active participation in clinic visits in which trials maybe discussed. Phase 2 is an interrupted time series quasi-experiment in which physicians receive an intervention to improve their attitudes about trials and their communication during discussions of trials with patients. Data will include patient and physician self-reports, video recordings of patient-physician clinic visits, and medical records. We propose three Specific Aims: 1) determine the independent and combined effects of each phase of the intervention on outcomes; 2) compare the effects of the intervention on outcomes for African American versus White men; and 3) examine the extent to which patient-physician communication mediates the relationship between the intervention and outcomes. This research is highly significant and innovative because it tests a new conceptual model focusing on patients, physicians, and clinical interactions, and uses social psychological and communication theory to improve clinical practice. Findings should provide evidence for a practical, exportable intervention to increase trial enrollment among African American men with prostate cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinical trials are necessary to make progress in preventing and treating prostate and other cancers. Clinical trials to benefit a large, diverse community, members of majority and minority populations must participate, but minorities are underrepresented.

"Multidiciplinary Integrative Genomic Approach to Distinguish Lethal from Indolent Prostate Cancer in Men of Europena and African Ancestry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are several critical unmet needs in the management of localized prostate cancer. Central among them is the development of minimally invasive tools to distinguish localized cancers that are truly indolent from cancers that are progressive and potentially lethal. To address this key need, we first propose to perform an integrated, multi-dimensional genomic, epigenomic and expression analysis to uncover novel molecular pathways that characterize indolent vs. aggressive prostate cancers. In this approach we define indolent tumors as those screen detected (e.g. PSA screening) lesions that are Gleason score 6 (or less) that are organ confined at radical prostatectomy. We consider these tumors indolent as they do not appear capable of metastasis. In contrast, we equate Gleason score 8-10 tumors as ""interval"" or symptomatic since, even with primary treatment, these tumors often recur and metastasize at high frequencies. Additionally, we will validate our key markers/pathways discovered in this project using additional populations with long term outcomes. We hypothesize that our multi-modality genomic-based integrated approach, contrasting these two divergent tumor types, will reveal signatures that distinguish cancers with dichotomous phenotypes. We also hypothesize that these signatures will vary based on race and thus in parallel we will comprehensively characterize African American prostate cancers to reveal molecular features driving racial disparities in outcomes. We will validate the signatures obtained using large cohorts of cases with established outcomes including: (1) the Johns Hopkins Active surveillance cohort and (2) Prostate cancer cases from the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), an observational cohort of men followed since 1954 with autopsy documented indolent or aggressive/lethal disease. We also propose that these signatures will be able to predict outcomes of cancers with indeterminate kinetics and propose to test this through analysis of cases of intermediate risk prostate cancer with long-term follow-up and known outcomes from Johns Hopkins and in collaboration with colleagues from Harvard, from the Physician's Health and Health Professionals follow-up studies. Together this work will yield highly relevant information that can be directly applied to the clinical management of localized prostate cancer. Specifically, it will yield an integrated signature that distinguishes localized - indolent tumors from localized tumors with lethal potential. Additionally we believe these signatures will be critical in determining treatment strategies for individuals with prostate cancers of indeterminate kinetics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The key unmet need in the management of prostate cancers pivots around the dilemma of the screen detected tumor as clinicians balance over treating cancers that are indolent with delaying/under-treating cancers that are aggressive and pose harm. Nomograms containing clinical and pathologic variables are helpful but additional minimally invasive methods are needed to improve their predictive capabilities. This project, which will comprehensively characterization prostate cancers and their microenvironment from both Caucasian and African American men, will inform unique pathways that modulate these two states and allow the development of novel minimally invasive tools that improve patient care.",Multidiciplinary Integrative Genomic Approach to Distinguish Lethal from Indolent Prostate Cancer in Men

"Multidiciplinary Integrative Genomic Approach to Distinguish Lethal from Indolent Prostate Cancer in Men of Europena and African Ancestry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are several critical unmet needs in the management of localized prostate cancer. Central among them is the development of minimally invasive tools to distinguish localized cancers that are truly indolent from cancers that are progressive and potentially lethal. To address this key need, we first propose to perform an integrated, multi-dimensional genomic, epigenomic and expression analysis to uncover novel molecular pathways that characterize indolent vs. aggressive prostate cancers. In this approach we define indolent tumors as those screen detected (e.g. PSA screening) lesions that are Gleason score 6 (or less) that are organ confined at radical prostatectomy. We consider these tumors indolent as they do not appear capable of metastasis. In contrast, we equate Gleason score 8-10 tumors as ""interval"" or symptomatic since, even with primary treatment, these tumors often recur and metastasize at high frequencies. Additionally, we will validate our key markers/pathways discovered in this project using additional populations with long term outcomes. We hypothesize that our multi-modality genomic-based integrated approach, contrasting these two divergent tumor types, will reveal signatures that distinguish cancers with dichotomous phenotypes. We also hypothesize that these signatures will vary based on race and thus in parallel we will comprehensively characterize African American prostate cancers to reveal molecular features driving racial disparities in outcomes. We will validate the signatures obtained using large cohorts of cases with established outcomes including: (1) the Johns Hopkins Active surveillance cohort and (2) Prostate cancer cases from the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), an observational cohort of men followed since 1954 with autopsy documented indolent or aggressive/lethal disease. We also propose that these signatures will be able to predict outcomes of cancers with indeterminate kinetics and propose to test this through analysis of cases of intermediate risk prostate cancer with long-term follow-up and known outcomes from Johns Hopkins and in collaboration with colleagues from Harvard, from the Physician's Health and Health Professionals follow-up studies. Together this work will yield highly relevant information that can be directly applied to the clinical management of localized prostate cancer. Specifically, it will yield an integrated signature that distinguishes localized - indolent tumors from localized tumors with lethal potential. Additionally we believe these signatures will be critical in determining treatment strategies for individuals with prostate cancers of indeterminate kinetics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The key unmet need in the management of prostate cancers pivots around the dilemma of the screen detected tumor as clinicians balance over treating cancers that are indolent with delaying/under-treating cancers that are aggressive and pose harm. Nomograms containing clinical and pathologic variables are helpful but additional minimally invasive methods are needed to improve their predictive capabilities. This project, which will comprehensively characterization prostate cancers and their microenvironment from both Caucasian and African American men, will inform unique pathways that modulate these two states and allow the development of novel minimally invasive tools that improve patient care.",Multidiciplinary Integrative Genomic Approach to Distinguish Lethal from Indolent Prostate Cancer in Men

"Disparities in care of prostate cancer survivors, a population-based cohort study ABSTRACT The burden of prostate cancer (PCa) is substantial, and racial disparities in PCa are the largest in all of oncology. Disparities in PCa screening, diagnosis and treatment have been well-documented; however, while PCa is often slow-growing and patients face a long journey after diagnosis, prior disparities research has largely neglected the vast majority of this journey in the 3.3 million PCa survivors in the US. To optimize overall health and survival, PCa survivors need longitudinal, guideline-recommended healthcare during survivorship. The two most common causes of mortality in men with PCa are 1) cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 2) prostate cancer. There is an urgent need to study disparities in survivorship care, and it is likely that disparities in receipt of guideline-recommended care in PCa survivors directly contribute to the known disparities in mortality in this population. The National Academy of Medicine and American Society of Clinical Oncology have both called for more cancer survivorship research, a high-priority but understudied research area. This study breaks new ground in disparities research by examining survivorship care specific to CVD care and PCa monitoring. It leverages a unique, population-based, and diverse cohort of 1,455 PCa survivors enrolled at diagnosis from 2011-2013 and followed longitudinally with yearly surveys and medical records, with an innovative linkage to administrative and claims data from multiple insurance plans and health care systems, allowing unique insight into disparities in survivorship care by race, insurance/system type (Medicare/Medicaid/private/VA/uninsured), and urban/rural residence. This novel, comprehensive dataset with 3 data sources to measure survivorship care (patient report, medical records, claims) will allow the study team to achieve these specific aims: (1) To examine guideline-recommended PCa-specific survivorship care, including monitoring for PCa recurrence by race, insurance type, and patient rurality; (2) To examine guideline- recommended primary and preventive care – emphasizing cardiovascular disease management and prevention – by race, insurance type, and patient rurality; and (3) To examine data source concordance – patient-report vs medical records vs claims – for guideline-recommended survivorship care, to inform the research methodology for future studies in this area. The anticipated outcomes of this study are to provide novel insight regarding disparities in cancer survivorship care that are directly amenable to intervention; and address fundamental methodologic questions in disparities research on cancer survivorship, made possible by this study's unique dataset. All specific aims directly address known current knowledge gaps in this research area. The research team has extensive experience and expertise with cancer disparities research, analysis of large datasets (including cancer registry and claims data), and designing interventions to reduce disparities and improve the healthcare and overall health of cancer survivors. We will leverage this expertise and findings from this study to design and test interventions targeting disparities in survivorship care as the next step. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT This study addresses a major public health problem –racial disparities in prostate cancer mortality– through a novel examination of the healthcare received by survivors specifically related to the two most common causes of mortality in this patient population: cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer. With 3.3 million prostate cancer survivors in the US, and the high prevalence, morbidity and mortality burden from prostate cancer and cardiovascular disease especially affecting racial minority and rural patients, this study will reveal novel potential targets for intervention to reduce disparities and improve the health and survival of cancer survivors.","Disparities in care of prostate cancer survivors, a population-based cohort study",9471130,R21MD012465,"['Academy ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Hypercholesteremia ', ' hypercholesterolemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Medical Records ', ' Medicine ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methodological Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Genetics of Prostate Cancer in Africa ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most common cancer in men of African descent worldwide. African Americans (AA) suffer from the highest rates of CaP in the world, with an average annual incidence rate of 229 per 100,000 in the period 2006-2010 (SEER). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) GLOBOCAN program estimates that CaP is also the leading cancer in terms of incidence and mortality in men from Africa and the Caribbean. AA men experience the highest rate of aggressive CaP and CaP-specific mortality of any ethnic group in the US. IARC also predicts that CaP deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will almost double from 55,522 in 2010 to 105,758 by 2030 (i.e., more than twice as many deaths as in the US). While men of African descent around the world suffer disproportionately from CaP compared to men of other races or ethnicities, our understanding of the reasons for these disparities remains incomplete. To date, few exposure, lifestyle, or environmental influences have been identified in CaP etiology. In contrast, CaP is among the most heritable of common cancers, and over 90 susceptibility loci have been identified. However, many of these loci have not been replicated in AA, in part because of limited African descent sample sizes, incomplete capture of African alleles, and a limited understanding of African genomic architecture.  To better understand the etiology of CaP in African descent men, we have initiated a large, multicenter consortium known as ""Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate"" (MADCaP). Using resources of this consortium, we propose to undertake a multicenter study of CaP in SSA addressing the following Aims:  Specific Aim 1: Genetic Susceptibility: Discover novel CaP loci and validate known CaP loci in African men to provide new information about the genetic etiology of CaP.  Specific Aim 2. Population Genomics: Evaluate how population differentiation and the recent evolutionary history of African and African American populations inform the underlying reasons for the high rates of CaP in African Americans.  This proposal will identify African alleles influence CaP risk in African populations, and will provide information about the African genome that will be of value to a wide range of genome discovery studies in CaP and other diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer is a significant and under-appreciated public health problem in Africa and represents a critical public health concern in African Americans. We propose to address these concerns by developing a multicenter collaborative structure for prostate cancer research in Africa. Using this infrastructure, we will detect novel African alleles using a genome-wide association approach, evaluate African ancestral genomic relationships and thereby gain knowledge about prostate cancer etiology relevant to men in African and across the African diaspora, including African Americans.",Genetics of Prostate Cancer in Africa,9336266,U01CA184374,"['Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genome ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Link ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' Prostate carcinoma ', ' carcinoma prostatic cancer ', ' Prostatic carcinoma ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' International Agency for Research on Cancer ', ' IARC ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' public health relevance ', ' infrastructure development ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,U01,2017,1707746,0.26346707882784454
"Diagnosing clinically-significant prostate cancer in African American men: Systematic random versus MR-image-fusion guided biopsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most localized prostate cancers (PCa) are indolent and will never become aggressive during a patient's lifetime. Many of these patients could benefit from active surveillance (AS), but uncertainty about their individual risk prompts them to choose radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy, which can negatively impact quality of life, with only ~10% of patients in the US electing AS. Among the key barriers that prevent a more widespread adoption of AS is the fact that the current 12-core systematic random prostate needle diagnostic biopsy (SR-Bx) protocol can miss areas of more advanced disease already present in the prostate in ~30% of patients, thus introducing under-staging and under-grading error at the time of diagnosis. This error seems to be higher among African-American (AA) men, who are at a disproportionally higher risk of developing aggressive PCa and of dying of their disease. Specifically, among AA men, existing predictors to determine AS eligibility seem to perform more poorly, the rate of high-grade tumors missed during biopsy is higher, and rates tumor progression while on AS are higher. Therefore, there is an urgent need to test more reliable biopsy approaches to better discriminate men with clinically insignificant disease (CiPCa), who will truly benefit from AS, from those with clinically significant PCa (CSPCa) who require definitive treatment. We have shown that among white men the use of MRI for identifying suspicious lesions and for targeting prostate biopsies to them with MRI-US image-fusion biopsy technique (MRUS-Bx) outperforms SR-Bx in CSPCa detection, cancer core length, cancer rate per core, cancer volume estimation, and detection of anterior cancers (more common among AA men). We now propose to undertake a randomized controlled trial to compare the detection rate of CSPCa between SR-Bx and MRUS-Bx among AA and white men, to provide better clinical tools to discriminate between CSPCa and CiSPCa and thus, in the long term, improve overall survival among AA men. AIM 1: We propose to enroll 400 men (200 AA, 200 white) with elevated PSA (>2.5 ng/mL) and negative digital rectal exam across 5 academic institutions and 1 private practice. Men will be randomized into two arms: 1) SR-Bx (12 cores) with an MRI 3-months after biopsy for men without CSPCa; 2) pre-biopsy MRI with MRUS- Bx (2 cores/lesion) for men MRI visible lesions (PIRADS > 3). We will compare biopsy detection rate of CSPCa and CiSPCa. AIM 2: we will validate among men who elect RP (~110 in the RCT) the accuracy of MRUS-Bx based on the agreement with findings from step-sectioned RP specimens. AIM 3: we will identify among men invited to participate and those enrolled in the RCT, determinants of a) study participation and b) treatment decision (AS vs radiation vs RP), and c) compare morbidity associated with either SR-Bx vs MRUS-Bx. The results of our study may change the standard of care and improve accuracy in the diagnosis of PCa among asymptomatic men, which will increase confidence in making the correct treatment decision (definitive treatment versus active surveillance), particularly AA men with PCa who are at the greatest disadvantage. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will validate a novel protocol for the diagnosis of prostate cancer among asymptomatic men that has the potential to reduce over-diagnosis and increase the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. This approach promises to be especially relevant for African-American men who are at the highest risk of getting prostate cancer, have higher rates of under-diagnosis of aggressive disease, and thus limited eligibility for active surveillance. Therefore, the results of this study have the potentia to change the standard of practice for diagnosis of localized PCA, reduce overtreatment, and reduce disparities in cancer detection and management among African-Americans.",Diagnosing clinically-significant prostate cancer in African American men: Systematic random versus MR-image-fusion guided biopsy,9344560,R01CA205058,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Goals ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Needles ', ' Patients ', ' Private Practice ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' rectal ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Lesion ', ' Indolent ', ' Individual ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' success ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Reporting ', ' Radiation ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Length ', ' Detection ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Clinical Management ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' prostate biopsy ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,514292,0.17208307638421996
"Circadian Disruption and Risk of Prostate Cancer in a Multiethnic Cohort ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 1.1 million men are diagnosed with prostate cancer globally and causing 300,000 cancer-specific deaths each year. The impact is particularly profound for African-American men who suffer significantly increased mortality rates. The sources of these substantial prostate cancer disparities are unclear. Our application focuses on disruption of circadian rhythms and prostate cancer risk in a racially/ethnically diverse cohort. The rationale is based on the classification of nightshift work as a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a proposed mechanism through circadian disruption. Our preliminary data from cohorts of white men show that several key components of circadian disruption, including low melatonin, increased sleep disruption, and variation in circadian genes, all are linked with with higher risk of advanced prostate cancer. African-American men have altered circadian rhythms and low melatonin compared to men of other races. We propose an integrative molecular epidemiology study of circadian disruption to investigate the association between circadian disruption and prostate cancer risk, and the extent to which circadian disruption explains racial disparities.  The study will be nested among men in the prospective Multiethnic Cohort (MEC), ongoing since 1993 and including Latino, African-American, Hawaiian, Japanese and white men. We will measure pre-diagnostic urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, the primary metabolite of melatonin, among 1,648 prostate cancer cases (N=801 with advanced/fatal disease) diagnosed 2000 to 2014 and 3,296 matched controls. We will use pre-            existing data from genome-wide association studies to investigate genetic variants in circadian genes and known prostate cancer risk loci with 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels. Because obesity impairs circadian rhythm, we will use anthropometric data to explore the extent to which the link between obesity and prostate cancer is driven through altered circadian rhythm. For all analyses, a primary goal is to formally compare and contrast the associations by race/ethnicity.  The hypothesis that disruption of circadian rhythms is a risk factor for prostate cancer is promising, but has been addressed somewhat superficially; there are only sparse data from the few studies of advanced disease and no study has been conducted within a racially/ethnically diverse population. However, the careful investigation of this novel hypothesis in the proposed study could substantially increase our understanding of modifiable risk factors for prostate cancer, especially for aggressive disease, and also specifically identify risk factors that contribute to disparities. The results of this study are highly translational (potentially by alterng melatonin levels and sleep patterns), and could illuminate opportunities for primary and secondary prevention. Moreover, the utilization of a large established cohort with pre-existing genetic data makes this study highly efficient and cost-effective. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our study aims to investigate circadian disruption as a risk factor for prostate cancer in a multiethnic cohort, a study noteworthy since African-American men are more likely to be diagnosed and are twice as likely to die of the disease compared to white men. Using an integrative molecular epidemiological approach, we aim to evaluate the interplay between common variation in circadian related genes, a urinary biomarker of melatonin levels, race/ethnicity and obesity on prostate cancer risk. The goal is to provide epidemiological data that could be translated into primary and secondary prostate cancer prevention, and potentially novel avenues for prostate cancer therapy.",Circadian

"Provider Characteristics and Quality of Prostate Cancer Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Assessment of comparative effectiveness of treatment is essential to achieve optimal quality of care [1-2]. Quality of care in healthcare is a multifaceted issue that involves factors related to patient, provider, health care system, community and environment [1-16]. Disparities exist in the quality of prostate cancer care across geographic regions, hospitals, age and racial and ethnic groups [17-23], including treatment variability among comparable patients [17-19, 24-27]. The objective of our study is to analyze the complex interplay of personal factors, clinical factors, provider factors and their relationship with variation in quality of care and heterogeneity of treatment among men with prostate cancer (localized or advanced). Specific aims are: (1): To assess the contribution of provider (hospital and physician) characteristics in the observed disparities (race/ethnicity and disability status) in process of care (type of treatment, time to treatment and diagnostic procedures), and outcomes (short-term and long-term), among prostate cancer patients; (2) To assess the contribution of patient and provider characteristics in the heterogeneous treatment effects among prostate cancer patients; (3) To assess the contribution of continuity of care to the disparity in quality of care (process of care and outcomes) and the heterogeneous treatment effects among prostate cancer patients. To accomplish these aims, we propose a retrospective cohort control design study using the SEER-Medicare linked data. All African American, Asian, Hispanic, and Caucasian men, diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1995 and 2012 (n=282,487) will be identified and followed retrospectively for one year pre-diagnosis and up to fifteen years post-diagnosis. Physician and hospital characteristics will be determined by linkage to the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Hospital Association (AHA) annual survey, respectively. Our main comparators are various treatments for localized or advanced prostate cancer. We will use multilevel modeling approach. First, we will study the association of hospital characteristics with racial and ethnic disparity in process of care and outcomes. Next, we will analyze the contribution made by physician characteristics to racial and ethnic disparity in process of care and outcomes. Finally, we will investigate the role played by continuity of care in the observed racial and ethnic disparity in process of care and outcomes. We will use propensity score and instrumental variable approaches to minimize measured and unmeasured biases. Our study proposes a novel systems approach for analyzing the complex interplay of provider characteristics and their relationship with racial and ethnic disparities in process of care and outcomes among prostate cancer patients. The study results will aid in development of micro and macro level treatment, care and payment policies to address disparity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Assessment of comparative effectiveness of treatment is essential to achieve optimal quality of care. Quality of care in healthcare is a multifaceted issue that involves factors related to patient, provider, health care system, community and environment. Treatment heterogeneity effect can lead to sub-optimal treatment outcomes and ultimately impair patient's quality of care. The objective of our study is to analyze the complex interplay of personal factors, clinical factors, provider factors and their relationship with variaion in quality of care and heterogeneity of treatment among men with prostate cancer (localized or advanced) using SEER-Medicare, AMA and AHA databases.",Provider Characteristics and Quality of Prostate Cancer Care,9226004,R01HS024106,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,227067,0.30342612778702294
"Decision Aids to Address Prostate Cancer Disparities in Minority Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American and some Native American men experience a greater burden of prostate cancer in the United States. Surgery and radiation therapy are effective treatments, but each has different quality of life implications for men and their partners. These treatments, although potentially life-saving impose their own burden related to treatment side effects. Some men may benefit from a monitoring approach called ""active surveillance"" if they have early, slow-growing prostate cancer. Making the right treatment choice depends of men being given all appropriate options and making sure they have a high quality conversation with their specialty provider. Minority men in particular are not always given the evidence they need to make the right choice for them, and doctors and healthcare systems may not always pay attention to what is important to them. Tools called ""decision aids"" can improve knowledge and may reduce the burden associated with prostate cancer treatment in minority men. These tools inform men about their disease severity, treatment options, and the quality of life implications of each treatment option. They can be delivered in clinical discussion with specialists or prior to a visit with a specialist. However, decision aids are not routinely usd in specialty practice for prostate cancer. A tablet-based tool we have developed, Prostate Choice, helps men tailor their choice based on their disease risk, life expectancy, and current sexual and urinary function. It can be used in the clinical conversation. Another tool, Knowing Your Options, is a website with comprehensive educational materials that is designed for use prior to visits with specialists. We want to study two kinds of decision aids - ones delivered in te visit with a specialist and one delivered before seeing a specialist as well as the combination of the two decision aids-to see if we can put patients in the best position possible to make the treatment choice that is right for them. We think these tools will reduce known disparities in patient knowledge and may improve the burden of men's symptoms a year after prostate cancer diagnosis. We propose an experiment that delivers the two types of decision aids compared to usual care by assigning 32 specialty practices to get different types of decision aids or usual care. To test the experiment we will enroll 310 men (120 white, 120 African American, 70 American Indian/Alaska Native). From this experiment we will see whether one or the other of the two proposed decision aids or the combination of the two improves men's knowledge most compared to usual care. We will be able to determine whether those effects are the same or different for men from different racial backgrounds and education levels. By testing these tools we will determine whether they can reduce known disparities in patient knowledge and quality of life in minority men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among the more than 200,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, minority men face significant disparities in disease severity, knowledge about treatment options and implications, survival and symptom burden. Decision aids delivered within or prior to specialty visits or the combination might help reduce disparities by improving patient knowledge, and allowing them to make a treatment choice that is appropriate and that fits with their priorities related to sexual and urinary function. This proposal will test in-visit, out-of-vsit and combined in-visit/out-of-visit decision aids for African-American and American Indian/Alaska Native men for initial prostate cancer treatment decisions in a cancer cooperative group.",Decision Aids to Address Prostate Cancer Disparities in Minority Men,9252305,R01MD008934,"['Affect ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' literacy ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Regrets ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Mediating ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' tool ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' System ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' urinary ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' health information technology ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' tablet device ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' treatment choice ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' web-based tool ', ' ']",NIMHD,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2017,358055,0.1926486048293844
"CANCER RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. African- American men are disproportionately impacted by prostate cancer and exhibit the highest incidence and mortality rate in the world. The underlying reasons for significant prostate cancer health disparities in African- American men are not clearly understood and may include both biological and socio-economic factors. The RCMl program has helped Clark Atlanta University (CAU) to establish the Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD), a premier research program in prostate cancer. CCRTD focuses on understanding prostate cancer health disparities and has successfully trained the next generation of minority scientists in the area of prostate cancer and developed a community-based educational and research program focusing on the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. In this RCMl renewal application, we propose to enhance, improve and manage our research programs to increase efficient use of technologies, increase research capacity and competitiveness and expand our network through collaborations and partnerships with researchers, research institutes and community organizations. We propose the following specific aims to achieve our goals: 1) To recruit and support additional scientists to build a competitive basic and translational research center focused on prostate cancer health disparities and 2) To maintain and expand the existing research infrastructure within CCRTD. To achieve the specific aims, we plan to focus on two primary activities: a) Administrative Core Activity and b) Technologies and Resources for Core Laboratories Activity. Under the Administrative Core Activity, our key focus areas will be i) Collaborations and Partnerships; ii) Professional Development Activities; iii) Evaluation Plan; iv) Recruitment and Hiring of Additional Faculty Investigators/Research Staff; and v) Pilot Project Program. RCMl funding is vital for the continued development of biomedical research infrastructure at CAU in general and to assist CCRTD in expanding its focus on prostate cancer, a disease that disproportionately impacts African Americans.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer affects the African-American community disproportionately.

"Modulation of host intrinsic immunity to reduce prostate cancer disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer health disparities represent a major public health concern in the United States. Even when socioeconomic factors are accounted for, minority populations have higher overall incidence rates and worse outcomes than the overall population. Prostate cancer is one such disease with higher incidence and death rates in African American (AA) men than Caucasians. Although socioeconomic factors may be blamed to a certain extent, it is appreciated that the genetic composition makes AA men more susceptible to aggressive prostate cancer. Genetic and epigenetic changes are known as tumorigenic drivers because epigenetic editing precludes mounting of host antitumor response necessary for tumor cell clearance. DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), is the best-characterized epigenetic modification in prostate cancer, and racial disparities in DNA methylation are associated with cancer prognosis and survival. Therefore, targeting of DNMT to reverse epigenetic alterations is an appealing therapeutic target, and vital to reduce the observed prostate cancer outcome gaps among AA men and Caucasians. The deoxycytidine analogue decitabine is unique in that it can be repositioned for non-cytotoxic depletion of DNMT. We characterized a low dose of decitabine with its increased absorption in the presence of tetrahydrouridine (THU). Combination of THU with decitabine changes its pharmacology, and facilitates non-cytotoxic DNMT1 depletion. We demonstrated that the THU-decitabine combination significantly inhibits the growth of TRAMP-C2 prostate tumors in immune competent mice, and the addition of CpG immunotherapy further enhanced antitumor immunity. Based on our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that THU-decitabine directed epigenetic therapy revitalize the host intrinsic immunity and augment vaccine-induced antitumor response. Since DNA methylation is prevalent and relates to greater risk in AAs, DNMT depletion will invigorate the immune response of tumor-bearing host, providing an opportunity to immunotherapy inducing robust antitumor immunity. We will test the combination of THU-decitabine directed DNMT depletion, immune modulation and therapeutic vaccine to determine 1) the effect of epigenetic editing on prostate cancer cell growth in murine models; and 2) the effector mechanism of THU-decitabine guided vaccine- induced antigen-specific antitumor immunity in complete regression of early and advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. This project is novel because the concept of a non-toxic THU-decitabine combination with immunotherapy has not been tested in any cancer type. This combinatorial approach will significantly attenuate the growth of aggressive prostate cancer as often presented in AA men, and may represent a novel treatment to reduce prostate cancer disparity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer is the second highest cause of cancer related deaths for men in the United States. However, the unfortunate fact is that the African American men are disproportionally affected by prostate cancer with considerably high incidence and as much as twice the mortality rate than Caucasians. Determining the significance of the host immunity reconstitution following combination approaches of epigenetics editing and immunotherapy in race based prostate cancer is the major goal of this study. If our efficacy aims are achieved, the excellent safety profile of our non-cytotoxic regimen conducive to translate to humans is very promising aimed to reduce prostate cancer disparity.",Modulation

"Chemical markers of heterocyclic aromatic amines for human biomonitoring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and second leading cause of cancer-related death among men in the United States. Identifying risk factors of this disease and developing strategies for prevention are critical. A number of epidemiologic studies have reported an association between frequent consumption of well-done cooked meats, containing the heterocyclic aromatic amine (HAA) 2-amino-1-methyl- 6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and prostate cancer risk. PhIP is a potent rodent prostate carcinogen, and it induces oxidative stress, atrophy of the acini, and inflammation of the prostate. These are critical features that occur in human prostate carcinogenesis. A paradigm has been put forth for a causal role of consumption of well-done cooked meats containing PhIP (and other HAAs) in the etiology of prostate cancer; however, biomarkers of exposure and DNA damage are lacking to validate this model.  Our long-term goal is to assess the cancer risk posed by HAAs, by employing chemical markers that may distinguish individuals at different levels of risk. In this grant renewal, our objective is to assess dietary exposure to PhIP and its potential to induce damage to DNA in the prostate in relation to other HAAs, meat genotoxicants, and endogenous electrophiles produced in the cell, by employing mass spectrometric (MS)- based methods to measure genotoxicants and identify their biomarkers of DNA damage in the prostate.  We will implement our recently established biomarkers of HAAs and other cooked meat genotoxicants and their DNA adduction products in cohorts of African American and Caucasian men with benign prostate hyper- plasia or prostate cancer who frequently eat well-done cooked meat. In Aim 1) HAA exposure will be assessed by measurement of HAAs accrued in hair; DNA adducts of HAAs, other meat genotoxicants, and endogenous electrophiles, will be determined by different MS scanning methods, in prostate. In Aim 2) Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded prostate tissue, an underutilized biospecimen in biomonitoring DNA damage, will be employed to screen for HAA-DNA adducts in subjects undergoing prostatectomy. Adduct levels will be compared to those values obtained by current but non-specific immunohistochemical techniques. MS methods will also be implemented to measure PhIP-serum albumin adducts as long-lived biomarkers of the biologically effective dose. In Aim 3) we will conduct high density genotyping of genes encoding enzymes involved carcinogen metabolism that may impact DNA damage in the prostate. Prostate HAA-DNA adduct levels will be correlated to HAA levels in hair; the levels of HAA and other DNA adducts in prostate will be correlated to genotypes of phase I and II xenobiotic metabolism enzymes, which impact biological activity.  Our findings will provide direct measurement of DNA damage and assess the relative contribution of HAAs, other cooked meat genotoxicants and endogenous electrophiles to the genetic damage of DNA in the prostate. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cooking of meat well-done produces heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), which are prostate carcinogens in experimental animals and potential human carcinogens. The quantitative measurement of HAA exposure and identification of mutation-prone DNA adducts of HAAs in the human prostate would strengthen the biological plausibility for a role of HAAs in the etiology of prostate cancer. With these data in hand, educational and primary cancer prevention efforts may be devised because there are methods of cooking meats that do not lead to substantial formation of hazardous HAAs.",Chemical markers of heterocyclic aromatic amines for human biomonitoring,9339611,R01CA122320,"['Animals ', ' benign prostate hyperplasia ', ' Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ', ' Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA Injury ', ' DNA Damage ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Hand ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lipid Peroxidation ', ' Lipid Peroxides ', ' Lipoperoxides ', ' Lipid Hydroperoxide ', ' Fatty Acid Hydroperoxides ', ' Meat ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatectomy ', ' Proteins ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Serum Albumin ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' PhIP ', ' 2-Amino-1-Methyl-6-Phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ', ' Measures ', ' Tissue Embedding ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Carcinogen-DNA Adducts ', ' DNA Adducts ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Atrophic ', ' Atrophy ', ' cooking ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Frequencies ', ' human tissue ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' beef ', ' adduct ', ' cancer risk ', ' genotoxicity ', ' diet and cancer ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Controlled Study ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism Analysis ', ' Polymorphism Detection ', ' carcinogenicity ', ' Modeling ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Acinus organ component ', ' acinus ', ' Formalin ', ' Xenobiotic Metabolism ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Dose ', ' DNA Adduction ', ' DNA Adduct Formation ', ' Data ', ' red meat consumption ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Primary Cancer Prevention ', ' Carcinogen Metabolism ', ' Monitor ', ' feeding ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' volunteer ', ' heterocyclic aromatic amines ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' prostate carcinogenesis ', ' prostate tumorigenesis ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' High Fat Diet ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2017,422733,0.30361774924327717
"Genetic Signatures Underlying Prostate Cancer Metastasis in AfricanAmericans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common noncutaneous cancer diagnosed in men in the United States. It is now well established that the incidence and associated mortality and morbidity from PCa shows ethnicity specific disparity, African Americans being disproportionately affected. One major challenge related to management of PCa patients is the variable and often indolent nature of the disease progression. It is difficult to predict whether men diagnosed with PCa will develop aggressive cancer if left untreated or treated with an approach less aggressive than surgery. Most deaths and disabilities from PCa are attributable to the metastatic phase of the disease, for which currently there is no curative therapy. The molecular and cellular underpinnings of PCa metastasis remain poorly understood, multiple-hits acquired from somatic genetic alterations are considered to be important contributing factor. The central hypothesis of this project is that comparing normal, primary and metastatic cancerous prostate tissues from the same patient can identify somatic mutations driving metastasis of PCa. To test this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims for this study: (i) to perform whole exome sequencing of normal, primary tumor and metastatic prostate cancer tissue from 20 African American patients to identify somatic risk variants, mapping the mutated genes and identifying candidates for metastasis; and (ii) To perform in vitro functional characterization of two top-ranked genes identified from specific aim 1 using forced overexpression and knockdown approaches to evaluate their mechanistic impact in driving PCa metastasis. Results from this study will lead to the advancement in our current understanding on the genetic underpinnings of PCa metastasis. PCa metastasis specific biomarkers identified from the results of this study have the potential to be used clinically to screen for, diagnose or monitor the progression of PCa and to guide molecular targeted therapy or assess therapeutic response. Findings from this study may not only be usefully informative for African Americans, but can also provide more generalizable insights into this disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is designed to study the underlying genetic factors for prostate cancer metastasis in African Americans who are known to be disproportionately affected by the disease with poor outcomes. By whole exome sequencing of normal, primary and metastatic cancer tissue from same patient, we will identify genes/pathways driving prostate cancer metastasis. We will then examine the biological role of two top-tier genes in cancer metastasis.",Genetic Signatures Underlying Prostate Cancer Metastasis in AfricanAmericans,9244733,R21CA199171,"['Affect ', ' Archives ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Crystallization ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity -

"African Caribbean Cancer Consortium Conference on Prostate Cancer Advocacy and Survivorship Project Summary/Abstract Black men have consistently had the highest incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer among all race/ethnic groups in the United States. Racial disparities across the prostate cancer survivorship continuum (from the point of diagnosis to long-term survivor) have existed for decades. Prostate cancer survivors with lower income, less education, and African ancestry tend to have poorer QOL and a lower likelihood of survival compared with higher-income, more educated, and white prostate cancer survivors. Prostate cancer survivors often report the lack of accessible quality information to assist with decision-making and symptom management across the cancer continuum and studies suggest unmet information and the need for supportive care is prevalent. Although guidelines exist that specifically address prostate cancer screening and treatment, few structured recommendations exist to optimize the survivorship experience of Black men who have been previously treated for prostate cancer. The African Caribbean Cancer Consortium (AC3) is an NCI-EGRP supported consortium. The AC3’s Prostate Cancer Initiative (PCaI) was birthed as a local initiative led by Philadelphia-based members of the consortium. This multi-institutional partnership between Lincoln University, Fox Chase Cancer Center and Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Jefferson is dedicated to the prevention of premature prostate cancer deaths and excess suffering in the Black community, and is committed to outreach, advocacy, and awareness to reduce the burden of prostate cancer in men and their families. We now seek funding to support a conference that is dedicated primarily to prostate cancer survivorship and quality of life for Black men and their families. The “African Caribbean Cancer Consortium Prostate Cancer Advocacy and Survivorship Conference for Men of African Descent” will be held in Philadelphia PA. The conference is designed to inform prostate cancer survivors and their families and to connect men with a group of cancer survivors, who have common issues, barriers, and histories that will serve to advance a broader level of group consciousness and the recognition that they are not alone. Furthermore, this conference not only addresses the needs of Black prostate cancer survivors and their families but is also viewed as a beginning stage in the establishment of solid partnerships between scientific researchers and community-based advocates to help promote greater levels of cultural sensitivity that can guide evidenced-based interventions. The Specific Aims are: 1) To facilitate knowledge transfer where survivors can exchange and share practical strategies related to cancer risk and outcomes, and promote the development of and coordination of research studies in Black prostate cancer survivorship;2) To promote health equity by providing culturally specific and culturally sensitive research information to the community in order to improve knowledge, awareness of cancer risk and survivorship strategies; 3) To develop a speaker’s bureau and training for survivors to serve as community health educators; and 4) Formation of a Black Prostate Cancer Alliance. Project Narrative This conference will provide emerging cancer survivorship research findings and also provide information to survivors and their families on how they can manage their diagnosis post-treatment. Our approach will ensure that there is cultural sensitivity around developing solutions to the quality of life issues experienced by these men and will inform researchers so that more effective interventions can be developed or adapted to address the concerns of these men.",African Caribbean Cancer Consortium Conference on Prostate Cancer Advocacy and Survivorship,9613669,R13MD013382,"['Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Awareness ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Recommendation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' survivorship ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Advocacy ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' longterm survivors ', ' Long-Term Survivors ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Recovery ', ' African ', ' Funding ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' prostate cancer detection ', ' detect prostate cancer ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' Genetic ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' African Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Directories ', ' Published Directory ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Health Educators ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Cancer Advocacy ', ' Cancer Center ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Fox Chase Cancer Center ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' effective intervention ', ' health equity ', ' screening ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' ']",NIMHD,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R13,2018,50000,0.3406820524434014
"Modulation of host intrinsic immunity to reduce prostate cancer disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer health disparities represent a major public health concern in the United States. Even when socioeconomic factors are accounted for, minority populations have higher overall incidence rates and worse outcomes than the overall population. Prostate cancer is one such disease with higher incidence and death rates in African American (AA) men than Caucasians. Although socioeconomic factors may be blamed to a certain extent, it is appreciated that the genetic composition makes AA men more susceptible to aggressive prostate cancer. Genetic and epigenetic changes are known as tumorigenic drivers because epigenetic editing precludes mounting of host antitumor response necessary for tumor cell clearance. DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), is the best-characterized epigenetic modification in prostate cancer, and racial disparities in DNA methylation are associated with cancer prognosis and survival. Therefore, targeting of DNMT to reverse epigenetic alterations is an appealing therapeutic target, and vital to reduce the observed prostate cancer outcome gaps among AA men and Caucasians. The deoxycytidine analogue decitabine is unique in that it can be repositioned for non-cytotoxic depletion of DNMT. We characterized a low dose of decitabine with its increased absorption in the presence of tetrahydrouridine (THU). Combination of THU with decitabine changes its pharmacology, and facilitates non-cytotoxic DNMT1 depletion. We demonstrated that the THU-decitabine combination significantly inhibits the growth of TRAMP-C2 prostate tumors in immune competent mice, and the addition of CpG immunotherapy further enhanced antitumor immunity. Based on our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that THU-decitabine directed epigenetic therapy revitalize the host intrinsic immunity and augment vaccine-induced antitumor response. Since DNA methylation is prevalent and relates to greater risk in AAs, DNMT depletion will invigorate the immune response of tumor-bearing host, providing an opportunity to immunotherapy inducing robust antitumor immunity. We will test the combination of THU-decitabine directed DNMT depletion, immune modulation and therapeutic vaccine to determine 1) the effect of epigenetic editing on prostate cancer cell growth in murine models; and 2) the effector mechanism of THU-decitabine guided vaccine- induced antigen-specific antitumor immunity in complete regression of early and advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. This project is novel because the concept of a non-toxic THU-decitabine combination with immunotherapy has not been tested in any cancer type. This combinatorial approach will significantly attenuate the growth of aggressive prostate cancer as often presented in AA men, and may represent a novel treatment to reduce prostate cancer disparity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer is the second highest cause of cancer related deaths for men in the United States. However, the unfortunate fact is that the African American men are disproportionally affected by prostate cancer with considerably high incidence and as much as twice the mortality rate than Caucasians. Determining the significance of the host immunity reconstitution following combination approaches of epigenetics editing and immunotherapy in race based prostate cancer is the major goal of this study. If our efficacy aims are achieved, the excellent safety profile of our non-cytotoxic regimen conducive to translate to humans is very promising aimed to reduce prostate cancer disparity.",Modulation

"Genetic factors for race related prostate cancer. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major problem or barrier is that there are currently no methods or approaches to adequately address prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans. A major question is why do African American men have a higher overall incidence, earlier age of onset, increased proportion of clinically advanced disease and increased bone metastases and mortality from prostate cancer compared to Caucasians? The main goal of this project is to investigate the genetic basis of prostate cancer health disparities The rationale is that prostate cancer is the leading cancer among men of African descent in the USA. Despite more aggressive screening of prostate cancer across all demographics in the United States, disparities among populations persist. A substantial proportion of African American men have a higher overall incidence, earlier age of onset, increased proportion of clinically advanced disease and increased bone metastases and mortality from prostate cancer compared to Caucasians. There are racial disparities in survival after diagnosis of prostate cancer in men. Therefore, prostate cancer incidence and mortality represent a significant public health problem in African American men. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs are significantly altered in prostate cancer. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the differential expression profile of a set of oncogenic miRNAs and tumor suppressor miRNAs in African Americans may target a set of prostate cancer specific genes and may contribute to the prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans. The molecular mechanisms of action of tumor suppressor miRNAs are through repressing oncogenes and activating tumor suppressor genes. We will test these hypotheses through analyses of a series of experiments proposed under our specific aims. All the aims are highly focused, centralized, innovative, clinically significant, functional and mechanistic in nature. Specific Aim # 1. Investigate the role of miRNAs as the genetic basis of prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. Specific Aim # 2. Investigate the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of action of oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs in race-related prostate cancer. Specific Aim # 3. Investigate the molecular mechanisms of differential expression of miRNAs in African Americans and Caucasians. Impact: The present application has high impact because it describes a novel concept and approach that is different and better from the previous attempts since differential expression of a set of miRNAs may explain why African Americans have higher incidence of prostate cancer compared to Caucasians. This project will identify novel miRNAs that can be used as genetic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for race-related prostate cancer.

"Decision Aids to Address Prostate Cancer Disparities in Minority Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American and some Native American men experience a greater burden of prostate cancer in the United States. Surgery and radiation therapy are effective treatments, but each has different quality of life implications for men and their partners. These treatments, although potentially life-saving impose their own burden related to treatment side effects. Some men may benefit from a monitoring approach called ""active surveillance"" if they have early, slow-growing prostate cancer. Making the right treatment choice depends of men being given all appropriate options and making sure they have a high quality conversation with their specialty provider. Minority men in particular are not always given the evidence they need to make the right choice for them, and doctors and healthcare systems may not always pay attention to what is important to them. Tools called ""decision aids"" can improve knowledge and may reduce the burden associated with prostate cancer treatment in minority men. These tools inform men about their disease severity, treatment options, and the quality of life implications of each treatment option. They can be delivered in clinical discussion with specialists or prior to a visit with a specialist. However, decision aids are not routinely usd in specialty practice for prostate cancer. A tablet-based tool we have developed, Prostate Choice, helps men tailor their choice based on their disease risk, life expectancy, and current sexual and urinary function. It can be used in the clinical conversation. Another tool, Knowing Your Options, is a website with comprehensive educational materials that is designed for use prior to visits with specialists. We want to study two kinds of decision aids - ones delivered in te visit with a specialist and one delivered before seeing a specialist as well as the combination of the two decision aids-to see if we can put patients in the best position possible to make the treatment choice that is right for them. We think these tools will reduce known disparities in patient knowledge and may improve the burden of men's symptoms a year after prostate cancer diagnosis. We propose an experiment that delivers the two types of decision aids compared to usual care by assigning 32 specialty practices to get different types of decision aids or usual care. To test the experiment we will enroll 310 men (120 white, 120 African American, 70 American Indian/Alaska Native). From this experiment we will see whether one or the other of the two proposed decision aids or the combination of the two improves men's knowledge most compared to usual care. We will be able to determine whether those effects are the same or different for men from different racial backgrounds and education levels. By testing these tools we will determine whether they can reduce known disparities in patient knowledge and quality of life in minority men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among the more than 200,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, minority men face significant disparities in disease severity, knowledge about treatment options and implications, survival and symptom burden.

"Genetic variability in DHFR and folic acid supplementation as novel risk factors for aggressive prostate cancer Folate and its synthetic form, folic acid, is a water-soluble B vitamin which is involved in DNA synthesis and repair, and in regulation of gene expression through DNA methylation as a methyl donor. Despite of confirmed beneficial effect of folate/folic acid supplementation on the prevention of neural tube defect, concerns have been raised recently that folic acid food fortification and high prevalence of folic acid intake with multivitamins and supplements may lead to excessively high intakes, which may promote carcinogenesis or cancer progression. On May, 2015, the NIH National Toxicology Program (NTP) and Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) convened an expert panel to identify research needs related to the safe use of high intakes of folic acid based on consideration of the state of the science. The Cancer Subpanel concluded, “There is consistent enough suggestion in human studies of an adverse effect on cancer growth from supplemental folic acid to justify further research” (NTP Monograph: Identify Research Needs for Assessing Safe Use of High Intakes of Folic Acid. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggested a positive association between serum folate levels and risk of prostate cancer. Circulating unmetabolized folic acid (cUMFA) is a by-product of high intake of folic acid, and has been associated with reduction of cytotoxicity of natural killer cells, which may be a mechanism by which high levels of folic acid promote carcinogenesis. Study has shown that participants with dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 19bpdel/del were at increased risk of having elevated levels of cUMFA, particularly when daily folic acid intake exceeded 500 micrograms. African Americans (AAs) are diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer more often and have more than twice the prostate cancer mortality rates as European Americans (EAs). Two published studies demonstrated that DHFR 19bpdel/del frequency is more prevalent among AAs than EAs, which may partially explain the elevated prostate cancer rates among AAs. Therefore, the hypothesis of this application is that excess folic acid intake, as measured by both diet/supplement intake and plasma cUMFA, will be associated with increased odds of high aggressive prostate cancer, and that this effect will be modified by the DHFR polymorphism. This study capitalizes on a large, previously- conducted, well-characterized, case-only study of approximately equal number of AAs and EAs to examine folate/folic acid intake, biomarkers, genetic polymorphisms and racial differences in prostate cancer aggressiveness. The specific aims are to 1) examine the association between folate/folic acid intake from food and supplements in the year prior to diagnosis and prostate cancer aggressiveness in EAs and AAs, 2) evaluate whether there is significant difference in the prevalence of DHFR 19bpdel/del polymorphism between AA and EA; and whether levels of cUMFA are predicted by total intake of folic acid modulated by the DHFR polymorphism, and 3) examine the association between plasma folate/cUMFA and prostate cancer aggressiveness in EAs and AAs. The project represents an innovative approach to identify modifiable risk factors and genetic markers to address an important public health issue, and is strengthened by the collaboration of a strong, multidisciplinary team of investigators. Finding of this study, if hypothesis confirmed, will shed light into concerns about the safety of folic acid supplement and to inform dietary guidelines for cancer prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE A growing body of literatures suggests that increased folate intake, in particular in the synthetic form of folic acid, may be associated with unexpected adverse effects, such as cancer, due to inadequate ability to metabolize folic acid into physiologically usable tetrahydrofolate. This application efficiently utilizes existing data and samples from a population-based study of prostate cancer subjects in two southern states to examine the relationship between various forms of folate/folic acid and their relationship with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.

"KAPS Biotech: A novel biomarker to improve prostate cancer diagnosis Abstract Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most common non-skin cancer in men and third most common cause of cancer deaths in men. Black men experience a higher burden of incidence and mortality from CaP compared to White men. The Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test, a commonly used biomarker for early diagnosis and management of CaP, cannot alone accurately predict the presence of CaP, its aggressiveness, or the risk of post-treatment recurrence. The widespread use of PSA testing in CaP screening is controversial partially because patients with benign enlargement of the prostate often have elevated levels of PSA and many men with diagnosed CaP have a normal PSA. Consequently, a search for more effective prostate tumor biomarkers is overdue. KAPS Biotech’s preliminary studies show that concurrent measurements of the levels of serum cytokines such as IL-8, TNF-, and sTNF-R1 (KAPS biomarker) provide a significant advantage as a CaP biomarker over PSA measurements alone in differentiating men with CaP from men without CaP. However, these preliminary studies were carried out on a small sample and essentially contained no Black men. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both Black and White men with CaP have altered circulating levels of KAPS biomarker compared to men without CaP. Further, the extent to which these levels are altered will vary according to CaP risk factors and can be used as a tool to improve the early detection of CaP and CaP treatment decision-making. Due to the reported significant racial differences in the diagnoses of and mortality from CaP, future CaP biomarker studies should include a racially diverse sample of men, especially Black men. Therefore, newly developed biomarkers must be validated in a robust and racially diverse population of men to improve the specificity of CaP diagnosis and to better inform CaP treatment decision making. To test the central hypothesis, this Fast Track proposal proposes the following specific aims: Phase I: A small, one-year prospective proof-of-principle study to determine whether KAPS biomarker (concurrent measurements of IL-8, TNF-, and sTNFR1) can distinguish those with CaP from those without CaP among Black and White men. Phase II: A large, prospective cohort study to address the following aims:  1. Determine whether KAPS biomarker can prospectively distinguish those with CaP from those without  CaP among a large sample of Black and White men.  2. Determine whether KAPS biomarker can prospectively distinguish men with high-risk CaP from those  with indolent CaP among a large sample of Black and White men with CaP. Narrative The Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test is currently the most commonly used prostate cancer biomarker. The PSA test has a 70% false positive and 30% false negative rate, meaning that, each year in the United States, approximately 700,000 men undergo unnecessary prostate biopsies and more than a million men are overtreated for prostate cancer. KAPS biomarker (which measures three relevant biomarkers at the same time) outperforms the PSA test both in detecting prostate cancer and in differentiating between high- and low-risk prostate cancers.",KAPS Biotech: A novel biomarker to improve prostate cancer diagnosis,9621494,R42MD013412,"['Adoption ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Biopsy ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Serologic tests ', ' serology ', ' Serological Tests ', ' Societies ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tumor Markers ', ' tumor specific biomarker ', ' tumor biomarker ', ' TM-MKR ', ' United States ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Family ', ' TNFR ', ' TNF Receptors ', ' TNF Receptor Superfamily ', ' TNF Receptor Family Protein ', ' Cachectin Receptors ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' improved ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Assay ', ' PSA Assay ', ' Prostate specific antigen measurement ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Indolent ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' prostate cancer detection ', ' detect prostate cancer ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' tool ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' prostate enlargement ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' TNF gene ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' TNFα ', ' TNFA ', ' TNF-α ', ' TNF Alpha ', ' TNF A ', ' TNF ', ' Monocyte-Derived TNF ', ' Macrophage-Derived TNF ', ' Cachectin ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' IL8 gene ', ' b-ENAP ', ' TSG-1 ', ' SCYB8 ', ' MONAP ', ' MDNCF ', ' LYNAP ', ' LUCT ', ' K60 ', ' IL8 ', ' IL-8 ', ' GCP1 ', ' CXCL8 ', ' AMCF-I ', ' 3-10C ', ' Address ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' prospective ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' high risk ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' novel marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' prostate biopsy ', ' early detection markers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' cancer markers ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' cancer survival ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' ']",NIMHD,"KAPS BIOTECH, INC.",R42,2018,213600,0.22329798724551772
"Multidiciplinary Integrative Genomic Approach to Distinguish Lethal from Indolent Prostate Cancer in Men of Europena and African Ancestry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are several critical unmet needs in the management of localized prostate cancer. Central among them is the development of minimally invasive tools to distinguish localized cancers that are truly indolent from cancers that are progressive and potentially lethal. To address this key need, we first propose to perform an integrated, multi-dimensional genomic, epigenomic and expression analysis to uncover novel molecular pathways that characterize indolent vs. aggressive prostate cancers. In this approach we define indolent tumors as those screen detected (e.g. PSA screening) lesions that are Gleason score 6 (or less) that are organ confined at radical prostatectomy. We consider these tumors indolent as they do not appear capable of metastasis. In contrast, we equate Gleason score 8-10 tumors as ""interval"" or symptomatic since, even with primary treatment, these tumors often recur and metastasize at high frequencies. Additionally, we will validate our key markers/pathways discovered in this project using additional populations with long term outcomes. We hypothesize that our multi-modality genomic-based integrated approach, contrasting these two divergent tumor types, will reveal signatures that distinguish cancers with dichotomous phenotypes. We also hypothesize that these signatures will vary based on race and thus in parallel we will comprehensively characterize African American prostate cancers to reveal molecular features driving racial disparities in outcomes. We will validate the signatures obtained using large cohorts of cases with established outcomes including: (1) the Johns Hopkins Active surveillance cohort and (2) Prostate cancer cases from the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), an observational cohort of men followed since 1954 with autopsy documented indolent or aggressive/lethal disease. We also propose that these signatures will be able to predict outcomes of cancers with indeterminate kinetics and propose to test this through analysis of cases of intermediate risk prostate cancer with long-term follow-up and known outcomes from Johns Hopkins and in collaboration with colleagues from Harvard, from the Physician's Health and Health Professionals follow-up studies. Together this work will yield highly relevant information that can be directly applied to the clinical management of localized prostate cancer. Specifically, it will yield an integrated signature that distinguishes localized - indolent tumors from localized tumors with lethal potential. Additionally we believe these signatures will be critical in determining treatment strategies for individuals with prostate cancers of indeterminate kinetics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The key unmet need in the management of prostate cancers pivots around the dilemma of the screen detected tumor as clinicians balance over treating cancers that are indolent with delaying/under-treating cancers that are aggressive and pose harm. Nomograms containing clinical and pathologic variables are helpful but additional minimally invasive methods are needed to improve their predictive capabilities. This project, which will comprehensively characterization prostate cancers and their microenvironment from both Caucasian and African American men, will inform unique pathways that modulate these two states and allow the development of novel minimally invasive tools that improve patient care.",Multidiciplinary Integrative Genomic Approach to Distinguish Lethal from Indolent Prostate Cancer in Men

"Modeling to Improve Prostate Cancer Outcomes Across Diverse Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. In the US, 1 in 7 men will experience a prostate cancer diagnosis in his lifetime. Identifying ways to reduce the burden of prostate cancer is therefore a top research priority. Management of prostate cancer has changed dramatically since the advent and widespread dissemination of the PSA test. Since the early 1990s, prostate cancer mortality in the US has dropped by almost half. The CISNET Prostate Working Group (PWG) was formed to use disease modeling to explain these mortality trends. The CISNET PWG has developed three models of prostate cancer natural history, detection, and survival and calibrated them against US prostate cancer trends. Results indicate that both screening and treatment changes have reduced prostate cancer deaths. However, policies must be tailored to limit harms and costs associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Different approaches for doing this have been proposed but cannot all be investigated in prospective studies. The objective of this application is to utilize and extend the CISNET PWG models to identify tailored and targeted intervention strategies that offer the most benefit while limiting harms and costs. We will determine whether we can improve screening further by using novel stratification approaches and also whether we can safely limit harms of overtreatment by judicious choices of primary and secondary therapies. These approaches will be applied in the US population and in international cancer control settings that may require modified strategies. We will provide decision makers with model access via online calculators with graphical user interfaces. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Identify active surveillance strategies that minimize patient burden without increasing risks of progression to non-curable disease or death. Aim 2: Develop stratified approaches to prostate cancer screening that target high-risk men based on polygenic risk and baseline PSA at age 45. Aim 3: Model secondary treatment strategies, their impact, and implications for population prostate cancer control. Aim 4: Determine whether racial disparities in prostate cancer mortality can be reduced by using stratified screening and treatment strategies. Aim 5: Modularize models to evaluate cancer control programs in non-US populations and collaborate with investigators in the UK and the Caribbean to develop policies for their populations and resources. Aim 6: Develop online calculators to support patient-physician decisions and policymaker deliberations about PSA screening and treatment for localized prostate cancer. These aims are highly responsive to the funding opportunity announcement, addressing 6 of the 9 targeted priority areas. Our cumulative expertise in prostate modeling, our existing models, and our close ties with clinical experts who provide access to large, high-quality datasets for model validation and calibration position us well to uniquely contribute to the national and international dialogue about how best to address and control this most common cancer in men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative The most effective ways to prevent, treat, and manage prostate cancer remain uncertain. Our team of investigators uses a unique inter-disciplinary approach for bringing together high-quality data from a wide range of sources and developing unified models of cancer progression to answer the most critical questions. In this application, we will examine efficiency gains of screening only high-risk individuals, benefits of avoiding or delaying treatment for low-risk cancers, and feasible approaches for reducing racial disparities.

"Provider Characteristics and Quality of Prostate Cancer Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Assessment of comparative effectiveness of treatment is essential to achieve optimal quality of care [1-2]. Quality of care in healthcare is a multifaceted issue that involves factors related to patient, provider, health care system, community and environment [1-16]. Disparities exist in the quality of prostate cancer care across geographic regions, hospitals, age and racial and ethnic groups [17-23], including treatment variability among comparable patients [17-19, 24-27]. The objective of our study is to analyze the complex interplay of personal factors, clinical factors, provider factors and their relationship with variation in quality of care and heterogeneity of treatment among men with prostate cancer (localized or advanced). Specific aims are: (1): To assess the contribution of provider (hospital and physician) characteristics in the observed disparities (race/ethnicity and disability status) in process of care (type of treatment, time to treatment and diagnostic procedures), and outcomes (short-term and long-term), among prostate cancer patients; (2) To assess the contribution of patient and provider characteristics in the heterogeneous treatment effects among prostate cancer patients; (3) To assess the contribution of continuity of care to the disparity in quality of care (process of care and outcomes) and the heterogeneous treatment effects among prostate cancer patients. To accomplish these aims, we propose a retrospective cohort control design study using the SEER-Medicare linked data. All African American, Asian, Hispanic, and Caucasian men, diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1995 and 2012 (n=282,487) will be identified and followed retrospectively for one year pre-diagnosis and up to fifteen years post-diagnosis. Physician and hospital characteristics will be determined by linkage to the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Hospital Association (AHA) annual survey, respectively. Our main comparators are various treatments for localized or advanced prostate cancer. We will use multilevel modeling approach. First, we will study the association of hospital characteristics with racial and ethnic disparity in process of care and outcomes. Next, we will analyze the contribution made by physician characteristics to racial and ethnic disparity in process of care and outcomes. Finally, we will investigate the role played by continuity of care in the observed racial and ethnic disparity in process of care and outcomes. We will use propensity score and instrumental variable approaches to minimize measured and unmeasured biases. Our study proposes a novel systems approach for analyzing the complex interplay of provider characteristics and their relationship with racial and ethnic disparities in process of care and outcomes among prostate cancer patients. The study results will aid in development of micro and macro level treatment, care and payment policies to address disparity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Assessment of comparative effectiveness of treatment is essential to achieve optimal quality of care. Quality of care in healthcare is a multifaceted issue that involves factors related to patient, provider, health care system, community and environment. Treatment heterogeneity effect can lead to sub-optimal treatment outcomes and ultimately impair patient's quality of care. The objective of our study is to analyze the complex interplay of personal factors, clinical factors, provider factors and their relationship with variaion in quality of care and heterogeneity of treatment among men with prostate cancer (localized or advanced) using SEER-Medicare, AMA and AHA databases.",Provider Characteristics and Quality of Prostate Cancer Care,9473754,R01HS024106,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,230778,0.30342612778702294
"Is depression associated with prostate cancer progression? PROJECT SUMMARY Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer prevalence and incidence in men worldwide. In the United States, alone, nearly 3 million prevalent cases and approximately 180,000 new cases of prostate cancer are expected to occur in the year 2016. Although many men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, most deaths from prostate cancer occur in men who develop advanced-stage disease. Unfortunately, knowing who will progress to advanced-stage disease remains a significant medical challenge, as risk factors for prostate cancer progression are not well understood. Depression, however, may be one such risk factor. Previous research has shown that depression (1) is highly prevalent among men diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer, (2) may share some of the same proposed biological mechanisms with prostate cancer progression, (3) is associated with behavioral changes that can increase one’s risk for adverse health outcomes and (4) treatment may lessen some of the negative consequences of depression in individuals with cancer, including the possible increased risk of cancer progression. Therefore, the goal of the present investigation is to test the hypothesis that men diagnosed with clinical depression and early-stage prostate cancer are at an increased risk for both biochemical progression and the development of advanced-stage disease and that depression treatment, through antidepressant medication use and/or depression psychotherapy, will mitigate this increased risk. Utilizing electronic health record data, from the nearly 36,000 male-members of the Kaiser Permanente Southern California integrated healthcare system diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer between 2000 and 2014, we will (1) test whether a diagnosis of depression (without depression treatment) is associated with prostate cancer biochemical progression and/or the development of advanced-stage prostate cancer after controlling for identified socio-demographic, health history and clinical characteristic confounders and (2) further evaluate whether (i) antidepressant medication use, (ii) depression psychotherapy and/or (iii) antidepressant medication use with depression psychotherapy (all with and without a depression diagnosis) is associated with prostate cancer biochemical progression and/or the development of advanced-stage prostate cancer after controlling for identified socio-demographic, health history and clinical characteristic confounders. Findings from this investigation could benefit men with early-stage prostate cancer by (1) providing insight into the possible risk of prostate cancer progression in men with comorbid depression, (2) highlighting potential disparities in depression burden by clinical and/or socio-demographic factors, (3) creating evidence to advocate for increased care-coordination within the current healthcare delivery and depression management models, (4) identifying men who could benefit most from increased depression screening or psychosocial intervention leading to tailored future psychosocial interventions and (5) advocating for the conduct of further investigations into the possible relationship between depression and prostate cancer progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE One of the most perplexing questions in prostate cancer care and research is in identifying those men who will progress to advanced-stage prostate cancer. Men with depression, who may experience biological and/or behavioral depression-related changes, might be one group at greater risk for developing biochemical and/or disease-stage prostate cancer progression. Thus, we will test whether men diagnosed with clinical depression and early-stage prostate cancer are at an increased risk for biochemical progression and/or the development of advanced-stage prostate cancer and examine how antidepressant medication use and depression psychotherapy may affect this relationship.",Is depression associated with prostate cancer progression?,9513231,R03CA219447,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' telomere ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' integrated health system ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Genetic ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' psychosocial ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' Depression screen ', ' depression screening ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer care ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Telomere Shortening ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' depression comorbidity ', ' comorbidity with depression ', ' comorbid with depression ', ' comorbid depression ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' prostate cancer progression ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' ']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2018,80000,0.28908162278841804
"Diagnosing clinically-significant prostate cancer in African American men: Systematic random versus MR-image-fusion guided biopsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most localized prostate cancers (PCa) are indolent and will never become aggressive during a patient's lifetime. Many of these patients could benefit from active surveillance (AS), but uncertainty about their individual risk prompts them to choose radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy, which can negatively impact quality of life, with only ~10% of patients in the US electing AS. Among the key barriers that prevent a more widespread adoption of AS is the fact that the current 12-core systematic random prostate needle diagnostic biopsy (SR-Bx) protocol can miss areas of more advanced disease already present in the prostate in ~30% of patients, thus introducing under-staging and under-grading error at the time of diagnosis. This error seems to be higher among African-American (AA) men, who are at a disproportionally higher risk of developing aggressive PCa and of dying of their disease. Specifically, among AA men, existing predictors to determine AS eligibility seem to perform more poorly, the rate of high-grade tumors missed during biopsy is higher, and rates tumor progression while on AS are higher. Therefore, there is an urgent need to test more reliable biopsy approaches to better discriminate men with clinically insignificant disease (CiPCa), who will truly benefit from AS, from those with clinically significant PCa (CSPCa) who require definitive treatment. We have shown that among white men the use of MRI for identifying suspicious lesions and for targeting prostate biopsies to them with MRI-US image-fusion biopsy technique (MRUS-Bx) outperforms SR-Bx in CSPCa detection, cancer core length, cancer rate per core, cancer volume estimation, and detection of anterior cancers (more common among AA men). We now propose to undertake a randomized controlled trial to compare the detection rate of CSPCa between SR-Bx and MRUS-Bx among AA and white men, to provide better clinical tools to discriminate between CSPCa and CiSPCa and thus, in the long term, improve overall survival among AA men. AIM 1: We propose to enroll 400 men (200 AA, 200 white) with elevated PSA (>2.5 ng/mL) and negative digital rectal exam across 5 academic institutions and 1 private practice. Men will be randomized into two arms: 1) SR-Bx (12 cores) with an MRI 3-months after biopsy for men without CSPCa; 2) pre-biopsy MRI with MRUS- Bx (2 cores/lesion) for men MRI visible lesions (PIRADS > 3). We will compare biopsy detection rate of CSPCa and CiSPCa. AIM 2: we will validate among men who elect RP (~110 in the RCT) the accuracy of MRUS-Bx based on the agreement with findings from step-sectioned RP specimens. AIM 3: we will identify among men invited to participate and those enrolled in the RCT, determinants of a) study participation and b) treatment decision (AS vs radiation vs RP), and c) compare morbidity associated with either SR-Bx vs MRUS-Bx. The results of our study may change the standard of care and improve accuracy in the diagnosis of PCa among asymptomatic men, which will increase confidence in making the correct treatment decision (definitive treatment versus active surveillance), particularly AA men with PCa who are at the greatest disadvantage. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will validate a novel protocol for the diagnosis of prostate cancer among asymptomatic men that has the potential to reduce over-diagnosis and increase the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. This approach promises to be especially relevant for African-American men who are at the highest risk of getting prostate cancer, have higher rates of under-diagnosis of aggressive disease, and thus limited eligibility for active surveillance. Therefore, the results of this study have the potentia to change the standard of practice for diagnosis of localized PCA, reduce overtreatment, and reduce disparities in cancer detection and management among African-Americans.",Diagnosing clinically-significant prostate cancer in African American men: Systematic random versus MR-image-fusion guided biopsy,9566118,R01CA205058,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Goals ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Needles ', ' Patients ', ' Private Practice ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' rectal ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Lesion ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Indolent ', ' Individual ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' success ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Reporting ', ' Radiation ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Length ', ' Detection ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Clinical Management ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' prostate biopsy ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,340175,0.17208307638421996
"Epigenomic and transcriptomic markers of aggressive prostate cancer among African American men PROJECT SUMMARY  African American men experience a disproportionate burden of aggressive prostate cancer and prostate cancer mortality when compared with white men. The underlying reason for the disparity is unclear and the ability to predict an individual patient's disease trajectory remains limited. This makes treatment decisions difficult, particularly as available treatments range widely from active surveillance to radical prostatectomy, which can have severe consequences such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. There is growing evidence to support the potential of DNA methylation (DNAm) and RNA expression markers in prostate tumors to enhance prostate cancer prognostication beyond clinical factors, but few studies to date have focused on African American men.  The present pilot study will leverage a unique patient population (>40% African American) and archival radical prostatectomy prostate tissue from the University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center. Aims 1 and 2 propose to leverage array-based technology to investigate whether DNAm and RNA expression markers can discriminate between aggressive (total Gleason score>7) and non-aggressive prostate cancer (total Gleason<7) in African American men. We will use Gleason score as our endpoint because it is available for all samples and because recent studies have supported its utility as an intermediate endpoint in the discovery of prognostic markers. Aim 3 proposes integrated analyses of DNAm and RNA expression data to investigate the hypothesis that some DNAm markers are associated with aggressive disease independently of expression, thereby providing unique prognostic information.  The K07 mechanism will allow me to receive essential training in the integration/application of tumor tissue biomarkers in epidemiological studies and analysis of high-dimensional data under the guidance of a strong team of mentors with synergistic expertise in molecular epidemiology, prostate tumor biomarkers, bioinformatics/computational genomics, and statistics (Drs. Joanne Dorgan, Lorelei Mucci, Héctor Corrada Bravo and SØren Bentzen). Dr. Arif Hussain, a genitourinary oncologist and basic science researcher in prostate cancer, will serve as an additional advisor and contribute to the interpretation and assessment of clinical significance of findings. My previous research has focused on blood-based biomarkers in targeted genomic regions and I will greatly benefit from specialized training in tumor tissue markers and expanding to high-dimensional data as I move towards independence in molecular cancer epidemiology. Moreover, this study will provide preliminary data that will build toward a larger (R01) application in which I will integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data for the discovery of novel biomarkers of aggressive prostate cancer among African American men. My long-term goal is to lead studies that will promote improved public health and reduce disparities in cancer outcomes through personalized medicine. Project narrative: The overall public health objective of this proposed study is to identify biomarkers that will improve risk- stratification for African American men with prostate cancer, who bear a disproportionate burden of aggressive disease and prostate cancer mortality, but have been underrepresented in previous studies.

"Chemical markers of heterocyclic aromatic amines for human biomonitoring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and second leading cause of cancer-related death among men in the United States. Identifying risk factors of this disease and developing strategies for prevention are critical. A number of epidemiologic studies have reported an association between frequent consumption of well-done cooked meats, containing the heterocyclic aromatic amine (HAA) 2-amino-1-methyl- 6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and prostate cancer risk. PhIP is a potent rodent prostate carcinogen, and it induces oxidative stress, atrophy of the acini, and inflammation of the prostate. These are critical features that occur in human prostate carcinogenesis. A paradigm has been put forth for a causal role of consumption of well-done cooked meats containing PhIP (and other HAAs) in the etiology of prostate cancer; however, biomarkers of exposure and DNA damage are lacking to validate this model.  Our long-term goal is to assess the cancer risk posed by HAAs, by employing chemical markers that may distinguish individuals at different levels of risk. In this grant renewal, our objective is to assess dietary exposure to PhIP and its potential to induce damage to DNA in the prostate in relation to other HAAs, meat genotoxicants, and endogenous electrophiles produced in the cell, by employing mass spectrometric (MS)- based methods to measure genotoxicants and identify their biomarkers of DNA damage in the prostate.  We will implement our recently established biomarkers of HAAs and other cooked meat genotoxicants and their DNA adduction products in cohorts of African American and Caucasian men with benign prostate hyper- plasia or prostate cancer who frequently eat well-done cooked meat. In Aim 1) HAA exposure will be assessed by measurement of HAAs accrued in hair; DNA adducts of HAAs, other meat genotoxicants, and endogenous electrophiles, will be determined by different MS scanning methods, in prostate. In Aim 2) Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded prostate tissue, an underutilized biospecimen in biomonitoring DNA damage, will be employed to screen for HAA-DNA adducts in subjects undergoing prostatectomy. Adduct levels will be compared to those values obtained by current but non-specific immunohistochemical techniques. MS methods will also be implemented to measure PhIP-serum albumin adducts as long-lived biomarkers of the biologically effective dose. In Aim 3) we will conduct high density genotyping of genes encoding enzymes involved carcinogen metabolism that may impact DNA damage in the prostate. Prostate HAA-DNA adduct levels will be correlated to HAA levels in hair; the levels of HAA and other DNA adducts in prostate will be correlated to genotypes of phase I and II xenobiotic metabolism enzymes, which impact biological activity.  Our findings will provide direct measurement of DNA damage and assess the relative contribution of HAAs, other cooked meat genotoxicants and endogenous electrophiles to the genetic damage of DNA in the prostate. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cooking of meat well-done produces heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), which are prostate carcinogens in experimental animals and potential human carcinogens. The quantitative measurement of HAA exposure and identification of mutation-prone DNA adducts of HAAs in the human prostate would strengthen the biological plausibility for a role of HAAs in the etiology of prostate cancer. With these data in hand, educational and primary cancer prevention efforts may be devised because there are methods of cooking meats that do not lead to substantial formation of hazardous HAAs.",Chemical markers of heterocyclic aromatic amines for human biomonitoring,9547774,R01CA122320,"['Animals ', ' Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy ', ' benign prostate hyperplasia ', ' Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carcinogens ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lipid Peroxidation ', ' Meat ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatectomy ', ' Proteins ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Serum Albumin ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' 2-Amino-1-Methyl-6-Phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ', ' PhIP ', ' Measures ', ' Tissue Embedding ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Carcinogen-DNA Adducts ', ' DNA Adducts ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Atrophic ', ' Atrophy ', ' cooking ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Frequencies ', ' human tissue ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' beef ', ' adduct ', ' cancer risk ', ' genotoxicity ', ' diet and cancer ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism Analysis ', ' Polymorphism Detection ', ' carcinogenicity ', ' Modeling ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Acinus organ component ', ' acinus ', ' Formalin ', ' Xenobiotic Metabolism ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Dose ', ' DNA Adduction ', ' DNA Adduct Formation ', ' Data ', ' red meat consumption ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Primary Cancer Prevention ', ' Carcinogen Metabolism ', ' Monitor ', ' feeding ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' volunteer ', ' heterocyclic aromatic amines ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' prostate tumorigenesis ', ' prostate carcinogenesis ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' High Fat Diet ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,424595,0.30361774924327717
"Vitamin D and Prostate Cancer Disparities in African American Men PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the United States and disproportionately affects African Americans (AA) compared to European Americans (EA). AAs are also at an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency since darker skin pigmentation inhibits cutaneous vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D status is inversely associated with PCa aggressiveness and mortality and, therefore, vitamin D deficiency has been hypothesized as a biological contributor to the PCa disparity. Serum concentration of the pre-hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D), is the clinical measure of vitamin D status, however, recent evidence suggests that the relationship between serum and tissue levels of vitamin D is more complex than previously thought. Despite having lower levels of 25D in the serum, AAs have higher levels of the active hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D), in the prostate tissue compared to EAs. AAs also have higher expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Additionally, expression of the vitamin D metabolism enzyme CYP27B1, which converts 25D to 1,25D, positively correlates with percent West African ancestry. Levels of 25D in the prostate also inversely correlate with Megalin expression; Megalin is the extracellular receptor responsible for cellular uptake of 25D bound to its carrier protein, the vitamin D binding protein (DBP). The combination of these observations suggests an evolutionary conserved compensatory response in the prostate of African American men to ensure adequate levels of vitamin D in the prostate.  The goal of the research proposed is to explore the hypothesized mechanism of prostatic vitamin D compensation. This will be accomplished by characterizing differences in vitamin D uptake and metabolism in primary prostate cells derived from AA and EA men. Additionally, the proposal will explore the role of Megalin in the prostate. This is of particular relevance since, in addition to 25D-DBP endocytosis, Megalin also binds sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) to facilitate androgen import. Since cancer of the prostate is androgen driven, this dual role of Megalin could have important implications for PCa initiation and progression. If Megalin does mediate internalization of both vitamin D and testosterone into the prostate it would provide an apparent mechanism of increased intra-prostatic androgen in the setting of vitamin D deficiency and could lead to increased risk of prostate cancer or more aggressive disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prostate cancer and vitamin D deficiency both disproportionately affect African American men. Vitamin D status is traditionally assessed by serum blood draw in the clinic, however, uptake and metabolism of vitamin D in the prostate tissue is largely unknown.

"A Multilevel Intervention to Increase the Participation of African Americans in Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer clinical trials are essential to translating research into tangible benefits for patients, but only a small number of patients enroll in a trial Under-enrollment of minorities is an even greater problem because it limits the generalizability of findings and contributes to treatment disparities. Minority under-enrollment in prostate cancer trials is especially troublesome because of the higher incidence, morbidity, and mortality of this cancer among African American men, as compared to White men. The overall goal of our research is to improve cancer care and reduce racial/ethnic cancer disparities by increasing rates at which African American men with prostate cancer make an informed decision to participate in a trial, based on high-quality communication with their physician. In this application, we propose a theory-based multilevel intervention designed to influence African-American patients' attitudes about physicians and about trials; physicians' attitudes about patients and about trials; and patient-provider clinical interactions in which trials may be discussed. The intervention is designed to improve these outcomes: patient understanding of trials and decisions to participate; physician decisions to discuss and offer trials; patient-physician communication; and ultimately, participation rates among African Americans with prostate cancer. We base the intervention on our prior research showing that patient and physician attitudes and beliefs often result in trials not being discussed during clinic visits, or when trials are discussed, communication is ineffective. These factors are even greater in racially discordant visits, and likely contribute to low trial enrollment among African Americans. We will conduct the proposed research at two NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers that provide care in urban areas. African American and White men will be included to allow comparison of the effects of the intervention by patient race. The intervention has two phases. Phase 1 is a randomized trial in which intervention group patients receive a tool to improve their attitudes about trials and increase their active participation in clinic visits in which trials maybe discussed. Phase 2 is an interrupted time series quasi-experiment in which physicians receive an intervention to improve their attitudes about trials and their communication during discussions of trials with patients. Data will include patient and physician self-reports, video recordings of patient-physician clinic visits, and medical records. We propose three Specific Aims: 1) determine the independent and combined effects of each phase of the intervention on outcomes; 2) compare the effects of the intervention on outcomes for African American versus White men; and 3) examine the extent to which patient-physician communication mediates the relationship between the intervention and outcomes. This research is highly significant and innovative because it tests a new conceptual model focusing on patients, physicians, and clinical interactions, and uses social psychological and communication theory to improve clinical practice. Findings should provide evidence for a practical, exportable intervention to increase trial enrollment among African American men with prostate cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinical trials are necessary to make progress in preventing and treating prostate and other cancers. Clinical trials to benefit a large, diverse community, members of majority and minority populations must participate, but minorities are underrepresented.

"Disparities in care of prostate cancer survivors, a population-based cohort study ABSTRACT The burden of prostate cancer (PCa) is substantial, and racial disparities in PCa are the largest in all of oncology. Disparities in PCa screening, diagnosis and treatment have been well-documented; however, while PCa is often slow-growing and patients face a long journey after diagnosis, prior disparities research has largely neglected the vast majority of this journey in the 3.3 million PCa survivors in the US. To optimize overall health and survival, PCa survivors need longitudinal, guideline-recommended healthcare during survivorship. The two most common causes of mortality in men with PCa are 1) cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 2) prostate cancer. There is an urgent need to study disparities in survivorship care, and it is likely that disparities in receipt of guideline-recommended care in PCa survivors directly contribute to the known disparities in mortality in this population. The National Academy of Medicine and American Society of Clinical Oncology have both called for more cancer survivorship research, a high-priority but understudied research area. This study breaks new ground in disparities research by examining survivorship care specific to CVD care and PCa monitoring. It leverages a unique, population-based, and diverse cohort of 1,455 PCa survivors enrolled at diagnosis from 2011-2013 and followed longitudinally with yearly surveys and medical records, with an innovative linkage to administrative and claims data from multiple insurance plans and health care systems, allowing unique insight into disparities in survivorship care by race, insurance/system type (Medicare/Medicaid/private/VA/uninsured), and urban/rural residence. This novel, comprehensive dataset with 3 data sources to measure survivorship care (patient report, medical records, claims) will allow the study team to achieve these specific aims: (1) To examine guideline-recommended PCa-specific survivorship care, including monitoring for PCa recurrence by race, insurance type, and patient rurality; (2) To examine guideline- recommended primary and preventive care – emphasizing cardiovascular disease management and prevention – by race, insurance type, and patient rurality; and (3) To examine data source concordance – patient-report vs medical records vs claims – for guideline-recommended survivorship care, to inform the research methodology for future studies in this area. The anticipated outcomes of this study are to provide novel insight regarding disparities in cancer survivorship care that are directly amenable to intervention; and address fundamental methodologic questions in disparities research on cancer survivorship, made possible by this study's unique dataset. All specific aims directly address known current knowledge gaps in this research area. The research team has extensive experience and expertise with cancer disparities research, analysis of large datasets (including cancer registry and claims data), and designing interventions to reduce disparities and improve the healthcare and overall health of cancer survivors. We will leverage this expertise and findings from this study to design and test interventions targeting disparities in survivorship care as the next step. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT This study addresses a major public health problem –racial disparities in prostate cancer mortality– through a novel examination of the healthcare received by survivors specifically related to the two most common causes of mortality in this patient population: cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer. With 3.3 million prostate cancer survivors in the US, and the high prevalence, morbidity and mortality burden from prostate cancer and cardiovascular disease especially affecting racial minority and rural patients, this study will reveal novel potential targets for intervention to reduce disparities and improve the health and survival of cancer survivors.","Disparities in care of prostate cancer survivors, a population-based cohort study",9572943,R21MD012465,"['Academy ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' hypercholesterolemia ', ' Hypercholesteremia ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Medical Records ', ' Medicine ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methodological Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"CANCER RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. African- American men are disproportionately impacted by prostate cancer and exhibit the highest incidence and mortality rate in the world. The underlying reasons for significant prostate cancer health disparities in African- American men are not clearly understood and may include both biological and socio-economic factors. The RCMl program has helped Clark Atlanta University (CAU) to establish the Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development (CCRTD), a premier research program in prostate cancer. CCRTD focuses on understanding prostate cancer health disparities and has successfully trained the next generation of minority scientists in the area of prostate cancer and developed a community-based educational and research program focusing on the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. In this RCMl renewal application, we propose to enhance, improve and manage our research programs to increase efficient use of technologies, increase research capacity and competitiveness and expand our network through collaborations and partnerships with researchers, research institutes and community organizations. We propose the following specific aims to achieve our goals: 1) To recruit and support additional scientists to build a competitive basic and translational research center focused on prostate cancer health disparities and 2) To maintain and expand the existing research infrastructure within CCRTD. To achieve the specific aims, we plan to focus on two primary activities: a) Administrative Core Activity and b) Technologies and Resources for Core Laboratories Activity.

"Constructing a Relational Bridge to Achieve High-Quality Prostate Cancer Care for African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prostate cancer (PCa) imposes a disproportionate burden on African American men, who have a 63% higher incidence, are more often diagnosed with aggressive disease, and have more than twice the mortality rate of White men. Among the causes of excess mortality is failure to receive definitive treatment (e.g., surgery and radiation) when it would be most beneficial (under-treatment). In addition, over-treatment of low-risk disease (therapies that may not be beneficial yet have serious side effects) contributes to disparities in quality of life, as African American men report more treatment-related side effects that translate to lower quality of life. All of these disparities are most pronounced among low income African American men, many of whom have low health literacy, and receive treatment in low resource settings (e.g., public hospitals and other safety net systems), underscoring the need for targeted research in this setting. PCa treatment options present daunting communication challenges even for high literacy patients, as there are complex trade-offs between survival and quality of life that are very personal. To mitigate this perfect storm of complex treatment options and constraints in communication, we will construct a relational bridge between low income African American men and equal PCa treatment by anchoring the evidence-based intervention of peer navigation in the relational concept of African American brotherhood as a means to foster trust and empowerment, and thus to optimize patient-centered communication and quality of care. Our specific aims are to: (1) develop a multi-dimensional understanding of current PCa care and treatment decision processes among African American safety net patients; (2) adapt an existing peer navigation intervention to empower African American PCa patients as partners in high quality patient-centered PCa care; and (3) pilot test the adapted peer navigation protocol for feasibility and acceptability, and for impact on patient centeredness and treatment chosen. This K01 project will have significant impact by directly targeting multiple elements of PCa treatment quality in a single integrated approach. The candidate, Nynikka Palmer, DrPH, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in General Internal Medicine at San Francisco General Hospital, University of California, San Francisco with secondary appointments in the Departments of Urology and Radiation Oncology. With support from an exceptional mentoring team, and execution of interconnected training and research activities, Dr. Palmer will carry out formal coursework, independent mentored learning, and experiential learning that converge around three key topics: (1) depth in cultural understanding and methods via ethnography, (2) patient-centered health communication intervention development and implementation, and (3) design and conduct of randomized controlled trials. This K01 project will facilitate Dr. Palmer's long-term career goal to become an independent investigator who develops, implements, and disseminates culturally meaningful interventions to improve the quality of cancer care and reduce the burden of PCa among African American men. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American men bear an excess burden of prostate cancer that can be attributed in part to disparities in optimal treatment, which are exacerbated by low levels of health literacy among patients treated in low resource settings where time constraints and communication barriers degrade quality of care. The goal of the proposed training and research is to address these barriers by bridging the divide between low-income African American men and equal prostate cancer treatment with the evidence-based intervention of peer navigation adapted through the relational concept of African American brotherhood as a means to foster trust and empowerment, and thus to optimize patient-centered communication and quality of care.",Constructing a Relational Bridge to Achieve High-Quality Prostate Cancer Care for African Americans,9543386,K01CA211965,"['Appointment ', ' Awareness ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Impotence ', ' impotent ', ' Incidence ', ' Incontinence ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' literacy ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Urology ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Caring ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Survivors ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Research Activity ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' treatment planning ', ' Familiarity ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Radiation ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' active method ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prostate cancer treatment ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', ' safety net ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' PSA test ', ' PSA screening ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' patient engagement ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2018,184680,0.13782088229025793
"Mitochondria in Prostate Cancer Diversity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The androgen receptor (AR) plays an important role in normal development of the prostate gland, in prostate carcinogenesis, and in the progression of prostate cancer to advanced metastatic disease. Traditional thinking is that AR localizes exclusively to the nucleus and that nuclear AR regulates genes that are essential to prostate cancer development. This is true. However, we demonstrate a previously unrecognized function of AR in mitochondria. We have discovered that AR 1) directly localizes into the mitochondria and 2) indirectly transcriptionally regulates nuclear genes whose products localize into mitochondria and perform mitochondrial functions. Our studies reveal that i) AR localizes into mitochondria in primary prostate tissues and cell lines, ii) AR is imported into isolated mitochondria, and iii) AR contains a mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) capable of targeting foreign proteins, such as green fluorescent protein, into mitochondria. Indirectly, AR controls expression of a variety of nuclear DNA (nDNA)-encoded mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mtOXPHOS) subunits, including NDUFB8 (Complex I), SDHB (Complex II), UQCRC2 (Complex III), COXII subunit (Complex IV), and ATP5A (Complex V). AR also down-regulates the TFAM, GFM1, and GFM2 genes, which control mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content. Consistent with this, the mtDNA content and the expression of mtDNA-encoded COX II protein is significantly reduced in PC3-AR prostate cells expressing AR. Notably, we demonstrate that the mtDNA content in prostate tumors of African-Americans (AA) is >6 times less than in tumors of Caucasian-Americans (CA). mtDNA content was also lower in normal prostates of AA than CA. To identify the underlying mitochondrial basis of prostate cancer diversity, we conducted comprehensive, race-based bioinformatics analyses of variants in more than 6000 AA and 33,000 CA and discovered, in the AR gene of AA, missense variants located in two domains: the N-terminal domain containing the MLS and the DNA-binding domain. Of note, missense mutations in CA were found only in the hinge domain containing the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of AR. Expression of AR variant S598G in PC3 cells reduced more than the wild type the expression of TFAM, which controls mtDNA content. We hypothesize that AR missense variants/mutants present, solely in AA, contribute to the ""gain"" or ""loss"" of mitochondrial function and thereby to prostate cancer diversity in AA. AIM 1: Determine the prognostic significance of AR missense variants/mutants and mtDNA content on prostate cancer metastasis and reoccurrence in AA and CA. AIM 2: Evaluate the significance of mitochondrial AR missense variants/mutants as direct regulators of mitochondrial functions that affect composition, organization, stability, and activity of mtOXPHOS super-complexes and apoptosis.

"Genetics of Prostate Cancer in Africa ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most common cancer in men of African descent worldwide. African Americans (AA) suffer from the highest rates of CaP in the world, with an average annual incidence rate of 229 per 100,000 in the period 2006-2010 (SEER). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) GLOBOCAN program estimates that CaP is also the leading cancer in terms of incidence and mortality in men from Africa and the Caribbean. AA men experience the highest rate of aggressive CaP and CaP-specific mortality of any ethnic group in the US. IARC also predicts that CaP deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will almost double from 55,522 in 2010 to 105,758 by 2030 (i.e., more than twice as many deaths as in the US). While men of African descent around the world suffer disproportionately from CaP compared to men of other races or ethnicities, our understanding of the reasons for these disparities remains incomplete. To date, few exposure, lifestyle, or environmental influences have been identified in CaP etiology. In contrast, CaP is among the most heritable of common cancers, and over 90 susceptibility loci have been identified. However, many of these loci have not been replicated in AA, in part because of limited African descent sample sizes, incomplete capture of African alleles, and a limited understanding of African genomic architecture.  To better understand the etiology of CaP in African descent men, we have initiated a large, multicenter consortium known as ""Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate"" (MADCaP). Using resources of this consortium, we propose to undertake a multicenter study of CaP in SSA addressing the following Aims:  Specific Aim 1: Genetic Susceptibility: Discover novel CaP loci and validate known CaP loci in African men to provide new information about the genetic etiology of CaP.  Specific Aim 2. Population Genomics: Evaluate how population differentiation and the recent evolutionary history of African and African American populations inform the underlying reasons for the high rates of CaP in African Americans.  This proposal will identify African alleles influence CaP risk in African populations, and will provide information about the African genome that will be of value to a wide range of genome discovery studies in CaP and other diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer is a significant and under-appreciated public health problem in Africa and represents a critical public health concern in African Americans. We propose to address these concerns by developing a multicenter collaborative structure for prostate cancer research in Africa. Using this infrastructure, we will detect novel African alleles using a genome-wide association approach, evaluate African ancestral genomic relationships and thereby gain knowledge about prostate cancer etiology relevant to men in African and across the African diaspora, including African Americans.",Genetics of Prostate Cancer in Africa,9551971,U01CA184374,"['Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Genome ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Link ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' Prostate carcinoma ', ' carcinoma prostatic cancer ', ' Prostatic carcinoma ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' International Agency for Research on Cancer ', ' IARC ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' public health relevance ', ' infrastructure development ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,U01,2018,2030992,0.26346707882784454
"Circadian Disruption and Risk of Prostate Cancer in a Multiethnic Cohort ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 1.1 million men are diagnosed with prostate cancer globally and causing 300,000 cancer-specific deaths each year. The impact is particularly profound for African-American men who suffer significantly increased mortality rates. The sources of these substantial prostate cancer disparities are unclear. Our application focuses on disruption of circadian rhythms and prostate cancer risk in a racially/ethnically diverse cohort. The rationale is based on the classification of nightshift work as a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a proposed mechanism through circadian disruption. Our preliminary data from cohorts of white men show that several key components of circadian disruption, including low melatonin, increased sleep disruption, and variation in circadian genes, all are linked with with higher risk of advanced prostate cancer. African-American men have altered circadian rhythms and low melatonin compared to men of other races. We propose an integrative molecular epidemiology study of circadian disruption to investigate the association between circadian disruption and prostate cancer risk, and the extent to which circadian disruption explains racial disparities.  The study will be nested among men in the prospective Multiethnic Cohort (MEC), ongoing since 1993 and including Latino, African-American, Hawaiian, Japanese and white men. We will measure pre-diagnostic urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, the primary metabolite of melatonin, among 1,648 prostate cancer cases (N=801 with advanced/fatal disease) diagnosed 2000 to 2014 and 3,296 matched controls. We will use pre-            existing data from genome-wide association studies to investigate genetic variants in circadian genes and known prostate cancer risk loci with 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels. Because obesity impairs circadian rhythm, we will use anthropometric data to explore the extent to which the link between obesity and prostate cancer is driven through altered circadian rhythm. For all analyses, a primary goal is to formally compare and contrast the associations by race/ethnicity.  The hypothesis that disruption of circadian rhythms is a risk factor for prostate cancer is promising, but has been addressed somewhat superficially; there are only sparse data from the few studies of advanced disease and no study has been conducted within a racially/ethnically diverse population. However, the careful investigation of this novel hypothesis in the proposed study could substantially increase our understanding of modifiable risk factors for prostate cancer, especially for aggressive disease, and also specifically identify risk factors that contribute to disparities. The results of this study are highly translational (potentially by alterng melatonin levels and sleep patterns), and could illuminate opportunities for primary and secondary prevention. Moreover, the utilization of a large established cohort with pre-existing genetic data makes this study highly efficient and cost-effective. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our study aims to investigate circadian disruption as a risk factor for prostate cancer in a multiethnic cohort, a study noteworthy since African-American men are more likely to be diagnosed and are twice as likely to die of the disease compared to white men. Using an integrative molecular epidemiological approach, we aim to evaluate the interplay between common variation in circadian related genes, a urinary biomarker of melatonin levels, race/ethnicity and obesity on prostate cancer risk. The goal is to provide epidemiological data that could be translated into primary and secondary prostate cancer prevention, and potentially novel avenues for prostate cancer therapy.",Circadian

"Is depression associated with prostate cancer progression? PROJECT SUMMARY Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer prevalence and incidence in men worldwide. In the United States, alone, nearly 3 million prevalent cases and approximately 180,000 new cases of prostate cancer are expected to occur in the year 2016. Although many men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, most deaths from prostate cancer occur in men who develop advanced-stage disease. Unfortunately, knowing who will progress to advanced-stage disease remains a significant medical challenge, as risk factors for prostate cancer progression are not well understood. Depression, however, may be one such risk factor. Previous research has shown that depression (1) is highly prevalent among men diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer, (2) may share some of the same proposed biological mechanisms with prostate cancer progression, (3) is associated with behavioral changes that can increase one’s risk for adverse health outcomes and (4) treatment may lessen some of the negative consequences of depression in individuals with cancer, including the possible increased risk of cancer progression. Therefore, the goal of the present investigation is to test the hypothesis that men diagnosed with clinical depression and early-stage prostate cancer are at an increased risk for both biochemical progression and the development of advanced-stage disease and that depression treatment, through antidepressant medication use and/or depression psychotherapy, will mitigate this increased risk. Utilizing electronic health record data, from the nearly 36,000 male-members of the Kaiser Permanente Southern California integrated healthcare system diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer between 2000 and 2014, we will (1) test whether a diagnosis of depression (without depression treatment) is associated with prostate cancer biochemical progression and/or the development of advanced-stage prostate cancer after controlling for identified socio-demographic, health history and clinical characteristic confounders and (2) further evaluate whether (i) antidepressant medication use, (ii) depression psychotherapy and/or (iii) antidepressant medication use with depression psychotherapy (all with and without a depression diagnosis) is associated with prostate cancer biochemical progression and/or the development of advanced-stage prostate cancer after controlling for identified socio-demographic, health history and clinical characteristic confounders. Findings from this investigation could benefit men with early-stage prostate cancer by (1) providing insight into the possible risk of prostate cancer progression in men with comorbid depression, (2) highlighting potential disparities in depression burden by clinical and/or socio-demographic factors, (3) creating evidence to advocate for increased care-coordination within the current healthcare delivery and depression management models, (4) identifying men who could benefit most from increased depression screening or psychosocial intervention leading to tailored future psychosocial interventions and (5) advocating for the conduct of further investigations into the possible relationship between depression and prostate cancer progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE One of the most perplexing questions in prostate cancer care and research is in identifying those men who will progress to advanced-stage prostate cancer. Men with depression, who may experience biological and/or behavioral depression-related changes, might be one group at greater risk for developing biochemical and/or disease-stage prostate cancer progression. Thus, we will test whether men diagnosed with clinical depression and early-stage prostate cancer are at an increased risk for biochemical progression and/or the development of advanced-stage prostate cancer and examine how antidepressant medication use and depression psychotherapy may affect this relationship.",Is depression associated with prostate cancer progression?,9688933,R03CA219447,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DNA Injury ', ' DNA Damage ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' telomere ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' integrated health system ', ' Genetic ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' psychosocial ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' Depression screen ', ' depression screening ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer care ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Telomere Shortening ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' comorbid depression ', ' depression comorbidity ', ' comorbidity with depression ', ' comorbid with depression ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' prostate cancer progression ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,80000,0.28908162278841804
"Constructing a Relational Bridge to Achieve High-Quality Prostate Cancer Care for African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prostate cancer (PCa) imposes a disproportionate burden on African American men, who have a 63% higher incidence, are more often diagnosed with aggressive disease, and have more than twice the mortality rate of White men. Among the causes of excess mortality is failure to receive definitive treatment (e.g., surgery and radiation) when it would be most beneficial (under-treatment). In addition, over-treatment of low-risk disease (therapies that may not be beneficial yet have serious side effects) contributes to disparities in quality of life, as African American men report more treatment-related side effects that translate to lower quality of life. All of these disparities are most pronounced among low income African American men, many of whom have low health literacy, and receive treatment in low resource settings (e.g., public hospitals and other safety net systems), underscoring the need for targeted research in this setting. PCa treatment options present daunting communication challenges even for high literacy patients, as there are complex trade-offs between survival and quality of life that are very personal. To mitigate this perfect storm of complex treatment options and constraints in communication, we will construct a relational bridge between low income African American men and equal PCa treatment by anchoring the evidence-based intervention of peer navigation in the relational concept of African American brotherhood as a means to foster trust and empowerment, and thus to optimize patient-centered communication and quality of care. Our specific aims are to: (1) develop a multi-dimensional understanding of current PCa care and treatment decision processes among African American safety net patients; (2) adapt an existing peer navigation intervention to empower African American PCa patients as partners in high quality patient-centered PCa care; and (3) pilot test the adapted peer navigation protocol for feasibility and acceptability, and for impact on patient centeredness and treatment chosen. This K01 project will have significant impact by directly targeting multiple elements of PCa treatment quality in a single integrated approach. The candidate, Nynikka Palmer, DrPH, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in General Internal Medicine at San Francisco General Hospital, University of California, San Francisco with secondary appointments in the Departments of Urology and Radiation Oncology. With support from an exceptional mentoring team, and execution of interconnected training and research activities, Dr. Palmer will carry out formal coursework, independent mentored learning, and experiential learning that converge around three key topics: (1) depth in cultural understanding and methods via ethnography, (2) patient-centered health communication intervention development and implementation, and (3) design and conduct of randomized controlled trials. This K01 project will facilitate Dr. Palmer's long-term career goal to become an independent investigator who develops, implements, and disseminates culturally meaningful interventions to improve the quality of cancer care and reduce the burden of PCa among African American men. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American men bear an excess burden of prostate cancer that can be attributed in part to disparities in optimal treatment, which are exacerbated by low levels of health literacy among patients treated in low resource settings where time constraints and communication barriers degrade quality of care. The goal of the proposed training and research is to address these barriers by bridging the divide between low-income African American men and equal prostate cancer treatment with the evidence-based intervention of peer navigation adapted through the relational concept of African American brotherhood as a means to foster trust and empowerment, and thus to optimize patient-centered communication and quality of care.",Constructing a Relational Bridge to Achieve High-Quality Prostate Cancer Care for African Americans,9753186,K01CA211965,"['Appointment ', ' Awareness ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hearing ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' impotent ', ' Impotence ', ' Incidence ', ' Incontinence ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' literacy ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Physicians ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Urology ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Caring ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Survivors ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Research Activity ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Active Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' uptake ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' treatment planning ', ' Familiarity ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Radiation ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' survive cancer ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' active method ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', ' prostate cancer treatment ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' safety net ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' Evidence based intervention ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' PSA screening ', ' PSA test ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' patient engagement ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2019,184680,0.13782088229025793

"Epigenomic and transcriptomic markers of aggressive prostate cancer among African American men PROJECT SUMMARY  African American men experience a disproportionate burden of aggressive prostate cancer and prostate cancer mortality when compared with white men. The underlying reason for the disparity is unclear and the ability to predict an individual patient's disease trajectory remains limited. This makes treatment decisions difficult, particularly as available treatments range widely from active surveillance to radical prostatectomy, which can have severe consequences such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. There is growing evidence to support the potential of DNA methylation (DNAm) and RNA expression markers in prostate tumors to enhance prostate cancer prognostication beyond clinical factors, but few studies to date have focused on African American men.  The present pilot study will leverage a unique patient population (>40% African American) and archival radical prostatectomy prostate tissue from the University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center. Aims 1 and 2 propose to leverage array-based technology to investigate whether DNAm and RNA expression markers can discriminate between aggressive (total Gleason score>7) and non-aggressive prostate cancer (total Gleason<7) in African American men. We will use Gleason score as our endpoint because it is available for all samples and because recent studies have supported its utility as an intermediate endpoint in the discovery of prognostic markers. Aim 3 proposes integrated analyses of DNAm and RNA expression data to investigate the hypothesis that some DNAm markers are associated with aggressive disease independently of expression, thereby providing unique prognostic information.  The K07 mechanism will allow me to receive essential training in the integration/application of tumor tissue biomarkers in epidemiological studies and analysis of high-dimensional data under the guidance of a strong team of mentors with synergistic expertise in molecular epidemiology, prostate tumor biomarkers, bioinformatics/computational genomics, and statistics (Drs. Joanne Dorgan, Lorelei Mucci, Héctor Corrada Bravo and SØren Bentzen). Dr. Arif Hussain, a genitourinary oncologist and basic science researcher in prostate cancer, will serve as an additional advisor and contribute to the interpretation and assessment of clinical significance of findings. My previous research has focused on blood-based biomarkers in targeted genomic regions and I will greatly benefit from specialized training in tumor tissue markers and expanding to high-dimensional data as I move towards independence in molecular cancer epidemiology. Moreover, this study will provide preliminary data that will build toward a larger (R01) application in which I will integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data for the discovery of novel biomarkers of aggressive prostate cancer among African American men. My long-term goal is to lead studies that will promote improved public health and reduce disparities in cancer outcomes through personalized medicine. Project narrative: The overall public health objective of this proposed study is to identify biomarkers that will improve risk- stratification for African American men with prostate cancer, who bear a disproportionate burden of aggressive disease and prostate cancer mortality, but have been underrepresented in previous studies. This research, in turn, will allow for more personalized treatment/management strategies that have potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce disparities in prostate cancer mortality.",Epigenomic and transcriptomic markers of aggressive prostate cancer among African American men,9741074,K07CA230182,"['Archives ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maryland ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methylation ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' tumor specific biomarker ', ' tumor biomarker ', ' TM-MKR ', ' Tumor Markers ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Urogenital System ', ' Urogenital ', ' Genitourinary ', ' Genitourinary system ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' myc Oncogenes ', ' Avian Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Homolog ', ' MYC gene ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' DNA analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Indolent ', ' Erectile dysfunction ', ' Oncologist ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' microarray technology ', ' microarray analyses ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Academic/Teacher Award ', ' K07 Program ', ' K07 Mechanism ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Epidemiology of Cancer ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' 8q24 ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Molecular ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' epigenomics ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' patient population ', ' treatment strategy ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' epigenome ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' methylation marker ', ' Data Discovery ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' individual patient ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' personalized management ', ' precision management ', ' personalized disease management ', ' personalized clinical management ', ' individualized patient management ', ' individualized management ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' blood-based biomarker ', ' blood-based marker ', ' Risk stratification ', ' high dimensionality ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K07,2019,138104,0.34999015562962754
"Prostate Cancer Health Disparity: Role of PDEF In African American (AA) men prostate cancer is characterized by higher aggressiveness, more extensive metastases, early onset, and increased mortality rates compared to those in Caucasian men. We propose to evaluate role of PDEF (Prostate Derived Ets Factor) and TWIST-1 in PCa health disparity. The studies proposed in this application are driven by our novel observations that there is graded decrease in PDEF levels in prostate cancer cells with increasing aggressive phenotype and in prostate cancer tissue sections of patients. We also observed in multiple clinical data sets that PDEF mRNA expression is decreased in high Gleason grade PCa and in tumor metastasis. Moreover we observed a reciprocal relationship between PDEF and Twist-1 expression in PCa tissues and that PDEF and Twist-1 expression could predict PCa patient survival. In preliminary studies we observed that PDEF expression is decreased in prostate cancer cells from AA men and in cells with aggressive phenotype, and experimental modulation of PDEF expression modulates cell migration and clonogenic activity in part by promoting luminal differentiation. These exciting preliminary data form the basis of our proposed hypothesis: First, that, “ In African American Men PDEF could serve as a functional marker for distinguishing aggressive prostate cancer from an indolent disease.” Second that “PDEF functions as a metastasis suppressor in prostate cancer in part by modulating expression of Twist-1”, and third that “Loss of PDEF can help us stratify PCa patients that might respond to DNA methyl transferase inhibitors”. We propose three aims to test these hypothesis. AIM 1: To establish differences in expression levels of PDEF between grade-matched Prostate Cancer specimens from African American and Caucasian men and correlate these with patient outcomes; AIM 2: To determine the role of PDEF in PCa metastasis and racial disparity using in vivo model systems, and ; *AIM 3: To evaluate if prostate cancers with PDEF loss respond more favorably to combination of ADT (Enzalutamide) and DNA methyl-transferase inhibitors (azacytidine and decitabine) as compared to ATD alone. The proposed studies are innovative as these will enhance understanding of role of PDEF in suppressing prostate cancer metastasis and help us evaluate usefulness of PDEF/Twist-1 in early detection of patients that may harbor aggressive prostate cancer with enhanced metastatic potential. The impact of our study will be on the development of a new method to distinguish aggressive and metastatic phenotype of prostate cancer from an indolent disease, which will particularly benefit AA men, and reduce ethnic disparity in in prostate cancer treatment outcomes. In African American (AA) men prostate cancer is characterized by higher aggressiveness, early onset, more extensive metastases, and increased mortality rates compared to those in Caucasian men. Conventional therapies produce a high rate of cure for patients with localized prostate cancer, but there is no effective treatment for intervention in metastatic prostate cancer. Currently-used prognostic indicators (Digital rectal exam, PSA measurement and Gleason score) do not predict metastases risk accurately. These facts underline the urgent, yet unmet, need for identification and characterization of new targets that can help distinguish between aggressive and metastatic prostate cancer from an indolent disease. Our goal is to address this vital knowledge gap by characterizing the role of Prostate Derived Ets Transcription Factor (PDEF) in PCa aggressiveness, thereby reducing the prostate cancer-related health disparity between African American (AA) and Caucasian men. We propose a novel and unique causative link between PDEF and metastases. Our proposal also details mechanistic experiments that may help to patient stratification and use PDEF expression as a means to stratify patients to demethylating agents. Our studies will pave the way for routine clinical use of PDEF as an independent predictor of metastases risk.  ",Prostate Cancer Health Disparity: Role of PDEF,9824698,R01CA242839,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Azacitidine ', ' ladakamycin ', ' Azacytidine ', ' AZC ', ' 5-Azacytidine ', ' 5-Aza-cytidine ', ' 5-AC ', ' 5 AZC ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Mission ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"A Multilevel Intervention to Increase the Participation of African Americans in Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer clinical trials are essential to translating research into tangible benefits for patients, but only a small number of patients enroll in a trial Under-enrollment of minorities is an even greater problem because it limits the generalizability of findings and contributes to treatment disparities. Minority under-enrollment in prostate cancer trials is especially troublesome because of the higher incidence, morbidity, and mortality of this cancer among African American men, as compared to White men. The overall goal of our research is to improve cancer care and reduce racial/ethnic cancer disparities by increasing rates at which African American men with prostate cancer make an informed decision to participate in a trial, based on high-quality communication with their physician. In this application, we propose a theory-based multilevel intervention designed to influence African-American patients' attitudes about physicians and about trials; physicians' attitudes about patients and about trials; and patient-provider clinical interactions in which trials may be discussed. The intervention is designed to improve these outcomes: patient understanding of trials and decisions to participate; physician decisions to discuss and offer trials; patient-physician communication; and ultimately, participation rates among African Americans with prostate cancer. We base the intervention on our prior research showing that patient and physician attitudes and beliefs often result in trials not being discussed during clinic visits, or when trials are discussed, communication is ineffective. These factors are even greater in racially discordant visits, and likely contribute to low trial enrollment among African Americans. We will conduct the proposed research at two NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers that provide care in urban areas. African American and White men will be included to allow comparison of the effects of the intervention by patient race. The intervention has two phases. Phase 1 is a randomized trial in which intervention group patients receive a tool to improve their attitudes about trials and increase their active participation in clinic visits in which trials maybe discussed. Phase 2 is an interrupted time series quasi-experiment in which physicians receive an intervention to improve their attitudes about trials and their communication during discussions of trials with patients. Data will include patient and physician self-reports, video recordings of patient-physician clinic visits, and medical records. We propose three Specific Aims: 1) determine the independent and combined effects of each phase of the intervention on outcomes; 2) compare the effects of the intervention on outcomes for African American versus White men; and 3) examine the extent to which patient-physician communication mediates the relationship between the intervention and outcomes. This research is highly significant and innovative because it tests a new conceptual model focusing on patients, physicians, and clinical interactions, and uses social psychological and communication theory to improve clinical practice. Findings should provide evidence for a practical, exportable intervention to increase trial enrollment among African American men with prostate cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinical trials are necessary to make progress in preventing and treating prostate and other cancers. Clinical trials to benefit a large, diverse community, members of majority and minority populations must participate, but minorities are underrepresented.

"Genetic factors for race related prostate cancer. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major problem or barrier is that there are currently no methods or approaches to adequately address prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans. A major question is why do African American men have a higher overall incidence, earlier age of onset, increased proportion of clinically advanced disease and increased bone metastases and mortality from prostate cancer compared to Caucasians? The main goal of this project is to investigate the genetic basis of prostate cancer health disparities The rationale is that prostate cancer is the leading cancer among men of African descent in the USA. Despite more aggressive screening of prostate cancer across all demographics in the United States, disparities among populations persist. A substantial proportion of African American men have a higher overall incidence, earlier age of onset, increased proportion of clinically advanced disease and increased bone metastases and mortality from prostate cancer compared to Caucasians. There are racial disparities in survival after diagnosis of prostate cancer in men. Therefore, prostate cancer incidence and mortality represent a significant public health problem in African American men. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs are significantly altered in prostate cancer. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the differential expression profile of a set of oncogenic miRNAs and tumor suppressor miRNAs in African Americans may target a set of prostate cancer specific genes and may contribute to the prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans. The molecular mechanisms of action of tumor suppressor miRNAs are through repressing oncogenes and activating tumor suppressor genes. We will test these hypotheses through analyses of a series of experiments proposed under our specific aims. All the aims are highly focused, centralized, innovative, clinically significant, functional and mechanistic in nature. Specific Aim # 1. Investigate the role of miRNAs as the genetic basis of prostate cancer health disparity in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. Specific Aim # 2. Investigate the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of action of oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs in race-related prostate cancer. Specific Aim # 3. Investigate the molecular mechanisms of differential expression of miRNAs in African Americans and Caucasians. Impact: The present application has high impact because it describes a novel concept and approach that is different and better from the previous attempts since differential expression of a set of miRNAs may explain why African Americans have higher incidence of prostate cancer compared to Caucasians. This project will identify novel miRNAs that can be used as genetic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for race-related prostate cancer.

"Genetics of Prostate Cancer in Africa ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most common cancer in men of African descent worldwide. African Americans (AA) suffer from the highest rates of CaP in the world, with an average annual incidence rate of 229 per 100,000 in the period 2006-2010 (SEER). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) GLOBOCAN program estimates that CaP is also the leading cancer in terms of incidence and mortality in men from Africa and the Caribbean. AA men experience the highest rate of aggressive CaP and CaP-specific mortality of any ethnic group in the US. IARC also predicts that CaP deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will almost double from 55,522 in 2010 to 105,758 by 2030 (i.e., more than twice as many deaths as in the US). While men of African descent around the world suffer disproportionately from CaP compared to men of other races or ethnicities, our understanding of the reasons for these disparities remains incomplete. To date, few exposure, lifestyle, or environmental influences have been identified in CaP etiology. In contrast, CaP is among the most heritable of common cancers, and over 90 susceptibility loci have been identified. However, many of these loci have not been replicated in AA, in part because of limited African descent sample sizes, incomplete capture of African alleles, and a limited understanding of African genomic architecture.  To better understand the etiology of CaP in African descent men, we have initiated a large, multicenter consortium known as ""Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate"" (MADCaP). Using resources of this consortium, we propose to undertake a multicenter study of CaP in SSA addressing the following Aims:  Specific Aim 1: Genetic Susceptibility: Discover novel CaP loci and validate known CaP loci in African men to provide new information about the genetic etiology of CaP.  Specific Aim 2. Population Genomics: Evaluate how population differentiation and the recent evolutionary history of African and African American populations inform the underlying reasons for the high rates of CaP in African Americans.  This proposal will identify African alleles influence CaP risk in African populations, and will provide information about the African genome that will be of value to a wide range of genome discovery studies in CaP and other diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer is a significant and under-appreciated public health problem in Africa and represents a critical public health concern in African Americans. We propose to address these concerns by developing a multicenter collaborative structure for prostate cancer research in Africa.

"Modulation of host intrinsic immunity to reduce prostate cancer disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer health disparities represent a major public health concern in the United States. Even when socioeconomic factors are accounted for, minority populations have higher overall incidence rates and worse outcomes than the overall population. Prostate cancer is one such disease with higher incidence and death rates in African American (AA) men than Caucasians. Although socioeconomic factors may be blamed to a certain extent, it is appreciated that the genetic composition makes AA men more susceptible to aggressive prostate cancer. Genetic and epigenetic changes are known as tumorigenic drivers because epigenetic editing precludes mounting of host antitumor response necessary for tumor cell clearance. DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), is the best-characterized epigenetic modification in prostate cancer, and racial disparities in DNA methylation are associated with cancer prognosis and survival. Therefore, targeting of DNMT to reverse epigenetic alterations is an appealing therapeutic target, and vital to reduce the observed prostate cancer outcome gaps among AA men and Caucasians. The deoxycytidine analogue decitabine is unique in that it can be repositioned for non-cytotoxic depletion of DNMT. We characterized a low dose of decitabine with its increased absorption in the presence of tetrahydrouridine (THU). Combination of THU with decitabine changes its pharmacology, and facilitates non-cytotoxic DNMT1 depletion. We demonstrated that the THU-decitabine combination significantly inhibits the growth of TRAMP-C2 prostate tumors in immune competent mice, and the addition of CpG immunotherapy further enhanced antitumor immunity. Based on our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that THU-decitabine directed epigenetic therapy revitalize the host intrinsic immunity and augment vaccine-induced antitumor response. Since DNA methylation is prevalent and relates to greater risk in AAs, DNMT depletion will invigorate the immune response of tumor-bearing host, providing an opportunity to immunotherapy inducing robust antitumor immunity. We will test the combination of THU-decitabine directed DNMT depletion, immune modulation and therapeutic vaccine to determine 1) the effect of epigenetic editing on prostate cancer cell growth in murine models; and 2) the effector mechanism of THU-decitabine guided vaccine- induced antigen-specific antitumor immunity in complete regression of early and advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. This project is novel because the concept of a non-toxic THU-decitabine combination with immunotherapy has not been tested in any cancer type. This combinatorial approach will significantly attenuate the growth of aggressive prostate cancer as often presented in AA men, and may represent a novel treatment to reduce prostate cancer disparity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer is the second highest cause of cancer related deaths for men in the United States. However, the unfortunate fact is that the African American men are disproportionally affected by prostate cancer with considerably high incidence and as much as twice the mortality rate than Caucasians. Determining the significance of the host immunity reconstitution following combination approaches of epigenetics editing and immunotherapy in race based prostate cancer is the major goal of this study. If our efficacy aims are achieved, the excellent safety profile of our non-cytotoxic regimen conducive to translate to humans is very promising aimed to reduce prostate cancer disparity.",Modulation

"Genetics of Prostate Cancer in Africa ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most common cancer in men of African descent worldwide. African Americans (AA) suffer from the highest rates of CaP in the world, with an average annual incidence rate of 229 per 100,000 in the period 2006-2010 (SEER). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) GLOBOCAN program estimates that CaP is also the leading cancer in terms of incidence and mortality in men from Africa and the Caribbean. AA men experience the highest rate of aggressive CaP and CaP-specific mortality of any ethnic group in the US. IARC also predicts that CaP deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will almost double from 55,522 in 2010 to 105,758 by 2030 (i.e., more than twice as many deaths as in the US). While men of African descent around the world suffer disproportionately from CaP compared to men of other races or ethnicities, our understanding of the reasons for these disparities remains incomplete. To date, few exposure, lifestyle, or environmental influences have been identified in CaP etiology. In contrast, CaP is among the most heritable of common cancers, and over 90 susceptibility loci have been identified. However, many of these loci have not been replicated in AA, in part because of limited African descent sample sizes, incomplete capture of African alleles, and a limited understanding of African genomic architecture.  To better understand the etiology of CaP in African descent men, we have initiated a large, multicenter consortium known as ""Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate"" (MADCaP). Using resources of this consortium, we propose to undertake a multicenter study of CaP in SSA addressing the following Aims:  Specific Aim 1: Genetic Susceptibility: Discover novel CaP loci and validate known CaP loci in African men to provide new information about the genetic etiology of CaP.  Specific Aim 2. Population Genomics: Evaluate how population differentiation and the recent evolutionary history of African and African American populations inform the underlying reasons for the high rates of CaP in African Americans.  This proposal will identify African alleles influence CaP risk in African populations, and will provide information about the African genome that will be of value to a wide range of genome discovery studies in CaP and other diseases.

"Diagnosing clinically-significant prostate cancer in African American men: Systematic random versus MR-image-fusion guided biopsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most localized prostate cancers (PCa) are indolent and will never become aggressive during a patient's lifetime. Many of these patients could benefit from active surveillance (AS), but uncertainty about their individual risk prompts them to choose radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy, which can negatively impact quality of life, with only ~10% of patients in the US electing AS. Among the key barriers that prevent a more widespread adoption of AS is the fact that the current 12-core systematic random prostate needle diagnostic biopsy (SR-Bx) protocol can miss areas of more advanced disease already present in the prostate in ~30% of patients, thus introducing under-staging and under-grading error at the time of diagnosis. This error seems to be higher among African-American (AA) men, who are at a disproportionally higher risk of developing aggressive PCa and of dying of their disease. Specifically, among AA men, existing predictors to determine AS eligibility seem to perform more poorly, the rate of high-grade tumors missed during biopsy is higher, and rates tumor progression while on AS are higher. Therefore, there is an urgent need to test more reliable biopsy approaches to better discriminate men with clinically insignificant disease (CiPCa), who will truly benefit from AS, from those with clinically significant PCa (CSPCa) who require definitive treatment. We have shown that among white men the use of MRI for identifying suspicious lesions and for targeting prostate biopsies to them with MRI-US image-fusion biopsy technique (MRUS-Bx) outperforms SR-Bx in CSPCa detection, cancer core length, cancer rate per core, cancer volume estimation, and detection of anterior cancers (more common among AA men). We now propose to undertake a randomized controlled trial to compare the detection rate of CSPCa between SR-Bx and MRUS-Bx among AA and white men, to provide better clinical tools to discriminate between CSPCa and CiSPCa and thus, in the long term, improve overall survival among AA men. AIM 1: We propose to enroll 400 men (200 AA, 200 white) with elevated PSA (>2.5 ng/mL) and negative digital rectal exam across 5 academic institutions and 1 private practice. Men will be randomized into two arms: 1) SR-Bx (12 cores) with an MRI 3-months after biopsy for men without CSPCa; 2) pre-biopsy MRI with MRUS- Bx (2 cores/lesion) for men MRI visible lesions (PIRADS > 3). We will compare biopsy detection rate of CSPCa and CiSPCa. AIM 2: we will validate among men who elect RP (~110 in the RCT) the accuracy of MRUS-Bx based on the agreement with findings from step-sectioned RP specimens. AIM 3: we will identify among men invited to participate and those enrolled in the RCT, determinants of a) study participation and b) treatment decision (AS vs radiation vs RP), and c) compare morbidity associated with either SR-Bx vs MRUS-Bx. The results of our study may change the standard of care and improve accuracy in the diagnosis of PCa among asymptomatic men, which will increase confidence in making the correct treatment decision (definitive treatment versus active surveillance), particularly AA men with PCa who are at the greatest disadvantage. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will validate a novel protocol for the diagnosis of prostate cancer among asymptomatic men that has the potential to reduce over-diagnosis and increase the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. This approach promises to be especially relevant for African-American men who are at the highest risk of getting prostate cancer, have higher rates of under-diagnosis of aggressive disease, and thus limited eligibility for active surveillance. Therefore, the results of this study have the potentia to change the standard of practice for diagnosis of localized PCA, reduce overtreatment, and reduce disparities in cancer detection and management among African-Americans.",Diagnosing clinically-significant prostate cancer in African American men: Systematic random versus MR-image-fusion guided biopsy,9788289,R01CA205058,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Goals ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Needles ', ' Patients ', ' Private Practice ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' improved ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' rectal ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Lesion ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Indolent ', ' Individual ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' success ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Reporting ', ' Radiation ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Length ', ' Detection ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' digital ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' prostate biopsy ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,657431,0.17208307638421996
"Multidiciplinary Integrative Genomic Approach to Distinguish Lethal from Indolent Prostate Cancer in Men of Europena and African Ancestry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are several critical unmet needs in the management of localized prostate cancer. Central among them is the development of minimally invasive tools to distinguish localized cancers that are truly indolent from cancers that are progressive and potentially lethal. To address this key need, we first propose to perform an integrated, multi-dimensional genomic, epigenomic and expression analysis to uncover novel molecular pathways that characterize indolent vs. aggressive prostate cancers. In this approach we define indolent tumors as those screen detected (e.g. PSA screening) lesions that are Gleason score 6 (or less) that are organ confined at radical prostatectomy. We consider these tumors indolent as they do not appear capable of metastasis. In contrast, we equate Gleason score 8-10 tumors as ""interval"" or symptomatic since, even with primary treatment, these tumors often recur and metastasize at high frequencies. Additionally, we will validate our key markers/pathways discovered in this project using additional populations with long term outcomes. We hypothesize that our multi-modality genomic-based integrated approach, contrasting these two divergent tumor types, will reveal signatures that distinguish cancers with dichotomous phenotypes. We also hypothesize that these signatures will vary based on race and thus in parallel we will comprehensively characterize African American prostate cancers to reveal molecular features driving racial disparities in outcomes. We will validate the signatures obtained using large cohorts of cases with established outcomes including: (1) the Johns Hopkins Active surveillance cohort and (2) Prostate cancer cases from the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), an observational cohort of men followed since 1954 with autopsy documented indolent or aggressive/lethal disease. We also propose that these signatures will be able to predict outcomes of cancers with indeterminate kinetics and propose to test this through analysis of cases of intermediate risk prostate cancer with long-term follow-up and known outcomes from Johns Hopkins and in collaboration with colleagues from Harvard, from the Physician's Health and Health Professionals follow-up studies. Together this work will yield highly relevant information that can be directly applied to the clinical management of localized prostate cancer. Specifically, it will yield an integrated signature that distinguishes localized - indolent tumors from localized tumors with lethal potential. Additionally we believe these signatures will be critical in determining treatment strategies for individuals with prostate cancers of indeterminate kinetics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The key unmet need in the management of prostate cancers pivots around the dilemma of the screen detected tumor as clinicians balance over treating cancers that are indolent with delaying/under-treating cancers that are aggressive and pose harm. Nomograms containing clinical and pathologic variables are helpful but additional minimally invasive methods are needed to improve their predictive capabilities. This project, which will comprehensively characterization prostate cancers and their microenvironment from both Caucasian and African American men, will inform unique pathways that modulate these two

"Molecular tumor subtypes and prostate cancer disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT African American men (AAM) disproportionately experience the burden of prostate cancer with a mortality rate approximately 2.4-fold greater than that observed among white U.S. men. This represents the single largest known cancer disparity by race in the U.S., and it may reflect both biologic heterogeneity in the cancers that arise in AAM, as well as differences in socioeconomic factors that influence healthcare utilization. The relative contribution of sociocontextual and biologic factors to prostate cancer disparities remains unclear. Prostate cancers are phenotypically and molecularly heterogeneous. A better understanding of tumor subtypes by race may aid in the understanding of disease etiology and disparities. The identification of intrinsic subtypes in other cancers, such as breast cancer, has had profound implications for our understanding of the underlying biology and clinical management of those cancers. We will leverage transcriptomic and clinical data from the Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate Network and GenomeDx Decipher Genomic Resource Information Database™ to investigate molecular tumor subtypes with respect to prostate cancer disparities. We hypothesize that the clinical management of prostate cancer can be further optimized for AAM if we can improve the understanding of tumor heterogeneity. To evaluate race- specific differences in tumor molecular prostate cancer subtypes, we propose the following. First, we will characterize the PAM50 subtypes prostate cancer in AAM and white men with prostate cancer. We will evaluate the distribution of PAM50 subtypes by self-identified race/ethnicity (SIRE), their associations with established prognostic factors, and whether they predict differential prognosis by SIRE. Second, we will derive novel molecular subtypes for prostate cancer in AAM. To that end, we will perform consensus clustering analysis to identify and validate molecular subtypes in AAM, develop a gene set predictor of AA prostate cancer subtypes, and assess whether the novel subtypes are differentially associated with prognostic markers or predict differential prognosis by SIRE. Finally, we propose to apply causal mediation analysis to determine the extent to which observed disparities in prostate cancer outcomes can be attributed to differences in subtype prevalence and other prognostic factors by SIRE. These research aims are supported by a comprehensive training plan tailored to my training goals: developing an applied knowledge of advanced concepts in prostate cancer biology, epidemiology, and disparities, and developing a bioinformatic and computational biology skillset. With the support of my Sponsor and Advisory Panel and the rich training environment of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, this award will help facilitate my transition to research independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer among U.S. men, leading to nearly 30,000 estimated deaths annually. African American men disproportionately experience the burden of prostate cancer with a mortality rate approximately 2.4-fold greater than that observed among white U.S. men – the single largest disparity in cancer outcomes by race/ethnicity in the U.S. Prostate cancers are phenotypically and molecularly heterogeneous, and a better understanding of tumor subtypes by race may improve our understanding of disease etiology and disparities, and inform novel approaches for risk stratification or treatment.",Molecular tumor subtypes and prostate cancer disparities,9834319,F32CA243285,"['Award ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biology ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mortality ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' African ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Computational Biology ', ' computer biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Severities ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Prostate carcinoma ', ' carcinoma prostatic cancer ', ' Prostatic carcinoma ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' DF/HCC ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Tumor Subtype ', ' Molecular ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic power ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' biological heterogeneity ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' molecular subsets ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' expression subtypes ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' androgen deprivation therapy ', ' androgen deprivation treatment ', ' androgen ablation therapy ', ' Risk stratification ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,F32,2019,40236,0.4274040392701836
"Circadian Disruption and Risk of Prostate Cancer in a Multiethnic Cohort ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 1.1 million men are diagnosed with prostate cancer globally and causing 300,000 cancer-specific deaths each year. The impact is particularly profound for African-American men who suffer significantly increased mortality rates. The sources of these substantial prostate cancer disparities are unclear. Our application focuses on disruption of circadian rhythms and prostate cancer risk in a racially/ethnically diverse cohort. The rationale is based on the classification of nightshift work as a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a proposed mechanism through circadian disruption. Our preliminary data from cohorts of white men show that several key components of circadian disruption, including low melatonin, increased sleep disruption, and variation in circadian genes, all are linked with with higher risk of advanced prostate cancer. African-American men have altered circadian rhythms and low melatonin compared to men of other races. We propose an integrative molecular epidemiology study of circadian disruption to investigate the association between circadian disruption and prostate cancer risk, and the extent to which circadian disruption explains racial disparities.  The study will be nested among men in the prospective Multiethnic Cohort (MEC), ongoing since 1993 and including Latino, African-American, Hawaiian, Japanese and white men. We will measure pre-diagnostic urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, the primary metabolite of melatonin, among 1,648 prostate cancer cases (N=801 with advanced/fatal disease) diagnosed 2000 to 2014 and 3,296 matched controls. We will use pre-            existing data from genome-wide association studies to investigate genetic variants in circadian genes and known prostate cancer risk loci with 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels. Because obesity impairs circadian rhythm, we will use anthropometric data to explore the extent to which the link between obesity and prostate cancer is driven through altered circadian rhythm. For all analyses, a primary goal is to formally compare and contrast the associations by race/ethnicity.  The hypothesis that disruption of circadian rhythms is a risk factor for prostate cancer is promising, but has been addressed somewhat superficially; there are only sparse data from the few studies of advanced disease and no study has been conducted within a racially/ethnically diverse population. However, the careful investigation of this novel hypothesis in the proposed study could substantially increase our understanding of modifiable risk factors for prostate cancer, especially for aggressive disease, and also specifically identify risk factors that contribute to disparities. The results of this study are highly translational (potentially by alterng melatonin levels and sleep patterns), and could illuminate opportunities for primary and secondary prevention. Moreover, the utilization of a large established cohort with pre-existing genetic data makes this study highly efficient and cost-effective. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our study aims to investigate circadian disruption as a risk factor for prostate cancer in a multiethnic cohort, a study noteworthy since African-American men are more likely to be diagnosed and are twice as likely to die of the disease compared to white men. Using an integrative molecular epidemiological approach, we aim to evaluate the interplay between common variation in circadian related genes, a urinary biomarker of melatonin levels, race/ethnicity and obesity on prostate cancer risk. The goal is to provide epidemiological data that could be translated into primary and secondary prostate cancer prevention, and potentially novel avenues for prostate cancer therapy.",Circadian

"Modeling to Improve Prostate Cancer Outcomes Across Diverse Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. In the US, 1 in 7 men will experience a prostate cancer diagnosis in his lifetime. Identifying ways to reduce the burden of prostate cancer is therefore a top research priority. Management of prostate cancer has changed dramatically since the advent and widespread dissemination of the PSA test. Since the early 1990s, prostate cancer mortality in the US has dropped by almost half. The CISNET Prostate Working Group (PWG) was formed to use disease modeling to explain these mortality trends. The CISNET PWG has developed three models of prostate cancer natural history, detection, and survival and calibrated them against US prostate cancer trends. Results indicate that both screening and treatment changes have reduced prostate cancer deaths. However, policies must be tailored to limit harms and costs associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Different approaches for doing this have been proposed but cannot all be investigated in prospective studies. The objective of this application is to utilize and extend the CISNET PWG models to identify tailored and targeted intervention strategies that offer the most benefit while limiting harms and costs. We will determine whether we can improve screening further by using novel stratification approaches and also whether we can safely limit harms of overtreatment by judicious choices of primary and secondary therapies. These approaches will be applied in the US population and in international cancer control settings that may require modified strategies. We will provide decision makers with model access via online calculators with graphical user interfaces. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Identify active surveillance strategies that minimize patient burden without increasing risks of progression to non-curable disease or death. Aim 2: Develop stratified approaches to prostate cancer screening that target high-risk men based on polygenic risk and baseline PSA at age 45. Aim 3: Model secondary treatment strategies, their impact, and implications for population prostate cancer control. Aim 4: Determine whether racial disparities in prostate cancer mortality can be reduced by using stratified screening and treatment strategies. Aim 5: Modularize models to evaluate cancer control programs in non-US populations and collaborate with investigators in the UK and the Caribbean to develop policies for their populations and resources. Aim 6: Develop online calculators to support patient-physician decisions and policymaker deliberations about PSA screening and treatment for localized prostate cancer. These aims are highly responsive to the funding opportunity announcement, addressing 6 of the 9 targeted priority areas. Our cumulative expertise in prostate modeling, our existing models, and our close ties with clinical experts who provide access to large, high-quality datasets for model validation and calibration position us well to uniquely contribute to the national and international dialogue about how best to address and control this most common cancer in men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative The most effective ways to prevent, treat, and manage prostate cancer remain uncertain. Our team of investigators uses a unique inter-disciplinary approach for bringing together high-quality data from a wide range of sources and developing unified models of cancer progression to answer the most critical questions. In this application, we will examine efficiency gains of screening only high-risk individuals, benefits of avoiding or delaying treatment for low-risk cancers, and feasible approaches for reducing racial disparities. This work will advance the evidence necessary to make informed decisions about screening and treatment for this most common cancer in men.",Modeling to Improve Prostate Cancer Outcomes Across Diverse Populations,9762862,U01CA199338,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Calibration ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Europe ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Funding ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' prostate cancer detection ', ' detect prostate cancer ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Model ', ' CancerModel ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' PSA screening ', ' PSA test ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment strategy ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' process optimization ', ' surveillance strategy ', ' prostate cancer model ', ' prostate tumor model ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' support tools ', ' genetic signature ', ' gene signatures ', ' practice setting ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,U01,2019,1083429,0.4349953699951303
"A Multilevel Intervention to Increase the Participation of African Americans in Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer clinical trials are essential to translating research into tangible benefits for patients, but only a small number of patients enroll in a trial Under-enrollment of minorities is an even greater problem because it limits the generalizability of findings and contributes to treatment disparities. Minority under-enrollment in prostate cancer trials is especially troublesome because of the higher incidence, morbidity, and mortality of this cancer among African American men, as compared to White men. The overall goal of our research is to improve cancer care and reduce racial/ethnic cancer disparities by increasing rates at which African American men with prostate cancer make an informed decision to participate in a trial, based on high-quality communication with their physician. In this application, we propose a theory-based multilevel intervention designed to influence African-American patients' attitudes about physicians and about trials; physicians' attitudes about patients and about trials; and patient-provider clinical interactions in which trials may be discussed. The intervention is designed to improve these outcomes: patient understanding of trials and decisions to participate; physician decisions to discuss and offer trials; patient-physician communication; and ultimately, participation rates among African Americans with prostate cancer. We base the intervention on our prior research showing that patient and physician attitudes and beliefs often result in trials not being discussed during clinic visits, or when trials are discussed, communication is ineffective. These factors are even greater in racially discordant visits, and likely contribute to low trial enrollment among African Americans. We will conduct the proposed research at two NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers that provide care in urban areas. African American and White men will be included to allow comparison of the effects of the intervention by patient race. The intervention has two phases. Phase 1 is a randomized trial in which intervention group patients receive a tool to improve their attitudes about trials and increase their active participation in clinic visits in which trials maybe discussed. Phase 2 is an interrupted time series quasi-experiment in which physicians receive an intervention to improve their attitudes about trials and their communication during discussions of trials with patients. Data will include patient and physician self-reports, video recordings of patient-physician clinic visits, and medical records. We propose three Specific Aims: 1) determine the independent and combined effects of each phase of the intervention on outcomes; 2) compare the effects of the intervention on outcomes for African American versus White men; and 3) examine the extent to which patient-physician communication mediates the relationship between the intervention and outcomes. This research is highly significant and innovative because it tests a new conceptual model focusing on patients, physicians, and clinical interactions, and uses social psychological and communication theory to improve clinical practice. Findings should provide evidence for a practical, exportable intervention to increase trial enrollment among African American men with prostate cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinical trials are necessary to make progress in preventing and treating prostate and other cancers. Clinical trials to benefit a large, diverse community, members of majority and minority populations must participate, but minorities are underrepresented.

"Modulation of host intrinsic immunity to reduce prostate cancer disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer health disparities represent a major public health concern in the United States. Even when socioeconomic factors are accounted for, minority populations have higher overall incidence rates and worse outcomes than the overall population. Prostate cancer is one such disease with higher incidence and death rates in African American (AA) men than Caucasians. Although socioeconomic factors may be blamed to a certain extent, it is appreciated that the genetic composition makes AA men more susceptible to aggressive prostate cancer. Genetic and epigenetic changes are known as tumorigenic drivers because epigenetic editing precludes mounting of host antitumor response necessary for tumor cell clearance. DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), is the best-characterized epigenetic modification in prostate cancer, and racial disparities in DNA methylation are associated with cancer prognosis and survival. Therefore, targeting of DNMT to reverse epigenetic alterations is an appealing therapeutic target, and vital to reduce the observed prostate cancer outcome gaps among AA men and Caucasians. The deoxycytidine analogue decitabine is unique in that it can be repositioned for non-cytotoxic depletion of DNMT. We characterized a low dose of decitabine with its increased absorption in the presence of tetrahydrouridine (THU). Combination of THU with decitabine changes its pharmacology, and facilitates non-cytotoxic DNMT1 depletion. We demonstrated that the THU-decitabine combination significantly inhibits the growth of TRAMP-C2 prostate tumors in immune competent mice, and the addition of CpG immunotherapy further enhanced antitumor immunity. Based on our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that THU-decitabine directed epigenetic therapy revitalize the host intrinsic immunity and augment vaccine-induced antitumor response. Since DNA methylation is prevalent and relates to greater risk in AAs, DNMT depletion will invigorate the immune response of tumor-bearing host, providing an opportunity to immunotherapy inducing robust antitumor immunity. We will test the combination of THU-decitabine directed DNMT depletion, immune modulation and therapeutic vaccine to determine 1) the effect of epigenetic editing on prostate cancer cell growth in murine models; and 2) the effector mechanism of THU-decitabine guided vaccine- induced antigen-specific antitumor immunity in complete regression of early and advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. This project is novel because the concept of a non-toxic THU-decitabine combination with immunotherapy has not been tested in any cancer type. This combinatorial approach will significantly attenuate the growth of aggressive prostate cancer as often presented in AA men, and may represent a novel treatment to reduce prostate cancer disparity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer is the second highest cause of cancer related deaths for men in the United States. However, the unfortunate fact is that the African American men are disproportionally affected by prostate cancer with considerably high incidence and as much as twice the mortality rate than Caucasians. Determining the significance of the host immunity reconstitution following combination approaches of epigenetics editing and immunotherapy in race based prostate cancer is the major goal of this study. If our efficacy aims are achieved, the excellent safety profile of our non-cytotoxic regimen conducive to translate to humans is very promising aimed to reduce prostate cancer disparity.",Modulation

"Modeling Precision Interventions for Prostate Cancer Control PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor in men and the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. The Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) Prostate Working Group (PWG) was formed in the year 2000 to address a wide range of questions about effective prostate cancer control. The PWG studied the rapid increase in prostate cancer diagnoses after PSA screening started in the late 1980s to estimate lead time and overdiagnosis associated with the test. The PWG studied the decline in prostate cancer mortality that began in the early 1990s to quantify the plausible contributions of PSA screening and changes in primary treatments. The PWG also studied how to interpret trends in racial disparities in incidence and survival, how to manage men with low-risk disease on active surveillance, and how to reconcile apparently discordant randomized trials of PSA screening and radical prostatectomy. In recent years, technologies surrounding prostate cancer screening and treatment have evolved rapidly, and opportunities to improve patient care using personalized data abound. Genetic testing can identify men at increased risk for developing aggressive disease, new biomarkers and imaging tools can help men avoid unnecessary biopsies, and new hormonal treatments can lengthen survival for men with advanced disease. The objective of this application is to extend PWG models to evaluate optimal ways to utilize personalized data to improve patient care while limiting harms and costs. We will determine whether we can improve early detection using novel stratification approaches and whether we can safely limit overtreatment and other harms by tailored choices of primary and secondary therapies. These approaches will be applied in the United States and in international cancer control settings with different resources and priorities. Our specific aims are as follows. Aim 1: Precision early detection, including risk-stratified screening and biopsy using genetic tests, novel biomarkers, and imaging technology. Aim 2: Precision active surveillance, including adaptive biopsy intervals and imaging technology. Aim 3: Precision treatment, including type and timing of initial and salvage therapies. Aim 4: Targeting screening, biopsy, and treatment policies to reduce racial disparities. Aim 5: Prioritizing screening and treatment interventions in international settings. These aims are highly responsive to the funding opportunity announcement, addressing 7 of the 9 targeted priority areas to varying degrees. Our cumulative expertise in prostate modeling, our existing models, and our close ties with clinical experts who provide access to large, high-quality datasets for model validation and calibration put us in a strong position to answer critical and impactful questions about how best to control this most common cancer in men. PROJECT NARRATIVE The most effective ways to personalize the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer using data from an individual patient are unknown. Our team of investigators applies a unique inter-disciplinary approach that combines available data with modern statistical techniques to understand long-term effects of prostate cancer interventions. In this application, we will evaluate personalizing patient care, including screening high-risk men more frequently, using biomarkers and imaging tests to select patients for biopsy, using patient and cancer features to determine when and which kinds of treatment to offer, and practical approaches for reducing racial disparities. This work will advance the evidence necessary to make informed decisions about individualized screening and treatment for this most common cancer in men.",Modeling Precision Interventions for Prostate

"The 6th Biennial Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities in Black Men of African Ancestry PROJECT SUMMARY In 2010, the Prostate Cancer Transatlantic Consortium (CaPTC) organized the inaugural Science of Global Prostate Cancer Disparities (SGCaPD) in Black Men’s Conference to provide a platform for addressing the complexity of prostate cancer (CaP) disparity in Black men. Since the inaugural conference in 2010, the SGCaPD conference has fostered a unique approach to understand and address CaP disparities in Black men. With the support of the NCI, the previous biennial SGCaPD conferences have resulted in several scholarly achievements, including: (1) proceedings publications; (2) a global CaP special issue in ecancermedicalscience; (3) multi- institutional grant collaborations; (4) multi-institutional, trans-disciplinary prostate health disparity projects; (5) global CaP advocacy initiatives; (6) research guidelines; and (7) a standardized global CaPTC-AC3 Behavioral and Epidemiological (CABE) data elements and measures that are culturally appropriate for studying CaP in Black men globally. To continue to meet our long-term goal of eliminating the CaP disparities experienced by Black men, we are proposing the sixth Biennial SGCaPD Conference. For the first time, the conference will be held in Europe and will focus on fostering research skills and sharing research results that develop and test the feasibility of CaP-relevant interventions in Blacks or determines the biological basis for CaP disparities in Blacks. This application plans to foster research collaborations among 20 Early Stage Investigators (ESIs) from North America, Europe, Africa and the Caribbean for global CaP research collaborations in one of four areas: (1) Genomics; (2) Bioinformatics/Data Science; (3) Behavioral Research; and (4) Clinical Research.

"Prostate Cancer Health Disparity: Role of PDEF In African American (AA) men prostate cancer is characterized by higher aggressiveness, more extensive metastases, early onset, and increased mortality rates compared to those in Caucasian men. We propose to evaluate role of PDEF (Prostate Derived Ets Factor) and TWIST-1 in PCa health disparity. The studies proposed in this application are driven by our novel observations that there is graded decrease in PDEF levels in prostate cancer cells with increasing aggressive phenotype and in prostate cancer tissue sections of patients. We also observed in multiple clinical data sets that PDEF mRNA expression is decreased in high Gleason grade PCa and in tumor metastasis. Moreover we observed a reciprocal relationship between PDEF and Twist-1 expression in PCa tissues and that PDEF and Twist-1 expression could predict PCa patient survival. In preliminary studies we observed that PDEF expression is decreased in prostate cancer cells from AA men and in cells with aggressive phenotype, and experimental modulation of PDEF expression modulates cell migration and clonogenic activity in part by promoting luminal differentiation. These exciting preliminary data form the basis of our proposed hypothesis: First, that, “ In African American Men PDEF could serve as a functional marker for distinguishing aggressive prostate cancer from an indolent disease.” Second that “PDEF functions as a metastasis suppressor in prostate cancer in part by modulating expression of Twist-1”, and third that “Loss of PDEF can help us stratify PCa patients that might respond to DNA methyl transferase inhibitors”. We propose three aims to test these hypothesis. AIM 1: To establish differences in expression levels of PDEF between grade-matched Prostate Cancer specimens from African American and Caucasian men and correlate these with patient outcomes; AIM 2: To determine the role of PDEF in PCa metastasis and racial disparity using in vivo model systems, and ; *AIM 3: To evaluate if prostate cancers with PDEF loss respond more favorably to combination of ADT (Enzalutamide) and DNA methyl-transferase inhibitors (azacytidine and decitabine) as compared to ATD alone. The proposed studies are innovative as these will enhance understanding of role of PDEF in suppressing prostate cancer metastasis and help us evaluate usefulness of PDEF/Twist-1 in early detection of patients that may harbor aggressive prostate cancer with enhanced metastatic potential. The impact of our study will be on the development of a new method to distinguish aggressive and metastatic phenotype of prostate cancer from an indolent disease, which will particularly benefit AA men, and reduce ethnic disparity in in prostate cancer treatment outcomes. In African American (AA) men prostate cancer is characterized by higher aggressiveness, early onset, more extensive metastases, and increased mortality rates compared to those in Caucasian men. Conventional therapies produce a high rate of cure for patients with localized prostate cancer, but there is no effective treatment for intervention in metastatic prostate cancer. Currently-used prognostic indicators (Digital rectal exam, PSA measurement and Gleason score) do not predict metastases risk accurately. These facts underline the urgent, yet unmet, need for identification and characterization of new targets that can help distinguish between aggressive and metastatic prostate cancer from an indolent disease. Our goal is to address this vital knowledge gap by characterizing the role of Prostate Derived Ets Transcription Factor (PDEF) in PCa aggressiveness, thereby reducing the prostate cancer-related health disparity between African American (AA) and Caucasian men. We propose a novel and unique causative link between PDEF and metastases. Our proposal also details mechanistic experiments that may help to patient stratification and use PDEF expression as a means to stratify patients to demethylating agents. Our studies will pave the way for routine clinical use of PDEF as an independent predictor of metastases risk.  ",Prostate Cancer Health Disparity: Role of PDEF,10165289,R01CA242839,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Azacitidine ', ' 5 AZC ', ' 5-AC ', ' 5-Aza-cytidine ', ' 5-Azacytidine ', ' AZC ', ' Azacytidine ', ' ladakamycin ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Mission ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Morbidity -

"Genetic Literacy and Patient-Caregiver Communication of Prognostic Genetic Technology for Localized Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Novel genomic technology, such as microarray analyses and next-generation sequencing, have improved the understanding of prostate cancer biology and prognosis. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), in 2016, recommended that patients and clinicians consider tissue-based genetic tests for localized prostate cancer. However, while much enthusiasm currently exits for the rapidly increasing field of genomic medicine, the use of multi-gene mRNA expression panels raises the potential for further divergence in prostate cancer treatment outcomes by race and low socioeconomic status. We know that health disparities persist in low income groups despite the existence of evidence-based guidelines and that adoption of state-of-the-art methods often lag behind in these groups. The goals of this NCI K01 application are to (1) explore how men with localized prostate cancer and their caregivers comprehend prognostic genetic technology, and (2) examine how an educational video about genetics impacts patient-caregiver communication of prognostic genetic technology. The study rationale is that without direct attention to genomic comprehension, the enthusiasm that exists in the rapidly increasing field of prostate cancer genomic medicine may not translate into health benefits for men with localized prostate cancer. The central hypotheses are (1) men and caregivers with lower levels of education will demonstrate a severe lack of genomic comprehension of tissue-based genetic tests for localized prostate cancer; and (2) tailored prostate cancer education, communication coaching, and a genomic literacy educational video will significantly improve patient-caregiver communication in a low literacy population. The study approach is innovative because it applies a mixed-methods community-engagement research framework to explore how African American and rural White men with localized prostate cancer, comprehend and interpret data generated from genetic technology. The proposed research is significant because of its potential to improve public health by (1) improving the understanding of prognostic genetics in minority, low income, and rural populations, and (2) engage and educate these diverse communities about genomics. The proposed research, in combination with a structured mentoring and training plan that includes didactic course and workshops, is designed to facilitate Dr. Ewan Cobran’s long term goal of developing an independently-funded research program in prostate cancer disparities, consistent with the mission of the NCI.

"Multidiciplinary Integrative Genomic Approach to Distinguish Lethal from Indolent Prostate Cancer in Men of Europena and African Ancestry ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are several critical unmet needs in the management of localized prostate cancer. Central among them is the development of minimally invasive tools to distinguish localized cancers that are truly indolent from cancers that are progressive and potentially lethal. To address this key need, we first propose to perform an integrated, multi-dimensional genomic, epigenomic and expression analysis to uncover novel molecular pathways that characterize indolent vs. aggressive prostate cancers. In this approach we define indolent tumors as those screen detected (e.g. PSA screening) lesions that are Gleason score 6 (or less) that are organ confined at radical prostatectomy. We consider these tumors indolent as they do not appear capable of metastasis. In contrast, we equate Gleason score 8-10 tumors as ""interval"" or symptomatic since, even with primary treatment, these tumors often recur and metastasize at high frequencies. Additionally, we will validate our key markers/pathways discovered in this project using additional populations with long term outcomes. We hypothesize that our multi-modality genomic-based integrated approach, contrasting these two divergent tumor types, will reveal signatures that distinguish cancers with dichotomous phenotypes. We also hypothesize that these signatures will vary based on race and thus in parallel we will comprehensively characterize African American prostate cancers to reveal molecular features driving racial disparities in outcomes. We will validate the signatures obtained using large cohorts of cases with established outcomes including: (1) the Johns Hopkins Active surveillance cohort and (2) Prostate cancer cases from the BLSA (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), an observational cohort of men followed since 1954 with autopsy documented indolent or aggressive/lethal disease. We also propose that these signatures will be able to predict outcomes of cancers with indeterminate kinetics and propose to test this through analysis of cases of intermediate risk prostate cancer with long-term follow-up and known outcomes from Johns Hopkins and in collaboration with colleagues from Harvard, from the Physician's Health and Health Professionals follow-up studies. Together this work will yield highly relevant information that can be directly applied to the clinical management of localized prostate cancer. Specifically, it will yield an integrated signature that distinguishes localized - indolent tumors from localized tumors with lethal potential. Additionally we believe these signatures will be critical in determining treatment strategies for individuals with prostate cancers of indeterminate kinetics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The key unmet need in the management of prostate cancers pivots around the dilemma of the screen detected tumor as clinicians balance over treating cancers that are indolent with delaying/under-treating cancers that are aggressive and pose harm. Nomograms containing clinical and pathologic variables are helpful but additional minimally invasive methods are needed to improve their predictive capabilities. This project, which will comprehensively characterization prostate cancers and their microenvironment from both Caucasian and African American men, will inform unique pathways that modulate these two states and allow the development of novel minimally invasive tools that improve patient care.",Multidiciplinary Integrative Genomic Approach to Distinguish Lethal from Indolent Prostate Cancer in Men

"Epigenomic and transcriptomic markers of aggressive prostate cancer among African American men PROJECT SUMMARY  African American men experience a disproportionate burden of aggressive prostate cancer and prostate cancer mortality when compared with white men. The underlying reason for the disparity is unclear and the ability to predict an individual patient's disease trajectory remains limited. This makes treatment decisions difficult, particularly as available treatments range widely from active surveillance to radical prostatectomy, which can have severe consequences such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. There is growing evidence to support the potential of DNA methylation (DNAm) and RNA expression markers in prostate tumors to enhance prostate cancer prognostication beyond clinical factors, but few studies to date have focused on African American men.  The present pilot study will leverage a unique patient population (>40% African American) and archival radical prostatectomy prostate tissue from the University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center. Aims 1 and 2 propose to leverage array-based technology to investigate whether DNAm and RNA expression markers can discriminate between aggressive (total Gleason score>7) and non-aggressive prostate cancer (total Gleason<7) in African American men. We will use Gleason score as our endpoint because it is available for all samples and because recent studies have supported its utility as an intermediate endpoint in the discovery of prognostic markers. Aim 3 proposes integrated analyses of DNAm and RNA expression data to investigate the hypothesis that some DNAm markers are associated with aggressive disease independently of expression, thereby providing unique prognostic information.  The K07 mechanism will allow me to receive essential training in the integration/application of tumor tissue biomarkers in epidemiological studies and analysis of high-dimensional data under the guidance of a strong team of mentors with synergistic expertise in molecular epidemiology, prostate tumor biomarkers, bioinformatics/computational genomics, and statistics (Drs. Joanne Dorgan, Lorelei Mucci, Héctor Corrada Bravo and SØren Bentzen). Dr. Arif Hussain, a genitourinary oncologist and basic science researcher in prostate cancer, will serve as an additional advisor and contribute to the interpretation and assessment of clinical significance of findings. My previous research has focused on blood-based biomarkers in targeted genomic regions and I will greatly benefit from specialized training in tumor tissue markers and expanding to high-dimensional data as I move towards independence in molecular cancer epidemiology. Moreover, this study will provide preliminary data that will build toward a larger (R01) application in which I will integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data for the discovery of novel biomarkers of aggressive prostate cancer among African American men. My long-term goal is to lead studies that will promote improved public health and reduce disparities in cancer outcomes through personalized medicine. Project narrative: The overall public health objective of this proposed study is to identify biomarkers that will improve risk- stratification for African American men with prostate cancer, who bear a disproportionate burden of aggressive disease and prostate cancer mortality, but have been underrepresented in previous studies. This research, in turn, will allow for more personalized treatment/management strategies that have potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce disparities in prostate cancer mortality.",Epigenomic and transcriptomic markers of aggressive prostate cancer among African American men,9964717,K07CA230182,"['Archives ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maryland ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methylation ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Tumor Markers ', ' TM-MKR ', ' tumor biomarker ', ' tumor specific biomarker ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Genitourinary system ', ' Genitourinary ', ' Urogenital ', ' Urogenital System ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Avian Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Homolog ', ' myc Oncogenes ', ' MYC gene ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' DNA analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Indolent ', ' Erectile dysfunction ', ' Oncologist ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' microarray analyses ', ' microarray technology ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' K07 Mechanism ', ' K07 Program ', ' Academic/Teacher Award ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Epidemiology of Cancer ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' 8q24 ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Molecular ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' epigenomics ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' patient population ', ' treatment strategy ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' epigenome ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' methylation marker ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' Data Discovery ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' individual patient ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' individualized management ', ' individualized patient management ', ' personalized clinical management ', ' personalized disease management ', ' precision management ', ' personalized management ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' blood-based marker ', ' blood-based biomarker ', ' Risk stratification ', ' high dimensionality ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K07,2020,138440,0.34999015562962754
"Evaluation of Transperineal Biopsy under Local Anesthesia, a Novel approach to Decrease Post-Biopsy Infections and Improve Cancer Detection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in U.S. men. There are approximately 1 million prostate biopsy (Bx) performed annually in the U.S. Almost all Bx are performed as an office based procedure in under 15 minutes. The precision of Bx has improved over the last decade with the introduction of MRI guidance/targeting of suspicious lesions within the prostate. However, significant limitations remain with this approach, including a significantly increasing risk of post-Bx infection. This arises because more than 97% of all prostate Bx are performed via a transrectal (TR) approach that introduces rectal bacteria with each pass of the Bx needle into the sterile urinary tract. The current risk of post-TR Bx infection, even with antimicrobial prophylaxis, is high at approximately 7% overall with 3% (30,000 men) requiring hospitalization annually. Transperineal (TP) Bx is an alternate approach that eliminates the direct introduction of bacteria from the rectum to the prostate. This approach, which is perfomed without antimicrobial prophylaxis, instead passes the Bx needle through the perineal skin and pelvic floor. TP Bx has not been widely adopted for several reasons. Historically, it has been considered too painful for patients in the clinic and thus was traditionally performed under general anesthesia. The added time, inconvenience and cost has limited its national adoptance. Second when TR Bx was initially adopted over 40 years ago, antibiotic resistance of rectal flora was not a challenge. Beyond the potential for in-office TP Bx to significantly reduce or eliminate Bx infections, TP Bx may also improve cancer detection as studies of TP Bx (performed under general anesthesia) demonstrate higher detection rates for prostate cancer, particularly for anterior zone tumors, compared to TR Bx. This is notable as anterior tumors are difficult to sample with TR Bx. Anterior tumors are also twice as likely to occur in African American men. In fact, our research demonstrates that some of the outcomes disparities in African American men may stem from an underdiagnosis of anterior prostate cancers. Although TR Bx is used widely, it is associated with a significant and increasing risk of Bx infections due to growing antibiotic resistance, highlighting the urgent need for a safer alternative approach to prostate Bx.  We have refined a TP Bx approach under local anesthesia with MRI-targeting/guidance without the need for antibiotic prophylaxis. We hypothesize that TP MRI targeted Bx will: (1) largely eliminate post-Bx infections and costly hospitalizations for urosepsis; (2) be performed in the office with similar discomfort and non-infectious complications compared to TR MRI targeted Bx; and (3) have significantly better detection of prostate cancer. A multi-center randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate in-office TP MRI targeted vs. TR MRI targeted Bx, the current gold standard. This has transformative impact to change current standard of practice. The investigators have a track record for collaboration. The environment comprises 4 high-volume, SPORE funded centers of excellence that serve diverse populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately one million transrectal prostate biopsies are performed annually in the U.S., and the risk of post- biopsy infection is increasing due to greater antibiotic resistance of rectal flora. Preliminary data demonstrates that a transperineal MRI-targeted biopsy approach under local anesthesia compared to the standard practice transrectal MRI-targeted prostate biopsy has a much lower risk of infection, comparable pain/discomfort and may improve detection of prostate cancer. Our pivotal randomized controlled trial will be the first prospective study to evaluate in-office transperineal MRI targeted prostate biopsy, and if our hypotheses proves true transperineal MRI-targeted biopsy will become the new standard of care and significantly reduce post-biopsy infections and increase detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.","Evaluation of Transperineal Biopsy under Local Anesthesia, a Novel approach to Decrease Post-Biopsy Infections and Improve Cancer Detection",9973695,R01CA241758,"['Adoption ', ' General Anesthesia ', ' Local anesthesia ', ' Local Anesthetics ', ' Conduction-Blocking Anesthetics ', ' Bacteremia ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacteriuria ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Environment ', ' Gold ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Infection ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Needles ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Public Health ', ' Rectum ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Urinary tract ', ' Urinary Retention ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' rectal ', ' Anterior ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Pelvic Floor ', ' Pelvic floor structure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' detect prostate cancer ', ' prostate cancer detection ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Antibiotic Premedication ', ' Antibiotic Prophylaxis ', ' Attenuated ', ' Transrectal Ultrasound ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' sterile ', ' Sterility ', ' novel ', ' Equipoise ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' cost ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' anti-microbial ', ' antimicrobial ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' stem ', ' tumor ', ' standard of care ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' prostate biopsy ', ' infection risk ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' ']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,737794,0.28864669095626283
"Metabolic Rewiring Promotes AA PCa by Regulating Stromal-Epithelial Interaction The long-term objective of our research plan is to reduce the disproportionate effects of prostate cancer on African American men. In this application, we have used the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover underlying biochemical differences between prostate cancers of African American and European American origin. Metabolomics describes the science of quantifying the levels of metabolites (e.g., small molecules) that are the byproducts of cellular metabolism. That is to say, in this kind of analysis we are measuring the biochemical entities (or metabolites) that are produced by the functional machinery of the cell. With knowledge of the identity of specific metabolites we can infer the biological processes that produced them, thus gaining insight into a cell’s metabolism. Given this, a guiding principle of application is that unique biochemical differences exist between prostate cancers of African American and European American origin and that these differences can influence the tumors and their surrounding cells termed stroma such that together they can promote the progression of the tumors. Since African American prostate cancer grow and progress more rapidly than European American tumors, our studies will potentially address some of the causes underlying prostate cancer health disparity. In addition, it will also build a first-of-its-kind biomarker panel that can predict cancer recurrence in ancestry verified African American men with prostate cancer. In this proposal, we will i) identify the biochemical mechanism that drives elevated levels of inosine in African American Prostate Cancer, ii) evaluate the function of elevated inosine in making African American tumors aggressive and invoke tumor promoting properties in the surrounding stromal cells and iii) develop plasma based metabolic markers for biochemical recurrence in African American men. At the conclusion of this study, we will have developed a racially derived metabolomic model for prostate cancer as well as identified candidate pathways for future drug targeting. We would have also built a proof-of-principle metabolite-based test with the ability to predict cancer recurrence based on the ancestry of the patient. In the longer term, this test will be validated and translated into a clinical assay that should have the ability to predict the recurrence of prostate cancer in an ancestry informed fashion in prostate cancer patients. At present, it is not known how the prostate cancer metabolome contributes to health disparities. The information gleaned from this proposal could rapidly revolutionize current diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches by revealing the biological underpinnings of prostate cancer health disparity.

"MULTI-OMICS APPROACH ON NIGERIAN MEN WITH PROSTATE CANCER Project Summary/Abstract This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-20-032. Compared to other ancestral groups, men of African ancestry (MAA) have the highest incidence and mortality of prostate cancer (Prostate cancer), with African men having the highest. Although socio-economic factors have been shown to contribute to this disparity, the sum of those factors fails to adequately explain the magnitude of the impact. Multiple studies have demonstrated that genetic/biologic differences in African American (AA) tumor biology contribute to Prostate cancer development and aggressiveness. Moreover, there is building evidence to support that the observed differences are population specific and form unique paths to cancer aggressiveness. Unfortunately, most contemporary evidence, regarding Prostate cancer in MAA, focus on AA men not African men. This lack of adequate representation greatly diminishes the ability to not only identify meaningful clinical interventions for this patient population but also the opportunity to investigate the shared genetic background of both groups for causal disease variants, overlaid by gene expression. Thus, this necessitates a greater emphasis on the need for a multi-omics approach to identifying clinical interventions that can help these underrepresented patient population. To more broadly understand the role of mutations and that lead to events such as DNA methylation in patients with African Ancestry, we performed whole exome sequencing of Nigerian Prostate cancer FFPE samples to determine the mutational landscape of men with prostate cancer in West Africa. Interestingly, we found that a number of novel mutations, however mutation signatures suggest that Nigerian Prostate tumors contain a substitution bias toward C>T and T>C transitions, thus increasing the possibilities for DNA methylation patterns in this population. Furthermore, since our lab for the past decade has demonstrated that Kaiso is a master regulator of multiple methylated genes expression, and that Kaiso is associated with suppressive immune microenvironment, we propose the following aims: Specific Aim 1 - Perform DNA methylation profiling on Nigerian Prostate Cancer Patients; and Specific Aim 2 Perform Multi-Spectral Imaging of Nigerian Prostate Cancer FFPE samples. Project Narrative This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-20-032. Compared to other ancestral groups, men of African ancestry (MAA) have the highest incidence and mortality of prostate cancer (Prostate cancer), with African men having the highest.

"Mitochondria in Prostate Cancer Diversity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The androgen receptor (AR) plays an important role in normal development of the prostate gland, in prostate carcinogenesis, and in the progression of prostate cancer to advanced metastatic disease. Traditional thinking is that AR localizes exclusively to the nucleus and that nuclear AR regulates genes that are essential to prostate cancer development. This is true. However, we demonstrate a previously unrecognized function of AR in mitochondria. We have discovered that AR 1) directly localizes into the mitochondria and 2) indirectly transcriptionally regulates nuclear genes whose products localize into mitochondria and perform mitochondrial functions. Our studies reveal that i) AR localizes into mitochondria in primary prostate tissues and cell lines, ii) AR is imported into isolated mitochondria, and iii) AR contains a mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) capable of targeting foreign proteins, such as green fluorescent protein, into mitochondria. Indirectly, AR controls expression of a variety of nuclear DNA (nDNA)-encoded mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mtOXPHOS) subunits, including NDUFB8 (Complex I), SDHB (Complex II), UQCRC2 (Complex III), COXII subunit (Complex IV), and ATP5A (Complex V). AR also down-regulates the TFAM, GFM1, and GFM2 genes, which control mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content. Consistent with this, the mtDNA content and the expression of mtDNA-encoded COX II protein is significantly reduced in PC3-AR prostate cells expressing AR. Notably, we demonstrate that the mtDNA content in prostate tumors of African-Americans (AA) is >6 times less than in tumors of Caucasian-Americans (CA). mtDNA content was also lower in normal prostates of AA than CA. To identify the underlying mitochondrial basis of prostate cancer diversity, we conducted comprehensive, race-based bioinformatics analyses of variants in more than 6000 AA and 33,000 CA and discovered, in the AR gene of AA, missense variants located in two domains: the N-terminal domain containing the MLS and the DNA-binding domain. Of note, missense mutations in CA were found only in the hinge domain containing the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of AR. Expression of AR variant S598G in PC3 cells reduced more than the wild type the expression of TFAM, which controls mtDNA content. We hypothesize that AR missense variants/mutants present, solely in AA, contribute to the ""gain"" or ""loss"" of mitochondrial function and thereby to prostate cancer diversity in AA. AIM 1: Determine the prognostic significance of AR missense variants/mutants and mtDNA content on prostate cancer metastasis and reoccurrence in AA and CA. AIM 2: Evaluate the significance of mitochondrial AR missense variants/mutants as direct regulators of mitochondrial functions that affect composition, organization, stability, and activity of mtOXPHOS super-complexes and apoptosis. AIM 3: Evaluate the significance of nuclear AR missense variants/mutants as indirect regulators of mitochondrial function. AIM 4: Use mouse xenograft model to establish the significance of mitochondrial and nuclear AA- and CA-specific AR missense variants/mutants on prostate tumorigenesis and metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our proposed study will characterize a previously uncharacterized mitochondrial mechanism regulated by androgen receptor underlying the prostate cancer aggressiveness in AA men.",Mitochondria in Prostate Cancer Diversity,9901469,R01CA204430,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Androgens ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Mitochondrial DNA ', ' mtDNA ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Oxidative Phosphorylation ', ' Oxidative Phosphorylation Pathway ', ' Play ', ' Ploidies ', ' DNA Content ', ' DNA Index ', ' DNA Ploidy ', ' chromosome complement ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Proteins ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' cell transformation ', ' transformed cells ', ' oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein ', ' ATP50 ATP synthase subunit ', ' OSCP protein ', ' complex V ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Green Fluorescent Proteins ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Germline Mutation ', ' Hereditary Mutation ', ' Germ-Line Mutation ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Genetic ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Complex ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' Nuclear ', ' NLS Peptide ', ' Nuclear Localization Signal Peptide ', ' Nuclear Localization Signal ', ' American ', ' mutant ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' receptor expression ', ' complex IV ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Polymorphism Detection ', ' Polymorphism Analysis ', ' Mitochondrial Proteins ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Coenzyme Q-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Coenzyme QH2-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Complex III ', ' Cytochrome b-c2 Oxidoreductase ', ' Dihydroubiquinone-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' QH(2)-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' QH(2)-Ferricytochrome-c Oxidoreductase ', ' Ubihydroquinone-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Ubiquinol-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Ubiquinol-ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase ', ' Ubiquinone-Cytochrome b-c2 Oxidoreductase ', ' Electron Transport Complex III ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Address ', ' Dihydrotestosterone Receptor ', ' NR3C4 ', ' SMAX1 ', ' androgen receptor gene ', ' AR gene ', ' Basic Cancer Research ', ' DNA-Binding Protein Motifs ', ' DNA Binding Domain ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' N Domain ', ' Xenograft Model ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' mitochondrial genome ', ' early onset ', ' PC-3 ', ' PC-3 cell line ', ' PC3 ', ' PC3 cell line ', ' NH2-terminal ', ' N-terminal ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' prostate tumorigenesis ', ' prostate carcinogenesis ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' prognostic significance ', ' prostate cancer metastasis ', ' prostate cancer progression ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,336263,0.2294814012724256
"Cyclic Peptide Protease Inhibitors for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer Although new therapies have had an impact prolonging the quality and quantity of life of men suffering from prostate cancer (PCa), novel treatments are urgently needed to combat aggressive forms of the disease. Recently, we made several key discoveries in the development of therapeutic peptides targeting the membrane bound metalloprotease aminopeptidase N (APN) in aggressive subtypes of PCa. To accurately and reliably interrogate the expression of APN in PCa tissues, we identified a novel antibody by phage display that specifically recognized APN in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues. This antibody allowed us to screen PCa tissue microarrays (TMAs) with a fidelity never before seen. Immunohistochemistry analysis of patient biopsies and TMAs found that APN was preferentially overexpressed in non-androgen receptor (AR) driven PCa compared to AR-driven prostate adenocarcinoma. We also documented in a race disparity TMA and patient biopsies that APN was expressed in the PCa of African-American men while absent in Caucasian patients. Both African- American men and men with non-AR driven PCa represent patient populations who exhibit aggressive disease with poor overall survival. Using a rational design approach based off of the substrate specificity of APN, we identified a cyclic peptide (Leu-His-Ser-Pro-Trp = cLHSPW) that was a micromolar inhibitor of APN’s enzymatic activity. This peptide was found to be moderately therapeutic in APN-expressing PCa xenografts at high doses. Tethering of two cLHSPW peptides together by a linker created a dimer with enhanced potency in vitro and in vivo. The dimer was a nanomolar inhibitor of APN and was rapidly internalized by the cancer cell. When administered at the same high dose as the monomer, the dimer led to complete tumor attrition in vivo. These findings suggest that higher order multivalent cLHSPW peptides may be effective APN-targeted therapeutics. In this proposal, we will synthesize dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric cLHSPW peptides using macrocyclic frames. In addition to ease of synthesis, the macrocyclic frames can also chelate radiometals for positron-emission tomography (PET). To develop a new class of PCa therapeutics, the in vitro therapeutic efficacy of the peptides will be characterized and PET imaging will be performed in vivo to monitor biodistribution (Aim 1), the ability of the peptides to eliminate tumor burden in subcutaneous xenografts will be examined (Aim 2) and X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy will be performed on APN complexed with the peptides to obtain mechanistic insights and ultimately lead to the development of optimized inhibitors (Aim 3). Our preliminary data strongly suggest that we have developed potent therapeutics that have the potential to result in a dramatic shift in how aggressive PCa is treated. There is an urgent unmet need to develop innovative, effective therapies against aggressive prostate cancer subtypes. The goal of this project is to develop novel cyclic peptide therapeutics targeting the enzymatic activity of a metalloprotease that we found to be overexpressed in non-androgen receptor driven disease and the prostate cancer of African American men. This approach has significant clinical potential to result in new treatment modalities for subtypes of prostate cancer that are currently incurable.",Cyclic Peptide Protease Inhibitors for the

"Constructing a Relational Bridge to Achieve High-Quality Prostate Cancer Care for African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prostate cancer (PCa) imposes a disproportionate burden on African American men, who have a 63% higher incidence, are more often diagnosed with aggressive disease, and have more than twice the mortality rate of White men. Among the causes of excess mortality is failure to receive definitive treatment (e.g., surgery and radiation) when it would be most beneficial (under-treatment). In addition, over-treatment of low-risk disease (therapies that may not be beneficial yet have serious side effects) contributes to disparities in quality of life, as African American men report more treatment-related side effects that translate to lower quality of life. All of these disparities are most pronounced among low income African American men, many of whom have low health literacy, and receive treatment in low resource settings (e.g., public hospitals and other safety net systems), underscoring the need for targeted research in this setting. PCa treatment options present daunting communication challenges even for high literacy patients, as there are complex trade-offs between survival and quality of life that are very personal. To mitigate this perfect storm of complex treatment options and constraints in communication, we will construct a relational bridge between low income African American men and equal PCa treatment by anchoring the evidence-based intervention of peer navigation in the relational concept of African American brotherhood as a means to foster trust and empowerment, and thus to optimize patient-centered communication and quality of care. Our specific aims are to: (1) develop a multi-dimensional understanding of current PCa care and treatment decision processes among African American safety net patients; (2) adapt an existing peer navigation intervention to empower African American PCa patients as partners in high quality patient-centered PCa care; and (3) pilot test the adapted peer navigation protocol for feasibility and acceptability, and for impact on patient centeredness and treatment chosen. This K01 project will have significant impact by directly targeting multiple elements of PCa treatment quality in a single integrated approach. The candidate, Nynikka Palmer, DrPH, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in General Internal Medicine at San Francisco General Hospital, University of California, San Francisco with secondary appointments in the Departments of Urology and Radiation Oncology. With support from an exceptional mentoring team, and execution of interconnected training and research activities, Dr. Palmer will carry out formal coursework, independent mentored learning, and experiential learning that converge around three key topics: (1) depth in cultural understanding and methods via ethnography, (2) patient-centered health communication intervention development and implementation, and (3) design and conduct of randomized controlled trials. This K01 project will facilitate Dr. Palmer's long-term career goal to become an independent investigator who develops, implements, and disseminates culturally meaningful interventions to improve the quality of cancer care and reduce the burden of PCa among African American men. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American men bear an excess burden of prostate cancer that can be attributed in part to disparities in optimal treatment, which are exacerbated by low levels of health literacy among patients treated in low resource settings where time constraints and communication barriers degrade quality of care. The goal of the proposed training and research is to address these barriers by bridging the divide between low-income African American men and equal prostate cancer treatment with the evidence-based intervention of peer navigation adapted through the relational concept of African American brotherhood as a means to foster trust and empowerment, and thus to optimize patient-centered communication and quality of care.",Constructing a Relational Bridge to Achieve High-Quality Prostate Cancer Care for African Americans,9999298,K01CA211965,"['Appointment ', ' Awareness ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hearing ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Impotence ', ' impotent ', ' Incidence ', ' Incontinence ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' literacy ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Urology ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Caring ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Survivors ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Research Activity ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' uptake ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' treatment planning ', ' Familiarity ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Radiation ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' active method ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' prostate cancer treatment ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', ' safety net ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' PSA test ', ' prostate specific antigen screening ', ' prostate specific antigen test ', ' PSA screening ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' patient engagement ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' side effect ', ' prostate survivors ', ' prostate cancer survivors ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2020,184680,0.13782088229025793
"Racial Disparity in the Expression of Androgen Receptor Splice Variants (AR-SVs) in Prostate Cancer Approximately 174,000 men in the United States were diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) and approximately 31,000 died of PCa in 2019. The number of PCa survivors is expected to increase from 3.3 million men currently to 4.5 million by 2026. One of the primary reasons for treatment failure and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) relapse is expression of constitutively-active AR splice variants (AR-SVs) that lack the ligand binding domain (LBD) and thus remain constitutively active. AR-SVs contribute to an aggressive phenotype of CRPC, shorter progression-free survival (PFS), and failure to respond to enzalutamide or abiraterone. Compared to Caucasian men, African American men have a 63% higher overall PCa incidence (228.8 vs 140.3 per 100,000, age adjusted to 2000 US population). These patients are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive/potentially lethal PCa, are 2.44-fold more likely to die from PCa and have shorter disease-free survival. Our central hypothesis is that the higher incidence of aggressive CRPC in African American men is due to the higher expression and function of AR-SVs compared to their Caucasian counterparts. As our SARDs are the only set of molecules having the properties to degrade the AR-SVs, proving this hypothesis will help us to tailor our drug development protocols towards the African American men who might have higher expression of AR-SVs. To address the hypothesis that the African American men express AR-SVs at a higher level than Caucasian men, we will determine the expression of AR-V7 in PCa and CRPC specimens from African American and Caucasian men (specific aim-1), determine race differences in AR-V7 function by quantifying AR-V7-target gene signature expression in PCa tissue from African American and Caucasian PCa patients (specific aim-2), and test the efficacy of SARDs in CRPC patient-derived xenograft UT-1335 that was obtained from an African American man (specific aim-3). The data will be a harbinger for future drug development tailored towards African American men with PCa. Prostate cancer and its aggressive form castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are more prevalent and aggressive in African American men than in Caucasian men. African American men with prostate cancer have shorter progressive-free and overall survival than Caucasian American men.

"KAPS Biotech: A novel biomarker to improve prostate cancer diagnosis Abstract Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most common non-skin cancer in men and third most common cause of cancer deaths in men. Black men experience a higher burden of incidence and mortality from CaP compared to White men. The Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test, a commonly used biomarker for early diagnosis and management of CaP, cannot alone accurately predict the presence of CaP, its aggressiveness, or the risk of post-treatment recurrence. The widespread use of PSA testing in CaP screening is controversial partially because patients with benign enlargement of the prostate often have elevated levels of PSA and many men with diagnosed CaP have a normal PSA. Consequently, a search for more effective prostate tumor biomarkers is overdue. KAPS Biotech’s preliminary studies show that concurrent measurements of the levels of serum cytokines such as IL-8, TNF-α, and sTNF-R1 (KAPS biomarker) provide a significant advantage as a CaP biomarker over PSA measurements alone in differentiating men with CaP from men without CaP. However, these preliminary studies were carried out on a small sample and essentially contained no Black men. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both Black and White men with CaP have altered circulating levels of KAPS biomarker compared to men without CaP. Further, the extent to which these levels are altered will vary according to CaP risk factors and can be used as a tool to improve the early detection of CaP and CaP treatment decision-making. Due to the reported significant racial differences in the diagnoses of and mortality from CaP, future CaP biomarker studies should include a racially diverse sample of men, especially Black men. Therefore, newly developed biomarkers must be validated in a robust and racially diverse population of men to improve the specificity of CaP diagnosis and to better inform CaP treatment decision making. To test the central hypothesis, this Fast Track proposal proposes the following specific aims: Phase I: A small, one-year prospective proof-of-principle study to determine whether KAPS biomarker (concurrent measurements of IL-8, TNF-α, and sTNFR1) can distinguish those with CaP from those without CaP among Black and White men. Phase II: A large, prospective cohort study to address the following aims:  1. Determine whether KAPS biomarker can prospectively distinguish those with CaP from those without  CaP among a large sample of Black and White men.  2. Determine whether KAPS biomarker can prospectively distinguish men with high-risk CaP from those  with indolent CaP among a large sample of Black and White men with CaP. Narrative The Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test is currently the most commonly used prostate cancer biomarker. The PSA test has a 70% false positive and 30% false negative rate, meaning that, each year in the United States, approximately 700,000 men undergo unnecessary prostate biopsies and more than a million men are overtreated for prostate cancer. KAPS biomarker (which measures three relevant biomarkers at the same time) outperforms the PSA test both in detecting prostate cancer and in differentiating between high- and low-risk prostate cancers.",KAPS Biotech: A novel biomarker to improve prostate cancer diagnosis,9807275,R42MD013412,"['Adoption ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Biopsy ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Serologic tests ', ' Serological Tests ', ' serology ', ' Societies ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tumor Markers ', ' TM-MKR ', ' tumor biomarker ', ' tumor specific biomarker ', ' United States ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Seminin ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' improved ', ' PSA Assay ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Assay ', ' Prostate specific antigen measurement ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Indolent ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' detect prostate cancer ', ' prostate cancer detection ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' tool ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' prostate enlargement ', ' PSA level ', ' prostate specific antigen level ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' TNF gene ', ' (TNF)-α ', ' Cachectin ', ' Macrophage-Derived TNF ', ' Monocyte-Derived TNF ', ' TNF ', ' TNF A ', ' TNF Alpha ', ' TNF-α ', ' TNFA ', ' TNFα ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' CD 120a Antigen ', ' CD120a Antigens ', ' TNF Receptor p55 ', ' TNF-sR55 ', ' TNF-α receptor ', ' TNFAR ', ' TNFR p60 ', ' TNFR, 55-kD ', ' TNFR, 60-kD ', ' TNFR-I ', ' TNFR1 ', ' TNFR55 ', ' TNFR60 ', ' TNFRSF1A ', ' TNFRSF1A Receptor ', ' TNFalpha receptor ', ' TNFα receptor ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1 ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 55 ', ' tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor ', ' tumor necrosis factor receptor 1A ', ' tumor necrosis factor α receptor ', ' TNFRSF1A gene ', ' 3-10C ', ' AMCF-I ', ' CXCL8 ', ' GCP1 ', ' IL-8 ', ' IL8 ', ' K60 ', ' SCYB8 ', ' TSG-1 ', ' b-ENAP ', ' IL8 gene ', ' Address ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' prospective ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' PSA test ', ' prostate specific antigen screening ', ' prostate specific antigen test ', ' PSA screening ', ' high risk ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' prostate biopsy ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' cancer markers ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' cancer survival ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' ']",NIMHD,"KAPS BIOTECH, INC.",R42,2020,483890,0.22329798724551772
"Contributions of tumor molecular subtypes to prostate cancer racial disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT African American men (AAM) disproportionately experience the burden of prostate cancer with a mortality rate approximately 2.4-fold greater than that observed among white men in the U.S. This represents the single largest known cancer disparity by race in the U.S., and it may reflect both biologic heterogeneity in the cancers that arise in AAM, as well as differences in socioeconomic factors that influence healthcare utilization. The relative contribution of sociocontextual and biologic factors to prostate cancer disparities remains unclear. Prostate cancers are phenotypically and molecularly heterogeneous, and a better understanding of tumor subtypes by race may aid in the understanding of disease etiology and disparities. Preliminary evidence suggests that low grade tumors in AAM have a higher propensity for progression. The identification of intrinsic subtypes in other cancers, such as breast cancer, has had profound implications for our understanding of the underlying biology and clinical management of those cancers. I hypothesize that the clinical management of prostate cancer can be further optimized for AAM with further understanding of molecular tumor heterogeneity. I will leverage transcriptomic and clinical data from the Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate Network and GenomeDx Decipher Genomic Resource Information Database™ to investigate molecular tumor subtypes with respect to prostate cancer disparities. To that end, I will: 1) characterize the PAM50 subtypes in prostate cancer by self-identified race/ethnicity and assess their prognostic value; 2) use tumor transcriptomic data to derive, validate, and characterize novel prostate cancer subtypes among AAM; 3) assemble a retrospective cohort of AAM with low-grade prostate cancer to identify molecular predictors of tumor progression. These research aims are supported by a comprehensive training plan tailored to my training goals: 1) developing an applied knowledge of advanced concepts in prostate cancer biology, epidemiology, and disparities, and 2) developing a bioinformatic and computational biology skillset. This research and training plan will provide me with the skill set to establish a career as a leader in molecular prostate cancer epidemiology and disparities research. To help me accomplish these goals, I will receive guidance from a team of experts in molecular prostate cancer research, who will help expand my knowledge of prostate cancer epidemiology, disparities, biology, pathology, clinical management, and methods for tumor molecular profiling. With the support of my mentor, Advisory Panel, and the rich training environment of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, this award will help facilitate my transition to research independence.

"Co-targeting obesity in prostate cancer chemoprevention and therapy Project Summary/Abstract The objective of the proposed project is to determine the combined effect of a combination of natural products arctigenin and green tea (GT), with and without a MCP-1 signaling inhibitor RS 504393 (RS) in prevention and treatment of prostate cancer particularly in obese mouse models. Obesity greatly increases the challenge in cancer prevention and treatment. Obesity promotes tumor development and progression to aggressive forms and subsequent metastasis, as observed in most types of cancer, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer. In addition, obesity induces resistance in tumor cells to therapeutic drugs, leading to the failure of treatments. Therefore, an ideal approach in cancer chemoprevention and therapy should co-target obesity as well, ideally in a non-toxic manner. However, most of the current chemotherapeutic drugs have little activity on obesity, and their efficacy is often limited by side effects. Natural product like GT has been shown to be effective against multiple chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. We demonstrated in vitro in a co- culture obesity model that the combination of arctigenin, a novel natural anti-inflammatory lignan, with GT significantly enhanced the anti-proliferative effect in both prostate cancer cells and adipocytes, along with reduced concentrations of adipocytes-secreted IGF-1 and VEGF in culture medium. The combination of RS, a selective MCP-1 receptor CCR2 inhibitor, with arctigenin and GT led to elimination of prostate cancer cells in obese state in vitro. The proposed project will confirm the combined effect of arctigenin, GT, with and without RS in vivo in obese mouse models fed a high-fat diet which simulates the Western-style diet, with low-fat diet fed mice as comparison. Specific aim 1 will determine the combined effect of arctigenin and GT in prevention of prostate cancer in transgenic PTEN knockout mice. Aim 2 will investigate the therapeutic effect of arcigenin, GT and RS in inhibition of tumor growth and prevention of metastasis using both transgenic and xenograft mouse models. Aim 3 will identify the molecular mechanisms of the combination with a focus on their anti- angiogenic activities. The proposed project will make significant contributions to the control of prostate cancer by providing a highly effective and non-toxic modality through co-targeting obesity in cancer prevention and treatment. This combination will contribute to the elimination of prostate cancer incidence, mortality and cancer disparities with its potential low cost, culturally acceptability, and feasibility in addition to its efficacy. In addition to prostate cancer, both GT and arctigenin have shown efficacy against other types of cancer, including breast and colorectal cancer. Therefore this combination is anticipated to bring benefits to patients in treatment of multiple cancers. Project Narrative The proposed project is anticipated to provide a highly effective novel regimen through a combination of two natural non-toxic plant products with or without a synthetic drug to improve current chemoprevention and therapy in prostate cancer. This combination will counteract the tumor-stimulating signals of obesity in addition to targeting tumor itself thereby to enhance the preventive and therapeutic effect.",Co-targeting obesity in

"Integrating Genomics and Metabolomics to Develop Predictive Models of Prostate Cancer in Multiethnic Men PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death among American men, with men of African ancestry have the highest PCa incidence and mortality rates. While the causes of this notable health disparity are unknown, there is evidence of genetic contributions and it is likely that environmental factors contribute as well. However, most PCa research has focused on men of European descent, particularly genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which has resulted in polygenic models having poorer predictive value in non- Europeans. The overarching goal of this research is to identify genomic and metabolomic factors that contribute to PCa risk in multiethnic men. To facilitate the construction of a genome-wide multiethnic polygenic risk score (PRS), in the K99 phase of this research, Dr. Darst will develop a novel variant selection algorithm to identify informative variants among genome-wide data (Aim 1). She will then construct a multiethnic genome-wide PRS using a large multiethnic PCa sample (PRACTICAL, N=237,380) (Aim 2). This PRS will be developed on overall PCa (Aim 1A), aggressive PCa (Aim 2B), and age of PCa onset (Aim 2C) and is expected to lead to improved predictive value compared to a PRS of ~150 known variants and to a PRS developed using Europeans only. Dr. Darst's expertise in genetic epidemiology will be complemented with additional training in cancer epidemiology, advanced statistical genomics, and cancer health disparities received through coursework, seminars, conferences, and guidance provided by her expert mentoring team. In the R00 phase, Dr. Darst will initiate a new line of research the applies integrative techniques to investigate combined genomic and metabolomic factors influencing PCa risk. This will build directly upon the research and training received in the K99 period. She will identify genetically-regulated metabolites that could be causally associated with PCa in multiethnic populations (Aim 3). This will require developing a large multiethnic metabolomics imputation panel and using subsequent meta-analysis summary statistics to develop genome-wide multiethnic PRS for each investigated metabolite. These PRS will be used to impute metabolomics into the PRACTICAL consortium. A metabolome- wide association study will then be performed to identify imputed, or genetically-regulated, metabolite levels that are predictive of overall PCa or aggressive PCa. Using a subset of 1,186 African American men from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, Dr. Darst will investigate metabolites that could mediate the effects of genetic factors, including the PRS from Aim 2, on overall and aggressive PCa (Aim 4a). She will also use integrative techniques to identify genomic and metabolomic factors that distinguish subgroups of individuals with high PCa risk (Aim 4b). Results are expected to substantially improve our ability to detect high risk individuals who would benefit from earlier or more intensive PCa screening across multiethnic populations and provide novel biological mechanisms to target for preventative measures, likely reducing PCa mortality and the number of indolent PCa cases treated unnecessarily. PROJECT NARRATIVE This investigation is focused on identifying polygenic and metabolomic factors that contribute to prostate cancer risk in multiethnic men. Results from this research are expected to substantially contribute to our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to prostate cancer risk and health disparities and improve predictive models of prostate cancer across ethnic and racial populations.

"Identifying and Reducing Disparities in Patient-Reported Outcomes Among African American Prostate Cancer Survivors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We propose a project to reduce morbidity as related to health disparities in prostate cancer survivors by identifying disparities in symptom burden and their contributors among African American prostate cancer survivors. The limited research reported that patient-reported quality of life outcomes are worse in African American compared to White prostate cancer survivors. Most importantly, other critically important symptom burden outcomes are largely understudied and overlooked in minorities. Previous research suggests African American prostate cancer survivors likely experience signiﬁcant symptom burden for outcomes that are avoidable or treatable. The proposed project will address these critical public health concerns in the growing population of African American prostate cancer survivors.! This project aims to 1) Compare symptom burden between African American and White prostate cancer survivors, 2) Identify multilevel modiﬁable risk factors for worse symptom burden among both African American and White prostate cancer survivors, such as cultural, health behavior-related, psychosocial, and racial discrimination factors, and 3) Identify multilevel non-modiﬁable risk factors for worse symptom burden, such as genetic, clinical, treatment-related, and demographic factors. The risk factors we will study are informed by an adapted multilevel contextual model examining the levels of the person, social environment, and healthcare system.! This will be among the ﬁrst and most comprehensive studies we are aware of to compare symptom burden between African American and White prostate cancer survivors. It will be the ﬁrst we are aware of to identify modiﬁable and non-modiﬁable risk factors for worse symptom burden. These risk factor data will allow us to develop targeted interventions and identify high-risk individuals for monitoring and early intervention. In summary, this project's focus on identifying disparities and their risk factors supports the Healthy People 2020 goals of eliminating health disparities and improving quality of life in cancer survivors. PROJECT NARRATIVE! This will be among the ﬁrst and most comprehensive studies we are aware of to compare symptom burden between African American and White prostate cancer survivors, and it will be the ﬁrst to identify modiﬁable and non-modiﬁable risk factors for symptom burden in this population. Identifying risk factors for these outcomes will 1) allow us to develop interventions that target risk factors using evidence-based approaches and 2) lead to development of early support interventions for survivors at greatest risk.",Identifying and Reducing Disparities in Patient-Reported Outcomes Among African American Prostate Cancer Survivors,9971155,R01CA242742,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Saliva ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' poor sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Time ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Survivors ', ' race discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Hormonal ', ' psychosocial ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' DNA bank ', ' DNA Library ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Monitor ', ' urinary ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' modifiable risk ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' prostate tumor model ', ' prostate cancer model ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' recruit ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' prostate survivors ', ' prostate cancer survivors ', ' ']",NCI,H.
