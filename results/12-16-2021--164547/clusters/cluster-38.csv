"RURAL ELDERS: ETHNICITY, FOOD MEANING & DIET MEASUREMENT  This study builds on the investigators' ongoing research of gender                                                                             and ethnic differences in nutritional self-management of older adults in two         rural North Carolina counties (RO1 AG 13469) to investigate the meanings and         beliefs rural older adults have for food, diet and the relationship of food and      diet to health. This study addresses the problem of using such information to        adapt existing dietary instruments to more accurately collect nutrient and food      intake data. This study will: (1) document older rural adults' meanings of           foods and their cognitive models of nutrition; (2) compare and contrast food         meanings and cognitive models of nutrition by ethnic group (African American,                                               Native American, European American); and (3) identify cultural and                   socioeconomic predictors of differences in food meanings and cognitive models        of nutrition that result in health disparities. Based on what is learned in the      first three specific aims, this study will: (4) use the food and diet meanings       to adapt two existing dietary intake instruments to be more culturally                                                                                   appropriate for this population; and (5) evaluate the new dietary intake                                           instruments. The research is divided into 2 phases. Phase I data collection          includes individual in-depth and group interviews. In-depth individual               interviews will be completed with 48 African American, European American and         Native American females and males aged 70 and older who reside in two rural          North Carolina counties.

"Health Food, Healthy Schools and Healthy Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The social and built environments affect food consumption patterns that influence disease occurrence and public health.  Health disparities arise when environmental factors make it difficult to access healthy food choices.  Access factors that influence dietary choices include the cost, availability and physical accessibility of healthy foods.  Residents of neighborhoods that lack affordable sources of healthy food may experience higher rates of overweight and diabetes, resulting from differences in the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains versus foods that are high in calories, added fat, and sugars, and low in other nutrients.  The local nutrition environments created by such factors can, however, be changed if community members are actively involved in shaping community nutrition norms and influencing policies that increase the availability of affordable healthy foods.  Such proactive intervention has the potential to reduce the health disparities for overweight and diabetes that plague low-income communities and communities of color.      The goal of the project is to facilitate positive community-driven changes in local nutrition environments in schools and communities that suffer disproportionately from diet-related poor health conditions.  The project will evaluate access factors in those schools and communities; raise nutrition, environmental and food access awareness; develop and implement intervention strategies; and assess the environmental and policy impact of those strategies.  Activities include the training of low-income African-American and Latino students, parents, and residents to undertake community and school food assessments; the development of appropriate and feasible action plans to address poor nutrition environments and policies; and the creation of local community nutrition advisory councils to mobilize efforts to move intervention strategies forward.  The project hypotheses are:  1) through participation in community and school food assessments and the development of community nutrition councils, school and community members will have increased awareness and knowledge of the health disparities related to lack of access to health-promoting foods; and 2) increased awareness and the development of community-driven strategies for environmental and policy change will in turn lead to improved nutrition environments that reduce risk factors for overweight and diabetes.

"Racial Disparities in Food Environments and Diet 22. Racial/Ethnic Differences and Health Disparities Objective: The relationship between diet and disease is well established. The elderly population is the fastest growing sub population in the United States. The ability to prevent diet related acute and chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease and cancer, is particularly important for this group of Americans. Unfortunately efforts to modify individuals' diets by education have been largely unsucessful. Derminants of food purchasing patterns suggest people's dietary choices are affected by their local environments. However the relationship between the local food environment and senior's diets has not been studied. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the availability and consumption of fruits and vegetables by elderly residents of New York City. Other reseach suggests the elderly are particularly reliant on their local environment for goods and services due to increasing prevalence of disability and decreasing income. Therefore seniors may be a sensitive subpopulation at risk for poor dietary intake when living in a restricted food environment. Methods: A cross sectional study is proposed where eligible elderly participants will be selected from predominately white, predominately black, low and high weath neighborhoods. A sampling scheme has been developed to measure the joint effect of racial segregation and wealth on the location of places that sell fruits and vegetables. Participants will be interviewed over the phone regarding their (a) usual consumption of fruits and vegetables, (b) shopping patterns and (c) access to transportation. In addition, the location of places that sell food in these neighborhoods will be gained from regulatory agencies and food stores will be surveyed for the price and quality of fruits and vegetables sold. We will use a multi-level approach to our statistical analysis to investigate the assocation between the availabilty of fruits and vegetables and comsumption by residents. Conclusions: The results of this reseach will provide more effective intervention strategies for modifying dietary consumption as well as generate hypotheses for future research.

"Language/theory/food conception and eating behavior DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary composition is an important contributor to childhood overweight risk, but interventions to alter food preferences (and therefore choices) have limited efficacy. Our understanding of how food preferences are transmitted between individuals, how modeling functions to increase food acceptance, how repeated exposure increases liking, and how children extend a preference from one food to another is limited. An improved understanding of how these basic mechanisms operate to shape food preferences and choices could be applied to the development of more sophisticated, directed, and effective eating behavior interventions that would have broad applicability in homes, schools, communities, and via the media. Eating behavior, food preferences, and cognitions around food all develop rapidly in the preschool age range, and therefore early childhood is targeted as the period for study and eventual intervention. The study of eating behavior development has not yet been merged with the rapidly developing knowledge base in children's language development, concept formation, and theory of mind. This proposal seeks to develop and explore potential connections between several domains of child development and eating behavior, thereby providing the basis for needed interventions to address increasing rates of childhood overweight.  Specific Aim I: To determine how characteristics of foods contribute to young children's concept formation around food, and whether or not these conceptions are associated with extension of a newly formed food preference.  Specific Aim II: To determine the effect of food-related language, familiarity, and recall in influencing young children's food preferences, and if these effects are transmitted across different settings.  Specific Aim III: To determine how young children use theory of mind to evaluate the validity and applicability of a model's food preferences in guiding their own eating behavior.  Research Design: Given the growing disparities in child overweight risk based on socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity, the population studied will be low-income children of minority ethnicity aged 3-5 years attending Head Start in both urban and rural settings. Children will participate individually in a series of experimental paradigms testing hypotheses related to each of the three Specific Aims. All research will be conducted in children's natural settings (at Head Start). Translation of laboratory findings to classroom mealtime behavior will be tested. Results of the proposed experiments will lead to the development of an intervention program to alter children's food preferences and eating behavior that will be tested in subsequent studies.

"Health Food, Healthy Schools and Healthy Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The social and built environments affect food consumption patterns that influence disease occurrence and public health.  Health disparities arise when environmental factors make it difficult to access healthy food choices.  Access factors that influence dietary choices include the cost, availability and physical accessibility of healthy foods.  Residents of neighborhoods that lack affordable sources of healthy food may experience higher rates of overweight and diabetes, resulting from differences in the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains versus foods that are high in calories, added fat, and sugars, and low in other nutrients.  The local nutrition environments created by such factors can, however, be changed if community members are actively involved in shaping community nutrition norms and influencing policies that increase the availability of affordable healthy foods.  Such proactive intervention has the potential to reduce the health disparities for overweight and diabetes that plague low-income communities and communities of color.      The goal of the project is to facilitate positive community-driven changes in local nutrition environments in schools and communities that suffer disproportionately from diet-related poor health conditions.  The project will evaluate access factors in those schools and communities; raise nutrition, environmental and food access awareness; develop and implement intervention strategies; and assess the environmental and policy impact of those strategies.  Activities include the training of low-income African-American and Latino students, parents, and residents to undertake community and school food assessments; the development of appropriate and feasible action plans to address poor nutrition environments and policies; and the creation of local community nutrition advisory councils to mobilize efforts to move intervention strategies forward.  The project hypotheses are:  1) through participation in community and school food assessments and the development of community nutrition councils, school and community members will have increased awareness and knowledge of the health disparities related to lack of access to health-promoting foods; and 2) increased awareness and the development of community-driven strategies for environmental and policy change will in turn lead to improved nutrition environments that reduce risk factors for overweight and diabetes.

"Language/theory/food conception and eating behavior DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary composition is an important contributor to childhood overweight risk, but interventions to alter food preferences (and therefore choices) have limited efficacy. Our understanding of how food preferences are transmitted between individuals, how modeling functions to increase food acceptance, how repeated exposure increases liking, and how children extend a preference from one food to another is limited. An improved understanding of how these basic mechanisms operate to shape food preferences and choices could be applied to the development of more sophisticated, directed, and effective eating behavior interventions that would have broad applicability in homes, schools, communities, and via the media. Eating behavior, food preferences, and cognitions around food all develop rapidly in the preschool age range, and therefore early childhood is targeted as the period for study and eventual intervention. The study of eating behavior development has not yet been merged with the rapidly developing knowledge base in children's language development, concept formation, and theory of mind. This proposal seeks to develop and explore potential connections between several domains of child development and eating behavior, thereby providing the basis for needed interventions to address increasing rates of childhood overweight.  Specific Aim I: To determine how characteristics of foods contribute to young children's concept formation around food, and whether or not these conceptions are associated with extension of a newly formed food preference.  Specific Aim II: To determine the effect of food-related language, familiarity, and recall in influencing young children's food preferences, and if these effects are transmitted across different settings.  Specific Aim III: To determine how young children use theory of mind to evaluate the validity and applicability of a model's food preferences in guiding their own eating behavior.  Research Design: Given the growing disparities in child overweight risk based on socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity, the population studied will be low-income children of minority ethnicity aged 3-5 years attending Head Start in both urban and rural settings. Children will participate individually in a series of experimental paradigms testing hypotheses related to each of the three Specific Aims. All research will be conducted in children's natural settings (at Head Start). Translation of laboratory findings to classroom mealtime behavior will be tested. Results of the proposed experiments will lead to the development of an intervention program to alter children's food preferences and eating behavior that will be tested in subsequent studies.

"Dairy Foods and Blood Pressure in Multi-Ethnic Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension is an increasing health problem in children along with obesity and metabolic risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease (i.e. lipids, glucose, and insulin). An adequate dairy food, in particular calcium from dairy foods, has been reported to diminish hypertension and obesity, as well as risk factors associated with diabetes and heart disease. National data consistently document that calcium intake is not adequate in children, especially in minority children and these children show increased levels of hypertension, obesity, and metabolic risk factors compared to the majority. The primary aim of this application is to provide an intervention using increased dairy (and thus calcium intake) to diminish hypertension in multiethnic, elementary school children in grades 3-5. Secondary aims are to evaluate the impact of the intervention on obesity and risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We propose to randomize 26 elementary schools to either intervention or control. Children at the intervention schools will receive 2 servings of dairy foods (approximately 600 mg calcium) per day as snacks at school for 6 months. Children at the control schools will receive no snacks. Our primary hypothesis is that children in the intervention schools will show smaller increases in systolic blood pressure subsequent to the intervention compared to children in the control schools. We have a number of secondary aims that are important themselves and will increase our understanding of the effects of dairy products on risk factors. We expect obesity as measured by BMI and percent body fat to show smaller increases in the dairy group compared to the control group in children who are overweight or obese. Additionally, we expect decreases in blood lipids, glucose, and insulin in the dairy group compared to the control group, especially in children with elevated values at baseline. If successful, this trial will illustrate a simple, minimal interventions strategy that can be easily disseminated and will diminish health risk in children.           ",Dairy Foods and Blood Pressure in Multi-Ethnic Children,7145861,R01HL080967,"['body composition ', ' body weight ', ' obesity ', ' blood glucose ', ' hypertension ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' middle childhood (6-11) ', ' dairy product ', ' human subject ', ' blood lipid ', ' diet therapy ', ' dietary calcium ', ' nutrition related tag ', ' African American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2006,675446,0.0964362698519708
"Obesity Among Older Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last few decades have witnessed a particularly rapid rise in weight and obesity for individuals of all ages. While weight growth in children and working-aged adults has received the most attention, the public health consequences of excess weight for the near-elderly and elderly are considerable. This research will identify the determinants of weight gain in these older populations, and the consequences for health. To guide the research, we will develop a dynamic economic model of weight gain that illustrates the relationships between food prices, exercise availability, income, and weight. The empirical investigation will begin with some descriptive analysis designed to characterize the changing age-profile of weight and weight gain, by socioeconomic status and other demographic characteristics. We then turn to two important economic determinants of weight: food prices and retirement. Previous studies have demonstrated a link between food prices and weight, but the relationship for the elderly is not known, nor is the effect of retirement. We present preliminary evidence that retirement has substantial effects on weight, and that these effects vary with occupational characteristics in theoretically predictable ways. Next, we examine the complex relationships between weight and health. We first propose to study the effect of food pricing and availability on nutritional status, using objectively measured data on blood nutrient levels. This provides insight into the way in which food intake, if properly targeted, can improve health. This leads naturally into an investigation of the causal impact of weight on health. We will use variation in weight generated by food price variation and state-level exemptions of food from sales taxes. We will explore the effect of this variation in weight on health. Finally, we propose policy analyses based on our work. We will investigate the effect of hypothetical food taxation policies on weight, health, and nutrition.         ",Obesity Among Older Americans,7242620,R01AG025743,"['Insurance ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Simulate ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Restaurants ', ' Retirement ', ' Running ', ' Sales ', ' Societies ', ' Nutritional status ', ' Taxation ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Underweight ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Occupational ', ' Physical environment ', ' American ', ' functional status ', ' nutrient blood level ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' simulation ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Economic Models ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Nutritional ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Food ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' ']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2007,225956,0.1259763806199241

"Etiology of Childhood Obesity: A Longitudinal Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Etiology of Childhood Obesity (ECHO) study is to examine the etiology of childhood obesity using a socio-ecological approach considering possible risk and protective factors at individual, family, school, and neighborhood levels. Obesity in adolescence is related to increased cardiovascular risk in adulthood. Approximately 60% of overweight youth have one CVD risk factor and another 25% have more than one risk factor. We will recruit 400 youth between the ages of 10 and 13 and one of their biological parents, conduct measurements and follow them for two years. We will target our recruitment to include youth who are at risk for, or who are overweight (at or above the 85th percentile of BMI using the CDC growth curves) and those who are in the recommended weight range and will over sample by zip code to ensure economic and racial/ethnic diversity. Individual measures on youth will include fasting blood glucose, blood lipids, anthropometry, blood pressure, and psychosocial, preference and socioeconomic status, family history related to weight including child's birth weight, early feeding (practices such as breast-feeding, family history of obesity and obesity-related chronic disease), family meal and activity patterns, and the home food and activity environments. We will measure the height, weight, waist and hip circumference of both of the youth's biological parents. For each youth in the study, we will collect data on their school environment including opportunities for physical activity, food options available in the school cafeteria and throughout the school, and school food and activity policies.

"Multiethnic Cohort Study of Diet and Cancer ¿' . ' ' ' . The Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study was designed to prospectively investigate the relationship of diet and other lifestyle factors to cancer risk in five ethnic groups (African Americans, Japanese Americans, Latinos, Native Hawaiians and Caucasians),and to explore interactions between these risk factors and genetic susceptibility to cancer. Since establishment of the cohort in 1993-96, more than 10 years of follow-up have accrued on the 215,000 participants, bringing the project to a point where its full potential can now be realized. In the current cycle of support, we are re-administering the baseline questionnaire to obtain updated (10-year) dietary and other information on the subjects (e.g., smoking, physical activity, hormonal usage, medications, intercurrent illnesses). We have been analyzing data from the baseline questionnaire, both dietary and non-dietary, as well as data on genetic susceptibility and gene-environment interactions. Altogether, we have published 50 papers from the cohort since early 2003. We have been among the most active participants in NCI's Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium, and have shared our data with other members of the consortium, as well as with investigators at outside institutions. For the next 5-year period, we have several dietary scientific aims, including further research into the basis for ethnic differences we observed in diet and cancer relationships, investigation of hypotheses related to dietary constituents recently added to our food composition table (e.g., trans fatty acids, heme iron, glycemic load, heterocyclic amines), study of some less common sites (e.g., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovary and kidney), more in-depth subgroup analyses (e.g., by histology and stage), and investigations of the relationship of diet to cancer survival. We also have several non-dietary scientific aims, particularly related to investigating as- yet unexplainable ethnic differences in breast and lung cancer risk. The important work necessary to maintain the cohort and its several databases will continue, including administration of another short follow- up questionnaire and regular enhancements to the unique food composition table. Finally, we will continue to train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. We expect this research not only to expand knowledge of the role of environmental risk factors and genes in cancer risk, but also to further an understanding of the basis for ethnic/racial disparities in cancer occurrence and survival.

"Food environment, diet quality, and disparities in obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will examine how the physical, social, and economic environments influence dietary choices and, thereby, contribute to disparities in obesity rates. The present hypothesis is that the low cost and easy access to energy-dense foods may be an independent predictor of higher obesity rates. This study will combine survey research techniques with novel methods of spatial analysis to obtain in-depth information about the participants' physical and food environment and their access to food sources. A telephone survey of a stratified sample of 2,000 adult residents of King County, WA, will provide self-reported data on the participants' socioeconomic position (SEP), shopping and eating habits, food expenditures, obesity, and health. All addresses will be geocoded to facilitate spatial analysis and mapping. Objective measures of SEP will be based on data at the most detailed resolution available -- the County tax assessor at the tax parcel level. Objective measures of physical access to three key food sources, defined for each respondent in terms of quality, distance and time, will be calculated at the individual level using custom GIS based applications and novel metrics of the physical environment. Custom programs within GIS software will capture and perform preliminary geometric analysis of geospatial data within the proximity of the survey participants' home environment and their chief food sources. Dietary energy density and monetary cost of individual diets will be estimated using local food prices and an additional diet questionnaire instrument that will be mailed to all 2000 study respondents. Local variation in food prices will be assessed using a market basket technique. Spatial analyses and multilevel regression models will be used to test the hypothesis that physical and economic access to foods sources may predict dietary energy density and obesity rates.          ","Food environment, diet quality, and disparities in obesity",7371535,R01DK076608,"['Data Reporting ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diet ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Food Assistance Programs ', ' Rate ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Expenditure ', ' Custom ', ' Food ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Planning ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' nutrition education ', ' diet education ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Physical activity ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Mails ', ' Maps ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Respondent ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Taxes ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Physical environment ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Disease regression ', ' Metric ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' land use ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' falls ', ' Diet Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Communities ', ' energy density ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2008,518844,0.29788866775919504
"Etiology of Childhood Obesity: A Longitudinal Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Etiology of Childhood Obesity (ECHO) study is to examine the etiology of childhood obesity using a socio-ecological approach considering possible risk and protective factors at individual, family, school, and neighborhood levels. Obesity in adolescence is related to increased cardiovascular risk in adulthood. Approximately 60% of overweight youth have one CVD risk factor and another 25% have more than one risk factor. We will recruit 400 youth between the ages of 10 and 13 and one of their biological parents, conduct measurements and follow them for two years. We will target our recruitment to include youth who are at risk for, or who are overweight (at or above the 85th percentile of BMI using the CDC growth curves) and those who are in the recommended weight range and will over sample by zip code to ensure economic and racial/ethnic diversity. Individual measures on youth will include fasting blood glucose, blood lipids, anthropometry, blood pressure, and psychosocial, preference and socioeconomic status, family history related to weight including child's birth weight, early feeding (practices such as breast-feeding, family history of obesity and obesity-related chronic disease), family meal and activity patterns, and the home food and activity environments. We will measure the height, weight, waist and hip circumference of both of the youth's biological parents. For each youth in the study, we will collect data on their school environment including opportunities for physical activity, food options available in the school cafeteria and throughout the school, and school food and activity policies.

"Obesity Among Older Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last few decades have witnessed a particularly rapid rise in weight and obesity for individuals of all ages. While weight growth in children and working-aged adults has received the most attention, the public health consequences of excess weight for the near-elderly and elderly are considerable. This research will identify the determinants of weight gain in these older populations, and the consequences for health. To guide the research, we will develop a dynamic economic model of weight gain that illustrates the relationships between food prices, exercise availability, income, and weight. The empirical investigation will begin with some descriptive analysis designed to characterize the changing age-profile of weight and weight gain, by socioeconomic status and other demographic characteristics. We then turn to two important economic determinants of weight: food prices and retirement. Previous studies have demonstrated a link between food prices and weight, but the relationship for the elderly is not known, nor is the effect of retirement. We present preliminary evidence that retirement has substantial effects on weight, and that these effects vary with occupational characteristics in theoretically predictable ways. Next, we examine the complex relationships between weight and health. We first propose to study the effect of food pricing and availability on nutritional status, using objectively measured data on blood nutrient levels. This provides insight into the way in which food intake, if properly targeted, can improve health. This leads naturally into an investigation of the causal impact of weight on health. We will use variation in weight generated by food price variation and state-level exemptions of food from sales taxes. We will explore the effect of this variation in weight on health. Finally, we propose policy analyses based on our work. We will investigate the effect of hypothetical food taxation policies on weight, health, and nutrition.         ",Obesity Among Older Americans,7434408,R01AG025743,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Economic Models ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Nutritional ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Food ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Simulate ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Restaurants ', ' Retirement ', ' Running ', ' Sales ', ' Societies ', ' Nutritional status ', ' Taxation ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Underweight ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Occupational ', ' Physical environment ', ' American ', ' functional status ', ' nutrient blood level ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' simulation ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2008,221225,0.1259763806199241
"Socio-Environmental Influences on Nutrition and Obesity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity rates are increasing in the US, with no signs of slowing; obesity is increasing in all age groups, races and both sexes. It is higher among women of reproductive age and is growing rapidly among children. In order to curtail this complex, global epidemic, it is critical to identify modifiable environmental risk factors such as food security status; proximity to supermarkets, fast food restaurants and recreational facilities; transportation; neighborhood safety and crime-that contribute to nutrition, health disparities, and obesity risk in these populations. Postpartum women are of particular interest because of changes occurring in weight and growth that are immediately influenced by their environments. The proposed research project will assess neighborhood and socio-environmental influences on nutrition and obesity by collecting a broad range of data on participants' communities an ongoing study of postpartum weight retention. Socio-environmental data will be collected and linked to a vast array of detailed individual-level socio-demographic, dietary and behavioral data existing on this cohort. The project's specific aims are: 1) To develop an enhanced framework for this analysis based on formal ethnographic study of the food environment; 2) Using this model, to assess the effect of environmental factors on dietary intake, food security status, and postpartum weight retention; 3) To assess the generalizability of the postpartum study sample by comparing them to women from a representative sample; and 4) To develop a spatially explicit, neighborhood food environment index related to obesity. This study involves data collection and analysis of compositional (e.g. census), contextual (e.g. food resources), and spatially derived data (e.g. distance to food resource) on health outcomes under the supervision of established investigators. Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will expand current understanding of the food environment and will inform further study of alternative strategies for measurement and analysis of environmental influences on health. The paramount goal of this career award is to furnish the PI with supervised research experience and didactic training in sociology, economics, hierarchical and spatial analysis; these experiences will lead to R01 submission and establishment of the PI as an independent investigator.

3)'focus on modifiable risk and protective factors and use state of the science methods to measure them; 4) be directed by an experienced and multidisciplinary team of investigators; and 5) provide essential information for multi-level interventions to prevent childhood obesity.              ",Etiology of Childhood Obesity: A Longitudinal Study,7645811,R01HL085978,"['Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Mediating ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' feeding ', ' Obesity associated disease ', ' Obesity related disease ', ' modifiable risk ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Glean ', ' Diet ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Preventive ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Distal ', ' Biological ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' obesity in children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Life ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Height ', ' Behavior ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' interest ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Physical environment ', ' preference ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Blood Chemical Analysis ', ' blood chemistry ', ' Blood Chemical Analyses ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Composition ', ' blood lipid ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Nutrient ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' ']",NHLBI,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2009,549781,0.06534561243950804
"Socio-Environmental Influences on Nutrition and Obesity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity rates are increasing in the US, with no signs of slowing; obesity is increasing in all age groups, races and both sexes. It is higher among women of reproductive age and is growing rapidly among children. In order to curtail this complex, global epidemic, it is critical to identify modifiable environmental risk factors such as food security status; proximity to supermarkets, fast food restaurants and recreational facilities; transportation; neighborhood safety and crime-that contribute to nutrition, health disparities, and obesity risk in these populations. Postpartum women are of particular interest because of changes occurring in weight and growth that are immediately influenced by their environments. The proposed research project will assess neighborhood and socio-environmental influences on nutrition and obesity by collecting a broad range of data on participants' communities an ongoing study of postpartum weight retention. Socio-environmental data will be collected and linked to a vast array of detailed individual-level socio-demographic, dietary and behavioral data existing on this cohort. The project's specific aims are: 1) To develop an enhanced framework for this analysis based on formal ethnographic study of the food environment; 2) Using this model, to assess the effect of environmental factors on dietary intake, food security status, and postpartum weight retention; 3) To assess the generalizability of the postpartum study sample by comparing them to women from a representative sample; and 4) To develop a spatially explicit, neighborhood food environment index related to obesity. This study involves data collection and analysis of compositional (e.g. census), contextual (e.g. food resources), and spatially derived data (e.g. distance to food resource) on health outcomes under the supervision of established investigators. Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will expand current understanding of the food environment and will inform further study of alternative strategies for measurement and analysis of environmental influences on health. The paramount goal of this career award is to furnish the PI with supervised research experience and didactic training in sociology, economics, hierarchical and spatial analysis; these experiences will lead to R01 submission and establishment of the PI as an independent investigator.

"Dietary Intake Patterns of N-Nitroso Compounds    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formative step towards assessing dietary intake of N-Nitroso compounds in populations to inform subsequent epidemiological investigations and dietary methodology. Lung, stomach, upper gastro-intestinal tract, pancreatic, colorectal, and brain cancers are leading causes of cancer morbidity and death. Mutagenic/carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds in foods have been described in the etiology of these cancers. In order to make a major impact on these cancers, a better understanding of novel dietary preventive strategies is essential. For example processed and preserved meats have a positive association with increased risk of cancer. However, investigations pursing estimates of N-nitroso intakes have been impeded by the lack of a database that summarized N-nitroso food values, and the food patterns driving their intake is unknown across the US population, among subgroups who are at risk for cancer. Lack of such knowledge is an important problem, because, without it, we are unable to fully identify the carcinogenic role of dietary N-nitroso compounds and to make public health recommendations to reduce their intake. To fulfill the gap, we recently developed a dietary database of N-nitroso compounds. The current project will take advantage of the existing N-Nitroso database and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 to validate and measure N-Nitroso compound intake in the total population and by subgroups (race/ethnicity, age group, BMI, income, and leisure activity). We will further explore the interaction of N-nitroso compounds and antioxidants, and the major food contributors of N-nitroso compounds according to population subgroups. The central hypothesis is that high dietary intake of N- Nitroso compounds alone and in interaction with other nutrients vary by subgroups. Using NHANES 2003-2004 dietary, demographic, and other variables in 5280 adults, our existing database of N-nitroso compound values will be linked to foods reported in two 24-hour dietary recalls per sample person. The main effects of the variables and their interactions will be examined by using the new NCI Method of estimating dietary intakes of compounds and foods with programs adapted for NHANES datasets. The proposed study is innovative because it will result in adapting dietary methodology for N-nitroso estimates, and combine existing resources of a N-nitroso dietary database, together with the dietary, demographic, and clinical data from a large national dataset. Information gathered from this study will be valuable in generating novel dietary related hypotheses for cancer case-control studies, and to identify foods and questions for improving dietary methodology specific for N-Nitroso assessment.              The results of this study will help in designing new strategies to target dietary attributes associated with N-nitroso intake by ethnic/racial subgroups and by lifestyle factors, and will address how diet contributes to cancer disparity among these groups. Findings from this study will also provide knowledge on food contributors and dietary patterns of N-nitroso intakes which can improve food frequency questionnaires used in cancer epidemiological studies.",Dietary Intake Patterns of N-Nitroso Compounds,7665286,R03CA135677,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diet ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Intake ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Primary Cancer Prevention ', ' Chemopreventive Agent ', ' anticarcinogenic ', ' Chemopreventive ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Food Patterns ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Process ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Food ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' Folate ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Intestines ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Physical activity ', ' Leisure Activities ', ' Individual ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Meat ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Nitroso Compounds ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Poverty ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stomach ', ' gastric ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Ascorbic Acid ', ' Vitamin C ', ' VIT C ', ' L-Ascorbic Acid ', ' Vitamin A ', ' Vitamin E ', ' Investigation ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' information gathering ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Sampling ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R03,2009,69470,0.17277077508690772
"Understanding Disparities in Obesity and its Comorbidities in the US    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding Disparities in Obesity and Its Comorbidities in the U.S. Obesity/overweight has become a public health crisis in the U.S., and currently affects 2/3 of adults and 1/3 of children. Obesity can serve as a good indicator of unhealthy lifestyles such as unhealthy diet and inadequate physical activity (PA), two key modifiable risk factors for many chronic diseases including Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension (HBP). National data show large ethnic/SES disparities in obesity, T2D, HBP and healthcare. Obesity is believed as the result of a large number of biological, behavioral, social, environmental and economic factors and the complex interactions between them that promote a positive energy balance. The determinants of these disparities are still poorly understood. Many speculations have been made regarding the major contributors based on a growing body of literature, which has focused largely on individual factors such as SES, body image, and lifestyle factors and in some recent studies regarding selected community characteristics. Our understanding of the relative contribution of these factors, the interplay between them, and the social, economic and environmental context on individual-level behaviors is limited. Our proposed 3-year study is a systematic investigation based on data collected from national surveys, large cohort studies and other sources and aims to understand the causes of ethnic/SES disparities in obesity and its co-morbidities (T2D and HBP) as well as the related health care in the U.S., both adults and children. We will use an interdisciplinary approach to study the determinants at the individual-, family-, and community- level using several sophisticated statistical methods: Aim 1: To study the modifiable determinants of ethnicity/SES disparities in obesity and main co-morbidities. We will study the contributions (in absolute and relative terms) of risk factors at the individual-, family-, and community-level, including psychosocial, behavioral, environmental, economic, and policy factors. Aim 1a: Study the contribution of individual-level (e.g., diet, PA, SES, social support, psychosocial factors), and family-level variables (e.g., SES, participation in food assistance programs, resemblance between parents and their children in diet, PA, and weight status); Aim 1b: Study the contribution of social context factors (e.g., food outlets, fitness facilities, food prices, community characteristics, school PE and recess policies, school food service). Aim 1c: Consider all related factors at multi-levels simultaneously to study their relative contributions. Aim 1d: Using similar approaches study T2D and HBP. Aim 1e: Conduct ecological/ aggregated analysis to study the underlying causes of the disparities at the state and metropolitan statistical area (MSA) levels. Aim 2: To study the influence of primary healthcare on the disparities of obesity and the causes of health care (related to obesity) disparities. Aim 3: To conduct simulation analyses using systems analysis approaches to examine the effects of potential interventions and scenarios for helping eliminate the ethnicity/SES disparities. Findings of this study will help achieve several of the objectives specified in the NIH PAR, and help direct future interventions to eliminate health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed 3-year study is a systematic investigation based on data from national surveys and other sources to understand the individual-, family-, and community-level causes of ethnic/SES disparities in obesity and its co-morbidities including type 2 diabetes and hypertension as well as the related health care in the U.S. using an interdisciplinary approach.           Narrative:  The proposed 3-year study is a systematic investigation based on data from national surveys and other sources to understand the individual-, family-, and community-level causes of ethnic/SES disparities in obesity and its comorbidities including type 2 diabetes and hypertension as well as the related health care in the U.S. using an interdisciplinary approach.",Understanding Disparities in Obesity and its Comorbidities in the US,7690440,R01DK081335,"['System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' cationic antimicrobial protein CAP 37 ', ' heparin-binding protein 37-kDa ', ' Neutrophil Azurocidin ', ' NAZC ', ' Humazur ', ' Heparin Binding Protein ', ' HBP ', ' Cationic Antimicrobial Protein-37 ', ' CAP37 ', ' CAP 37 ', ' Azurocidin 1 (Cationic Antimicrobial Protein 37) ', ' Azurocidin 1 ', ' Azurocidin ', ' AZU1 Protein ', ' AZAMP ', ' 37kd Cationic Antimicrobial Protein ', ' 37-kDa RBP ', ' Equation ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' Cost Benefit Analyses ', ' Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diet ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Dietary intake ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Food Assistance Programs ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Characteristics ', ' Expenditure ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food Services ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Household ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marital Status ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Morbidity -

"EXCESS BMI GAIN DURING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: THE ROLE OF CONTEXTUAL FACTORS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents has been increasing dramatically with low-income and some racial/ethnic minority populations being at highest risk. Rising obesity rates and socioeconomic disparities in obesity stem from social and environmental factors that need to be understood and modified for effective prevention. In this project, we propose to follow a cohort of 20,000 children through elementary school, a period when demographic disparities in obesity manifest themselves, to study their physical development, health behaviors, and the relationship of these outcomes and behaviors to the food and physical activity environments in their residential and school neighborhoods. Our specific aims are as follows: 1. Describe how the food and physical activity environments around residences and schools differ for children from different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 2. Describe how the food and physical activity environments inside elementary schools differ for children from different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 3. Analyze the relationship between food and physical activity environments and health behaviors, by socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 4. Analyze the contribution of food and physical activity environments in the development of disparities in body mass index (BMI) in children from kindergarten through 5th (and for some analyses 8th) grade. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: School and residential environments are likely to shape children's health behaviors, but their contributions to excess weight gain are unknown. This project tries to identify environmental factors of excess weight gain during elementary school years, which includes the age where sociodemographic disparities in overweight begin to manifest themselves. This is a necessary task before considering whether proposed interventions and policy changes are promising or likely to lead down a blind alley.             ",EXCESS BMI GAIN DURING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: THE ROLE OF CONTEXTUAL FACTORS,7527774,R01HD057193,"['Crime ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Study Section ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Food ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Physical activity ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' obesity in children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Policies ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Physical Education ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' kindergarten ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Instruction ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' stem ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Shapes ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Restaurants ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Television ', ' Time ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' elementary school ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' third grade ', ' fifth grade ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' ']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2009,300178,0.13587564255850687
"Food environment, diet quality, and disparities in obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will examine how the physical, social, and economic environments influence dietary choices and, thereby, contribute to disparities in obesity rates. The present hypothesis is that the low cost and easy access to energy-dense foods may be an independent predictor of higher obesity rates. This study will combine survey research techniques with novel methods of spatial analysis to obtain in-depth information about the participants' physical and food environment and their access to food sources. A telephone survey of a stratified sample of 2,000 adult residents of King County, WA, will provide self-reported data on the participants' socioeconomic position (SEP), shopping and eating habits, food expenditures, obesity, and health. All addresses will be geocoded to facilitate spatial analysis and mapping. Objective measures of SEP will be based on data at the most detailed resolution available -- the County tax assessor at the tax parcel level. Objective measures of physical access to three key food sources, defined for each respondent in terms of quality, distance and time, will be calculated at the individual level using custom GIS based applications and novel metrics of the physical environment. Custom programs within GIS software will capture and perform preliminary geometric analysis of geospatial data within the proximity of the survey participants' home environment and their chief food sources. Dietary energy density and monetary cost of individual diets will be estimated using local food prices and an additional diet questionnaire instrument that will be mailed to all 2000 study respondents. Local variation in food prices will be assessed using a market basket technique.

"Obesity Among Older Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last few decades have witnessed a particularly rapid rise in weight and obesity for individuals of all ages. While weight growth in children and working-aged adults has received the most attention, the public health consequences of excess weight for the near-elderly and elderly are considerable. This research will identify the determinants of weight gain in these older populations, and the consequences for health. To guide the research, we will develop a dynamic economic model of weight gain that illustrates the relationships between food prices, exercise availability, income, and weight. The empirical investigation will begin with some descriptive analysis designed to characterize the changing age-profile of weight and weight gain, by socioeconomic status and other demographic characteristics. We then turn to two important economic determinants of weight: food prices and retirement. Previous studies have demonstrated a link between food prices and weight, but the relationship for the elderly is not known, nor is the effect of retirement. We present preliminary evidence that retirement has substantial effects on weight, and that these effects vary with occupational characteristics in theoretically predictable ways. Next, we examine the complex relationships between weight and health. We first propose to study the effect of food pricing and availability on nutritional status, using objectively measured data on blood nutrient levels. This provides insight into the way in which food intake, if properly targeted, can improve health. This leads naturally into an investigation of the causal impact of weight on health. We will use variation in weight generated by food price variation and state-level exemptions of food from sales taxes. We will explore the effect of this variation in weight on health. Finally, we propose policy analyses based on our work. We will investigate the effect of hypothetical food taxation policies on weight, health, and nutrition.         ",Obesity Among Older Americans,8006593,R01AG025743,"['Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economic Models ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Food ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Simulate ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Restaurants ', ' Retirement ', ' Running ', ' Sales ', ' Societies ', ' Nutritional status ', ' Taxation ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Underweight ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Occupational ', ' Physical environment ', ' American ', ' functional status ', ' nutrient blood level ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' simulation ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' health inequalities ', ' population health ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2009,221340,0.1259763806199241

"A taste for tastes?The spread of food choices & health behaviors in networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Can it be said that: ""you are what your friends eat?"" The primary objectives of this research are to: (a) describe patterns of food choice in a bounded population over 20 years; (b) statistically assess relationships between social status and food choice over time; (c) to evaluate the extent to which taste preferences, specifically patterns of food choice, might be observed to spread through this population via social ties. While it is commonly accepted that what we eat affects our well-being, existing research that seeks to specify causal relationships between eating behaviors and health outcomes has largely ignored the role of social connections between networks of individuals. To what extent do our specific food consumption patterns depend on the taste preferences of people to whom we are directly (or indirectly) connected? This research has the potential to help explain variation in health status by allowing for synthesis of data on health outcomes, social ties, and eating behaviors over a 20-year period. Falsifiable hypotheses concerning taste transmission and strength of social ties are generated by insights drawn from sociological research of taste preferences, social networks, inequality, and biological theories of diet, nutrition, and disease. It is hypothesized that patterns of food choice can diffuse through social ties between individuals and influence health. Such evidence would point to a novel, undocumented social component of health. A three-stage analysis is proposed. In the first stage, cluster analysis and individuals' scoring on an index of ""healthy eating"" are used to describe individuals' eating patterns and the degree to which they change diet over time. In the second stage, 1 use individuals' diet patterns, healthy eating index, SES variables, and data from social network ties over time as predictor variables in a series of cross-lagged panel models designed to statistically assess effects on individuals' diets. In the third stage, I use social network methods and visualization techniques to build on the prior longitudinal models, and to statistically assess the extent and speed of diffusion of diet patterns over time. With growing concern for health conditions such as obesity and cardiovascular disease that are highly correlated with our tastes in food, this project has important public health implications. A better understanding of the social mechanisms that underlie these health conditions can point to more effective behavioral interventions to address modifiable risk factors for disease. In sum, this research has the potential to make the public think more critically about not just what, but how, it eats, by uncovering mechanisms by which social norms can change in a given population over time.              ",A taste for tastes?The spread of food choices & health behaviors in networks,7749312,F31AG033503,"['Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Diet ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Ego ', ' Address ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' Diet and Nutrition ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Sum ', ' Food Patterns ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' To specify ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food Preferences ', ' Affect ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Diffuse ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' indexing ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' insight ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Methods ', ' Music ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' Production ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Religion ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Social Distance ', ' Social Mobility ', ' Arts ', ' Taste Perception ', ' Taste ', ' Gustation ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Guideline Adherence ', ' preference ', ' phrases ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Social status ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' theories ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' model design ', ' food consumption ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' modifiable risk ', ' comparative ', ' network models ', ' health inequalities ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,27696,0.1764260904713257
"EXCESS BMI GAIN DURING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: THE ROLE OF CONTEXTUAL FACTORS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents has been increasing dramatically with low-income and some racial/ethnic minority populations being at highest risk. Rising obesity rates and socioeconomic disparities in obesity stem from social and environmental factors that need to be understood and modified for effective prevention. In this project, we propose to follow a cohort of 20,000 children through elementary school, a period when demographic disparities in obesity manifest themselves, to study their physical development, health behaviors, and the relationship of these outcomes and behaviors to the food and physical activity environments in their residential and school neighborhoods. Our specific aims are as follows: 1. Describe how the food and physical activity environments around residences and schools differ for children from different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 2. Describe how the food and physical activity environments inside elementary schools differ for children from different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 3. Analyze the relationship between food and physical activity environments and health behaviors, by socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 4. Analyze the contribution of food and physical activity environments in the development of disparities in body mass index (BMI) in children from kindergarten through 5th (and for some analyses 8th) grade. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: School and residential environments are likely to shape children's health behaviors, but their contributions to excess weight gain are unknown. This project tries to identify environmental factors of excess weight gain during elementary school years, which includes the age where sociodemographic disparities in overweight begin to manifest themselves. This is a necessary task before considering whether proposed interventions and policy changes are promising or likely to lead down a blind alley.

"Evaluating Economic Subsidies To Improve Dietary Intake Among Low Income Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05) Comparative Effectiveness Research and specific Challenge Topic, 05-MD-101: Social Determinants of Health. In an effort to improve dietary intake and address the high prevalence of obesity among low-income children, the US Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) published an interim rule in the Federal Register revising the food packages in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC). WIC provides supplemental food to more than 8 million low-income children women. In response to recommendations from the Institutes of Medicine, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service proposed to align WIC food packages with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Among the revisions are changes in the fat content (e.g., reduced fat milk) and the fiber content (e.g., whole grain bread) of foods approved for purchase with WIC vouchers and the addition of a monthly fruit and vegetable voucher. These proposed changes will go into effect in August 2009. We propose to examine the effect of the revised WIC program on consumption of fruits, vegetables, fiber, and reduced-fat foods by low-income children compared to consumption levels under the current WIC program, and we will examine the individual, interpersonal, and community mechanisms that affect dietary intake over the course of the study. The proposed study is important for several reasons. 1) It provides a rare opportunity to evaluate the impact of a national policy shift in food assistance to support healthy eating in low- income families. This national policy shift has the potential to improve healthful eating and may be particularly important in addressing diet-related health disparities, particularly obesity, among low-income individuals. 2) Policymakers are increasingly expressing interest in the use of economic subsidies to improve dietary intake and health outcomes. From a comparative effectiveness perspective, we will be able to assess whether improving access to healthy food changes food intake and ultimately, weight status. 3) The proposed study will build on a pilot project (Chicago WIC Food Environment Survey) we are currently conducting in collaboration with the Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS), which is responsible for WIC administration in the state, and the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago, the group responsible for WIC distribution in Chicago. The pilot, scheduled for May-July 2009, will provide essential baseline data (0 months) for evaluating the WIC program prior to implementation of the new policy in August 2009. 4) In conjunction with these two agencies, we have the ability to link longitudinal voucher pick-up and voucher redemption data with reported dietary intake, important social contextual variables, and child weight gain trajectory over the first 18 months of the policy (with informed consent). The proposed study will also allow us to create five new positions and retain two current employees that would have been lost due to project completions. The project includes seven FTEs with benefits including a full tuition waiver from the University of Illinois and health insurance benefits for all benefit-eligible employees. This will be particularly appealing to individuals who are seeking further educational opportunities and stable health benefits. Interviewers from the project will gain research skills that will increase their future marketability. The overall purpose of the proposed study is to examine the mechanisms by which economic incentives offered in food assistance program impact dietary intake of children. We are currently collecting pre-policy implementation baseline data (0 months), and the aims of the proposed study are to follow these 300 mother/child dyads, longitudinally, at 6, 12, and 18 months post-policy implementation. Primary Aims 1. To compare fruit and vegetable (FV) intake of children before and at 6, 12, and 18 months following policy implementation. 2. To compare fat and fiber intake of children before and at 6, 12, and 18 months following policy implementation. 3. To examine the individual, interpersonal, and community mechanisms influencing dietary intake before and at 6, 12, and 18 months following policy implementation. Secondary Aims 1. To compare FV intake of mothers before and at 6, 12, and 18 months following policy implementation. 2. To compare fat and fiber intake of mothers before and at 6, 12, and 18 months following policy implementation. Exploratory Aims 1. To compare pick-up and redemption of vouchers before and at 6, 12, and 18 months following policy implementation. 2. To examine weight gain trajectory of 300 preschool children prior to policy implementation through 18 months post policy implementation. In an effort to improve dietary intake and address the high prevalence of obesity among low-income children, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) plans to revise their food packages. The overall purpose of the proposed study is to examine the mechanisms by which economic incentives offered in a large food assistance program impacts dietary intake of children.

"Multiethnic Cohort Study of Diet and Cancer The Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study was designed to prospectively investigate the relationship of diet an other lifestyle factors to cancer risk in five ethnic groups (African Americans, Japanese Americans, Latinos Native Hawaiians and Caucasians),and to explore interactions between these risk factors and geneti susceptibility to cancer. Since establishment of the cohort in 1993-96, more than 10 years of follow-up hav accrued on the 215,000 participants, bringing the project to a point where its full potential can now b realized. In the current cycle of support, we are re-administering the baseline questionnaire to obtai updated (10-year) dietary and other information on the subjects (e.g., smoking, physical activity, hormona usage, medications, intercurrent illnesses). We have been analyzing data from the baseline questionnaire both dietary and non-dietary, as well as data on genetic susceptibility and gene-environment interactions Altogether, we have published 50 papers from the cohort since early 2003. We have been among the mos active participants in NCI's Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium, and have shared our data wit other members of the consortium, as well as with investigators at outside institutions. For the next 5-yea period, we have several dietary scientific aims, including further research into the basis for ethni differences we observed in diet and cancer relationships, investigation of hypotheses related to dietar constituents recently added to our food composition table (e.g., trans fatty acids, heme iron, glycemic load heterocyclic amines), study of some less common sites (e.g., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovary and kidney) more in-depth subgroup analyses (e.g., by histology and stage), and investigations of the relationship of die to cancer survival. We also have several non-dietary scientific aims, particularly related to investigating as yet unexplainable ethnic differences in breast and lung cancer risk. The important work necessary t maintain the cohort and its several databases will continue, including administration of another short follow up questionnaire and regular enhancements to the unique food composition table. Finally, we will continu to train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. We expect this research not only to expand knowledg of the role of environmental risk factors and genes in cancer risk, but also to further an understanding of th basis for ethnic/racial disparities in cancer occurrence and survival.

"Inequities in African American Environmental Contexts for Obesity Prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to PA-08-149, this R13 application requests support for a scientific workshop focusing on social inequities in environmental determinants of obesity in African Americans that can be addressed through community-based participatory research (CBPR). The inequities of interest relate to the well-documented excess availability and promotion of unhealthful vs. more healthful foods and beverages and relative lack of access to safe and affordable options for physical activity in African American communities. This focus directly addresses NIH strategic goals for elimination of racial/ethnic disparities in obesity and cardiovascular diseases. The workshop will be convened under the auspices of the African American Collaborative Obesity Research Network (AACORN). AACORN links scholars, researchers and community-based research partners nationally in efforts to increase the quality, quantity, and effective translation of research to address weight issues in African American communities. The requested support would cover partial costs of a 2 1/2 day national workshop with 100 invited participants. Framing and content will approach the issue of obesity prevention in African American communities through a social justice lens. Objectives are to: 1) obtain a broad overview of how environmental inequities affecting African Americans have been successfully addressed through policy, community action, and social change, on issues other than those directly related to obesity; 2) identify recent or current successes or promising work-in-progress in addressing inequities in the food and activity environments of African Americans; 3) highlight current research documenting and understanding community perceptions of inequities in food and beverage marketing practices and strategies for addressing them; 4) draft a model vision and research/action plan for improving food and physical activity environments of African Americans; and 5) initiate a process for implementing this action plan with national and local African American community stakeholders. This workshop will engage academic scholars and scholars- in-training from public health, nutrition and food studies, exercise science, public policy, community development, marketing, economics, and other fields as well as community partners and policy makers. Building on successes and lessons learned from the three previous AACORN national invited workshops, held in 2004, 2006, and 2008, the Network will utilize a new workshop format in 2010: a dialogical conference model will be implemented in order to prioritize and create spaces for discourse and intellectual exchange. Workshop outcomes will be disseminated through the internet, academic journals, and other channels. Inequities in the availability and promotion of healthful vs. unhealthful foods and beverages and in access to safe and affordable options for physical activity in African American communities are well-documented. These inequities limit the ability to eliminate health disparities related to obesity. A scientific workshop that brings together diverse scholars, community partners, and policy makers can generate research and action strategies to address these inequities.              Project Narrative Inequities in the availability and promotion of healthful vs. unhealthful foods and beverages and in access to safe and affordable options for physical activity in African American communities are well-documented.

"A taste for tastes?The spread of food choices & health behaviors in networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Can it be said that: ""you are what your friends eat?"" The primary objectives of this research are to: (a) describe patterns of food choice in a bounded population over 20 years; (b) statistically assess relationships between social status and food choice over time; (c) to evaluate the extent to which taste preferences, specifically patterns of food choice, might be observed to spread through this population via social ties. While it is commonly accepted that what we eat affects our well-being, existing research that seeks to specify causal relationships between eating behaviors and health outcomes has largely ignored the role of social connections between networks of individuals. To what extent do our specific food consumption patterns depend on the taste preferences of people to whom we are directly (or indirectly) connected? This research has the potential to help explain variation in health status by allowing for synthesis of data on health outcomes, social ties, and eating behaviors over a 20-year period. Falsifiable hypotheses concerning taste transmission and strength of social ties are generated by insights drawn from sociological research of taste preferences, social networks, inequality, and biological theories of diet, nutrition, and disease. It is hypothesized that patterns of food choice can diffuse through social ties between individuals and influence health. Such evidence would point to a novel, undocumented social component of health. A three-stage analysis is proposed. In the first stage, cluster analysis and individuals' scoring on an index of ""healthy eating"" are used to describe individuals' eating patterns and the degree to which they change diet over time. In the second stage, 1 use individuals' diet patterns, healthy eating index, SES variables, and data from social network ties over time as predictor variables in a series of cross-lagged panel models designed to statistically assess effects on individuals' diets. In the third stage, I use social network methods and visualization techniques to build on the prior longitudinal models, and to statistically assess the extent and speed of diffusion of diet patterns over time. With growing concern for health conditions such as obesity and cardiovascular disease that are highly correlated with our tastes in food, this project has important public health implications. A better understanding of the social mechanisms that underlie these health conditions can point to more effective behavioral interventions to address modifiable risk factors for disease. In sum, this research has the potential to make the public think more critically about not just what, but how, it eats, by uncovering mechanisms by which social norms can change in a given population over time.              ",A taste for tastes?The spread of food choices & health behaviors in networks,7970939,F31AG033503,"['Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Diet ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Ego ', ' Address ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' Diet and Nutrition ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Sum ', ' Food Patterns ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' To specify ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food Preferences ', ' Affect ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Diffuse ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' indexing ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' insight ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Methods ', ' Music ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' Production ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Religion ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Social Distance ', ' Social Mobility ', ' Arts ', ' Taste Perception ', ' Taste ', ' Gustation ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Guideline Adherence ', ' preference ', ' phrases ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Social status ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' theories ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' model design ', ' food consumption ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' modifiable risk ', ' comparative ', ' network models ', ' health inequalities ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F31,2010,2115,0.1764260904713257
"Faith, Farming, the Future: A church-based program addressing health disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural Black youth face a future with high rates of chronic disease compounded by limited access to prevention programs and services. As in urban areas, the underlying socio-economic environment of poverty and disempowerment perpetuate health disparities in rural settings, yet the opportunities for employment are few. Ironically, children of farmers who grew up eating homegrown produce often leave their rural homes for urban jobs in fast food restaurants or low wage, high-risk meat processing plants. Getting youth involved in farming is viewed as a way to build a strong work ethic, promote physical and cognitive development, and as a protective factor to keep children from drug and gang involvement. Rebuilding the local food system is an enormous task, but one that may have significant pay off in addressing many health disparities and social determinants. The burgeoning interest in local and sustainable food systems is opening the door for rural economic development and increased access to healthy, affordable food. Because churches remain one of the most viable rural organizations in the Black community, we propose a community-based participatory research effort to explore rebuilding local food economies. We will work collaboratively with four rural Black churches (two intervention and two delayed intervention control), forming a youth action team of church mentors and youth to conduct an assessment of the food system. The results will be used to 1) identify critical challenges to accessing healthy food and physical activity; 2) develop 5 church-based intervention teams using training and experiential learning related to food systems, nutrition, physical activity, entrepreneurship, and empowerment; and 3) use a controlled trial to compare the effects of the church-based intervention on the primary outcome (increased fruit and vegetable consumption), and on the secondary outcomes of attitudes about nutrition, health, food systems and perceived control. This pilot will allow us to determine the expected effect size to inform the sample size needed for a larger study. Our findings will help researchers and the community better understand whether local food systems work can be used as a vehicle to target risk factors (diet) for chronic disease and address broader issues of health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a church-academic partnership to develop and pilot an intervention for North Carolina church- based youth focused on the local food system as a way to promote a healthier diet and physical activity, while building skills that will enable youth to improve their economic well-being. Using rural food systems as a way to target health disparities will benefit both researchers and community partners by helping to better understand whether food systems skill-building can be used to reduce risk factors for chronic disease.           We propose a church-academic partnership to develop and pilot an intervention for North Carolina church- based youth focused on the local food system as a way to promote a healthier diet and physical activity, while building skills that will enable youth to improve their economic well-being.

"Evaluating Economic Subsidies To Improve Dietary Intake Among Low Income Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05) Comparative Effectiveness Research and specific Challenge Topic, 05-MD-101: Social Determinants of Health. In an effort to improve dietary intake and address the high prevalence of obesity among low-income children, the US Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) published an interim rule in the Federal Register revising the food packages in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC). WIC provides supplemental food to more than 8 million low-income children women. In response to recommendations from the Institutes of Medicine, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service proposed to align WIC food packages with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Among the revisions are changes in the fat content (e.g., reduced fat milk) and the fiber content (e.g., whole grain bread) of foods approved for purchase with WIC vouchers and the addition of a monthly fruit and vegetable voucher. These proposed changes will go into effect in August 2009. We propose to examine the effect of the revised WIC program on consumption of fruits, vegetables, fiber, and reduced-fat foods by low-income children compared to consumption levels under the current WIC program, and we will examine the individual, interpersonal, and community mechanisms that affect dietary intake over the course of the study. The proposed study is important for several reasons. 1) It provides a rare opportunity to evaluate the impact of a national policy shift in food assistance to support healthy eating in low- income families. This national policy shift has the potential to improve healthful eating and may be particularly important in addressing diet-related health disparities, particularly obesity, among low-income individuals. 2) Policymakers are increasingly expressing interest in the use of economic subsidies to improve dietary intake and health outcomes. From a comparative effectiveness perspective, we will be able to assess whether improving access to healthy food changes food intake and ultimately, weight status. 3) The proposed study will build on a pilot project (Chicago WIC Food Environment Survey) we are currently conducting in collaboration with the Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS), which is responsible for WIC administration in the state, and the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago, the group responsible for WIC distribution in Chicago. The pilot, scheduled for May-July 2009, will provide essential baseline data (0 months) for evaluating the WIC program prior to implementation of the new policy in August 2009. 4) In conjunction with these two agencies, we have the ability to link longitudinal voucher pick-up and voucher redemption data with reported dietary intake, important social contextual variables, and child weight gain trajectory over the first 18 months of the policy (with informed consent). The proposed study will also allow us to create five new positions and retain two current employees that would have been lost due to project completions. The project includes seven FTEs with benefits including a full tuition waiver from the University of Illinois and health insurance benefits for all benefit-eligible employees. This will be particularly appealing to individuals who are seeking further educational opportunities and stable health benefits. Interviewers from the project will gain research skills that will increase their future marketability. The overall purpose of the proposed study is to examine the mechanisms by which economic incentives offered in food assistance program impact dietary intake of children. We are currently collecting pre-policy implementation baseline data (0 months), and the aims of the proposed study are to follow these 300 mother/child dyads, longitudinally, at 6, 12, and 18 months post-policy implementation. Primary Aims 1. To compare fruit and vegetable (FV) intake of children before and at 6, 12, and 18 months following policy implementation. 2. To compare fat and fiber intake of children before and at 6, 12, and 18 months following policy implementation. 3. To examine the individual, interpersonal, and community mechanisms influencing dietary intake before and at 6, 12, and 18 months following policy implementation. Secondary Aims 1. To compare FV intake of mothers before and at 6, 12, and 18 months following policy implementation. 2. To compare fat and fiber intake of mothers before and at 6, 12, and 18 months following policy implementation. Exploratory Aims 1. To compare pick-up and redemption of vouchers before and at 6, 12, and 18 months following policy implementation. 2. To examine weight gain trajectory of 300 preschool children prior to policy implementation through 18 months post policy implementation. In an effort to improve dietary intake and address the high prevalence of obesity among low-income children, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) plans to revise their food packages. The overall purpose of the proposed study is to examine the mechanisms by which economic incentives offered in a large food assistance program impacts dietary intake of children. If the planned economic incentives produce improved dietary intake and altered weight gain trajectory among these high-risk children, this could have profound implications for heath disparities in this population.               In an effort to improve dietary intake and address the high prevalence of obesity among low-income children, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) plans to revise their food packages.

"Food environment, diet quality, and disparities in obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will examine how the physical, social, and economic environments influence dietary choices and, thereby, contribute to disparities in obesity rates. The present hypothesis is that the low cost and easy access to energy-dense foods may be an independent predictor of higher obesity rates. This study will combine survey research techniques with novel methods of spatial analysis to obtain in-depth information about the participants' physical and food environment and their access to food sources. A telephone survey of a stratified sample of 2,000 adult residents of King County, WA, will provide self-reported data on the participants' socioeconomic position (SEP), shopping and eating habits, food expenditures, obesity, and health. All addresses will be geocoded to facilitate spatial analysis and mapping. Objective measures of SEP will be based on data at the most detailed resolution available -- the County tax assessor at the tax parcel level. Objective measures of physical access to three key food sources, defined for each respondent in terms of quality, distance and time, will be calculated at the individual level using custom GIS based applications and novel metrics of the physical environment. Custom programs within GIS software will capture and perform preliminary geometric analysis of geospatial data within the proximity of the survey participants' home environment and their chief food sources.

"Understanding Disparities in Obesity and its Comorbidities in the US    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding Disparities in Obesity and Its Comorbidities in the U.S. Obesity/overweight has become a public health crisis in the U.S., and currently affects 2/3 of adults and 1/3 of children. Obesity can serve as a good indicator of unhealthy lifestyles such as unhealthy diet and inadequate physical activity (PA), two key modifiable risk factors for many chronic diseases including Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension (HBP). National data show large ethnic/SES disparities in obesity, T2D, HBP and healthcare. Obesity is believed as the result of a large number of biological, behavioral, social, environmental and economic factors and the complex interactions between them that promote a positive energy balance. The determinants of these disparities are still poorly understood. Many speculations have been made regarding the major contributors based on a growing body of literature, which has focused largely on individual factors such as SES, body image, and lifestyle factors and in some recent studies regarding selected community characteristics. Our understanding of the relative contribution of these factors, the interplay between them, and the social, economic and environmental context on individual-level behaviors is limited. Our proposed 3-year study is a systematic investigation based on data collected from national surveys, large cohort studies and other sources and aims to understand the causes of ethnic/SES disparities in obesity and its co-morbidities (T2D and HBP) as well as the related health care in the U.S., both adults and children. We will use an interdisciplinary approach to study the determinants at the individual-, family-, and community- level using several sophisticated statistical methods: Aim 1: To study the modifiable determinants of ethnicity/SES disparities in obesity and main co-morbidities. We will study the contributions (in absolute and relative terms) of risk factors at the individual-, family-, and community-level, including psychosocial, behavioral, environmental, economic, and policy factors. Aim 1a: Study the contribution of individual-level (e.g., diet, PA, SES, social support, psychosocial factors), and family-level variables (e.g., SES, participation in food assistance programs, resemblance between parents and their children in diet, PA, and weight status); Aim 1b: Study the contribution of social context factors (e.g., food outlets, fitness facilities, food prices, community characteristics, school PE and recess policies, school food service). Aim 1c: Consider all related factors at multi-levels simultaneously to study their relative contributions. Aim 1d: Using similar approaches study T2D and HBP. Aim 1e: Conduct ecological/ aggregated analysis to study the underlying causes of the disparities at the state and metropolitan statistical area (MSA) levels. Aim 2: To study the influence of primary healthcare on the disparities of obesity and the causes of health care (related to obesity) disparities. Aim 3: To conduct simulation analyses using systems analysis approaches to examine the effects of potential interventions and scenarios for helping eliminate the ethnicity/SES disparities. Findings of this study will help achieve several of the objectives specified in the NIH PAR, and help direct future interventions to eliminate health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed 3-year study is a systematic investigation based on data from national surveys and other sources to understand the individual-, family-, and community-level causes of ethnic/SES disparities in obesity and its co-morbidities including type 2 diabetes and hypertension as well as the related health care in the U.S. using an interdisciplinary approach.           Narrative:  The proposed 3-year study is a systematic investigation based on data from national surveys and other sources to understand the individual-, family-, and community-level causes of ethnic/SES disparities in obesity and its comorbidities including type 2 diabetes and hypertension as well as the related health care in the U.S. using an interdisciplinary approach.",Understanding

"Obesity and Metabolic Risk Disparities: Underlying Food Environment Factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While a major focus of disparities research has been on understanding patterns of health determinants and outcomes by race-ethnic and SES subpopulations, there are major gaps in understanding how to use public policy to reduce these gaps. The proposed project examines food prices and food environment factors, two areas with great potential for policy change. We will use longitudinal data to understand the effects of changes in food prices, and availability and access to away-from-home food eateries and food shopping options on diet, and in turn, weight gain and metabolic risk factors. We will finalize a longitudinal data set that geographically and temporally links food price and food environment measures to residential locations of respondents of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a study of the antecedents and risk factors for cardiovascular disease in an ethnicity-, age-, and sex-balanced cohort of 5,115 black and white young adults aged 18-30 years at baseline (1985-86) and followed over 25 years into 2010-11. We capitalize upon neighborhood-level data linked to individual data using a multidisciplinary approach melding spatial analysis methodologies with traditional epidemiological and economic methods. We examine how food prices and neighborhood food and social environmental factors interact with individual-level household income and education to affect the adoption and maintenance of overall measures of beverage and diet quality. Furthermore, we will examine the effect of these behaviors on change in weight and metabolic risk factors (e.g., fasting glucose, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL and HDL cholesterol) over 25 years. We specifically examine how these relationships differ by individual-level race/ethnicity, income, and education. The proposed study builds on work we have done to create a CARDIA neighborhood-level dataset consisting of price and economic data for Exam Years 1-20 and a food environment dataset for years 1-15 (we currently do not have food environment data for year 20). Specific aims include: 1) Add identical food environment data for Year 20 (2005-06) when we will have the third wave of individual-level dietary data; 2) Create and implement a full structural equations model with a specific focus on comparisons within race-ethnicity (black versus white), income (high versus low), education (high versus low) to jointly examine the temporal impact of economic and food environment factors on: (a) individual-level beverage intake and overall diet quality, (b) patterns of weight maintenance and gain, and (c) the incidence, persistence, and reversal on the above metabolic risk factors (controlling for residential choice, pregnancy and marriage status, physical activity and smoking). Using this full system we will be able to examine the full set of relationships between food prices and food environment factors with diet, weight and metabolic risk factors. Our overall impact is to identify economic and food environment factors that are associated with health and can be addressed as potential targets for intervention to reduce disparities in obesity and metabolic risk.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use longitudinal data to examine the full set of relationships between food prices and food environment factors with diet, weight and metabolic risk factors.

"Dietary Intake Patterns of N-Nitroso Compounds    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a formative step towards assessing dietary intake of N-Nitroso compounds in populations to inform subsequent epidemiological investigations and dietary methodology. Lung, stomach, upper gastro-intestinal tract, pancreatic, colorectal, and brain cancers are leading causes of cancer morbidity and death. Mutagenic/carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds in foods have been described in the etiology of these cancers. In order to make a major impact on these cancers, a better understanding of novel dietary preventive strategies is essential. For example processed and preserved meats have a positive association with increased risk of cancer. However, investigations pursing estimates of N-nitroso intakes have been impeded by the lack of a database that summarized N-nitroso food values, and the food patterns driving their intake is unknown across the US population, among subgroups who are at risk for cancer. Lack of such knowledge is an important problem, because, without it, we are unable to fully identify the carcinogenic role of dietary N-nitroso compounds and to make public health recommendations to reduce their intake. To fulfill the gap, we recently developed a dietary database of N-nitroso compounds. The current project will take advantage of the existing N-Nitroso database and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 to validate and measure N-Nitroso compound intake in the total population and by subgroups (race/ethnicity, age group, BMI, income, and leisure activity). We will further explore the interaction of N-nitroso compounds and antioxidants, and the major food contributors of N-nitroso compounds according to population subgroups. The central hypothesis is that high dietary intake of N- Nitroso compounds alone and in interaction with other nutrients vary by subgroups. Using NHANES 2003-2004 dietary, demographic, and other variables in 5280 adults, our existing database of N-nitroso compound values will be linked to foods reported in two 24-hour dietary recalls per sample person. The main effects of the variables and their interactions will be examined by using the new NCI Method of estimating dietary intakes of compounds and foods with programs adapted for NHANES datasets. The proposed study is innovative because it will result in adapting dietary methodology for N-nitroso estimates, and combine existing resources of a N-nitroso dietary database, together with the dietary, demographic, and clinical data from a large national dataset. Information gathered from this study will be valuable in generating novel dietary related hypotheses for cancer case-control studies, and to identify foods and questions for improving dietary methodology specific for N-Nitroso assessment.              The results of this study will help in designing new strategies to target dietary attributes associated with N-nitroso intake by ethnic/racial subgroups and by lifestyle factors, and will address how diet contributes to cancer disparity among these groups. Findings from this study will also provide knowledge on food contributors and dietary patterns of N-nitroso intakes which can improve food frequency questionnaires used in cancer epidemiological studies.",Dietary Intake Patterns of N-Nitroso Compounds,7858412,R03CA135677,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diet ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Intake ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Primary Cancer Prevention ', ' Chemopreventive Agent ', ' anticarcinogenic ', ' Chemopreventive ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Food Patterns ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Process ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Food ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' Folate ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Intestines ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Physical activity ', ' Leisure Activities ', ' Individual ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Meat ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Nitroso Compounds ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Poverty ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stomach ', ' gastric ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Ascorbic Acid ', ' Vitamin C ', ' VIT C ', ' L-Ascorbic Acid ', ' Vitamin A ', ' Vitamin E ', ' Investigation ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' information gathering ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Sampling ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R03,2010,69500,0.17277077508690772
"Building capacity in food bank organizations for obesity prevention programs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a serious public health problem in the United States and increases risk for cancer and other chronic diseases. Obesity as well as cancer rates are high for poor, low-income, Hispanic, and African- American populations, compared with Caucasians and individuals from higher-income families. Reducing obesity can play an important role in reducing these disparities in cancer and chronic disease rates. Innovative intervention strategies are needed to reduce this gap in obesity prevalence between the low-income underserved population and higher-income groups. Many low income families depend on food banks to supply foods each month. Food banks, therefore, are potential existing channels to reach low-income individuals, who are at higher risk for obesity and obesity-related diseases, with health education messages. However, very little has been done to explore this opportunity. The HFB provides food assistance to approximately 500,000 low-income individuals annually (24 percent of individuals served in TX) with the help of its 400 community based agencies (churches, food pantries, and community kitchens). A goal of the HFB is to impact client health behaviors related to weight. However, effective and acceptable methods and strategies to accomplish this goal are unknown, and are of great interest to the HFB. Our proposed study represents a model initiative in which the HFB, its agencies, and the Children's Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) collaborate and coordinate efforts to build the capacity within the HFB system, to provide nutrition education for obesity prevention as well as cancer and other chronic disease risk reduction. This innovative and highly significant R21 application will investigate the potential of food banks to integrate nutrition education into their usual operations using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles. This innovative study will provide data that will enable us to establish effect sizes, sample size, as well as a successful intervention for obesity prevention, and reduction of cancer and other chronic disease risks, using a food bank setting for a future R01, that will include large scale randomized control trial of the intervention(s).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The HFB and other food banks in the United States provide an untapped channel to reach a large number of low-income underserved at-risk populations, and improve their dietary behaviors associated with cancer prevention. The proposed collaborative research and training activities seek to develop an intervention in obesity prevention/reduction in order to reduce cancer risks due to energy imbalance/obesity among low- income food insecure individuals using this untapped channel.             Relevance:  The HFB and other food banks in the United States provide an untapped channel to reach a large number of low-income underserved at-risk populations, and improve their dietary behaviors associated with cancer prevention.

"El Valor de Nuestra Salud (The Value of Our Health)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary intake is an important determinant of risk for obesity and cancer. Consumption of fruits and vegetables reduces risk, yet among Latinos, there is now clear evidence that fruit and vegetable consumption decreases with greater acculturation to the U.S. Interventions targeted at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels of the Socio-Ecological Framework have resulted in changes to dietary intake. However, these studies have neglected to consider that unless changes occur at higher levels of influence (e.g., in stores, in restaurants), individual behavior changes are unlikely to be reinforced and sustained. We propose to refine a pilot-tested intervention to change the food environment of grocery stores to promote consumption of fruits and vegetables. El Valor de Nuestra Salud [The Value of Our Health] will identify, recruit, and match 18 grocery stores (specifically small-to-medium sized Latino grocery stores or tiendas) and randomize them into one of two conditions: intervention versus a no-treatment control condition. The intervention will consist of two communication change strategies and two structural change strategies with the goal of changing aspects of the social and physical environments. The intervention will include employee and manager trainings to promote sales of fruits and vegetables and how to conduct a food marketing campaign. In addition, we will provide equipment and other material resources to the tiendas to promote sales of ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables, and to work with them to modify selections available in the meat and ready-to-eat food departments. Efficacy will be evaluated at the store customer level in terms of baseline to immediate post-intervention (6 months post-baseline) changes in self-reported fruit and vegetable intake in a sample of 360 adult store customers, and maintenance of these changes at the 6-month follow-up (12 months post-baseline). Levels of serum carotenoids collected in a 25% subsample of customers will provide evidence for the validity of dietary self- report. Intervention effectiveness will be evaluated at the employee, manager, and store levels using both self-reported and observed methodological approaches. The RE-AIM framework will be used to assess the potential for disseminating the intervention if it results in improvements in customers' dietary intake.

"EXCESS BMI GAIN DURING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: THE ROLE OF CONTEXTUAL FACTORS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents has been increasing dramatically with low-income and some racial/ethnic minority populations being at highest risk. Rising obesity rates and socioeconomic disparities in obesity stem from social and environmental factors that need to be understood and modified for effective prevention. In this project, we propose to follow a cohort of 20,000 children through elementary school, a period when demographic disparities in obesity manifest themselves, to study their physical development, health behaviors, and the relationship of these outcomes and behaviors to the food and physical activity environments in their residential and school neighborhoods. Our specific aims are as follows: 1. Describe how the food and physical activity environments around residences and schools differ for children from different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 2. Describe how the food and physical activity environments inside elementary schools differ for children from different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 3. Analyze the relationship between food and physical activity environments and health behaviors, by socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 4. Analyze the contribution of food and physical activity environments in the development of disparities in body mass index (BMI) in children from kindergarten through 5th (and for some analyses 8th) grade. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: School and residential environments are likely to shape children's health behaviors, but their contributions to excess weight gain are unknown. This project tries to identify environmental factors of excess weight gain during elementary school years, which includes the age where sociodemographic disparities in overweight begin to manifest themselves. This is a necessary task before considering whether proposed interventions and policy changes are promising or likely to lead down a blind alley.             ",EXCESS BMI GAIN DURING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: THE ROLE OF CONTEXTUAL FACTORS,7725821,R01HD057193,"['Crime ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Study Section ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Food ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Physical activity ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' obesity in children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Policies ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Physical Education ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Restaurants ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Television ', ' Time ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' elementary school ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' third grade ', ' fifth grade ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' kindergarten ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Instruction ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' stem ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2010,306449,0.13587564255850687
"Accounting for the social gradient in diet quality and health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of the relation between diet quality and diet cost among different strata of the US population has been made possible, for the first time, by the release of the national food price database by the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) in May 2008. The prices were for foods consumed by the participants in the representative population-based 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The NHANES data include a 24-hour dietary recall, a medical examination and completed detailed demographic and health questionnaires. Linking the food price vector ($/100g) with the national Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS 1.0) will allow for the estimation of the monetary value of the diet ($/day and $/2000kcal) at the individual-level, in parallel with the estimation of dietary exposure variables commonly used in studies of diet-disease associations. Being able to link diet costs with the NHANES dietary, demographic, socioeconomic and biomarker data for 5,411 US adults (agee20) will permit a rare first look at the intermediate mechanisms in the model framework that links socioeconomic position (SEP) and health outcomes. Energy and nutrient intakes will be used to calculate energy density and nutrient density of each respondent's diet. The new measure of energy-adjusted diet cost may help explain the observed social gradient in obesity, type II diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Analyses will identify SEP predictors of dietary energy density, diet quality and energy-adjusted diet cost and will elucidate the relations among them, something that has never been done in a large-scale representative sample of US adults. The primary hypothesis is that diet quality and cost will be inversely linked; however the nature of that relation will differ by gender, race/ethnicity and SEP strata. The second series of analyses will provide descriptive data on diet quality and cost for subgroups of interest, including high-risk and vulnerable subgroups of the US population, including food assistance recipients or individuals with established chronic disease. Within the limitations of a cross-sectional study, analyses will explore the relation between diet quality measures, diet cost and health outcomes, including measured body mass index (BMI), biomarkers of inflammation, individual components of the metabolic syndrome (e.g., diabetes, abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, prothrombosis and inflammation), the metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Many of those have been linked to specific components of the diet. The hypothesis is that some of the observed associations between dietary components and health will be attenuated once energy-adjusted diet costs are included in the model. The proposed studies offer a unique first look at the cost of healthful and unhealthful diets in the US and the consequences of food pricing on health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The purpose of this research is to assess the relationship between the cost and quality of diets consumed by groups differing in socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. The study is made possible by new data on national food prices that will be merged with a population-based dietary intake survey. This work addresses economic barriers to nutritious diets and thus provides a vital part of the research on socio-economic disparities in health. The long term goal of this research is to establish a new approach to estimating diet cost that links directly to estimates of nutrient intake. The approach will allow investigators to assess food cost as a factor influencing the dietary behaviors of individuals and large populations.              Project Narrative The purpose of this research is to assess the relationship between the cost and quality of diets consumed by groups differing in socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.

"Self-Regulation as a Biological Mechanism for Excess Weight Gain in Toddlers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor biobehavioral self-regulation likely contributes to a number of unhealthy behaviors as individuals seek and consume substances that improve self-regulation at a neurobiological level. Poor self-regulation begins very early in the lifespan, at a time when food is the only accessible substance with biological properties that aid the individual's ability to self-regulate. Children with poor self-regulation may therefore be more likely to tantrum for food, overeat and become overweight. There have been no studies to date integrating knowledge of biobehavioral self-regulation with eating behavior, dietary intake and weight status in early childhood. The study team was awarded a Challenge Grant in 2009 to examine some of these associations in low-income 3- to 5-year-olds, and the preliminary results of this project already demonstrate robust associations between aberrant diurnal salivary cortisol patterns, food-related tantrums, and overweight, beginning at age 36 months. In this low-income population, 40 percent of the children are already overweight by age 36 months, and a significant increase in overweight prevalence seems to occur around age 24 months. This application, therefore, proposes to collect measures of salivary cortisol and alpha amylase, self-regulation, eating behavior, diet, and anthropometry from 250 low-income children longitudinally at ages 21, 27, and 33 months. The study will provide more in-depth measures of these constructs from a younger cohort than has ever previously been studied, and in the low-income demographic that is at very high risk for both poor biobehavioral self-regulation and obesity. Structural equation modeling will be used to examine these potential associations. The aims are to examine, among low-income toddlers longitudinally: (1) the relative contributions of food-related self-regulation, non-food related self-regulation, and salivary cortisol and alpha amylase to preference for comfort foods, emotional eating behavior, and weight status, and to determine if these relationships differ across ages 21, 27, and 33 months; (2) relationships between biobehavioral markers of self-regulation at 21 months with changes in weight status between 21 and 33 months, mediated by preference for comfort foods and emotional eating; (3) trajectories of the development of behavioral self-regulation, and to determine if these trajectories are associated with differences in preference for comfort foods, emotional eating behavior, and weight status at 33 months, independent of physiological markers of self-regulation at baseline. The results of this study will have implications for understanding biobehavioral mechanisms of excessive weight gain in toddlerhood, and thereby potentially contribute to more effective, novel, targeted prevention approaches. The results will also improve the understanding of contributors to health disparities based on socioeconomic status and may also have broad implications for the prevention of a wide range of unhealthy behaviors associated with difficulties with biobehavioral self-regulation.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor biobehavioral self-regulation is believed to contribute to a number of unhealthy behaviors, including overeating and the development of obesity. Improved understanding of the development of associations between biobehavioral self-regulation, eating behavior, and excessive weight gain beginning in the toddler years may hold promise for novel targets for obesity prevention. Given that obesity and struggles with biobehavioral self-regulation are both more common among low-income children, the work may also hold particular promise for addressing socioeconomic disparities in obesity prevalence. In addition, overeating in toddlerhood may provide an important and unprecedented model for the early development of biobehavioral self-regulation contributing to a range of unhealthy behaviors. The results could therefore be broadly applicable to more effective prevention of other unhealthy behaviors such as substance abuse.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Poor biobehavioral self-regulation is believed to contribute to a number of unhealthy behaviors, including overeating and the development of obesity.

"New Mexico Center for Advancement of Research, Engagement, & Science on Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though much evidence exists of persistent environmental health disparities within minority and other marginalized populations, the real challenge lies ahead-to develop, implement, and sustain effective intervention strategies to reduce health disparities in these diverse populations, be they policy, clinical, social, or behaviorally based. Researchers at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center (UNM HSC) have a long history of working with policy makers and community groups on environmental health (EH) issues. However, the infrastructure to research and fill information gaps to inform interventions does not exist. The efforts proposed by the Environmental Health Core (EHC), in collaboration with other components of the New Mexico Center for Advancement of Research, Engagement & Science on Health Disparities (NM CARES HD) establishes an intervention research agenda to reduce EH disparities based on sound research practices and informed by community needs. Our specific aims are designed to achieve this goal. Aim 1: To build on and expand existing relationships between communities, policy makers, researchers and clinicians to identify and address gaps in our understanding of EH disparities and develop an intervention science research focus in EH disparities. Aim 2: Initiate two new community partnership-based research projects, focused on interventions to reduce EH disparities. Project 1, Fiestas: Improving Food Security in an Urban Hispanic Community, will develop and pilot a collaborative community-based intervention to improve the social and food environment in an urban, food desert community with marked health disparities. Project 2, Zinc Reversal of Uranium Toxicity: Potential for Community-Based Intervention, responds to community concerns by testing a mechanism-based intervention to reverse the effects of uranium through use of zinc supplements in a prenatal cohort. Aim 3: Mentor minority trainees to develop and expand EH disparities research. We propose a vigorous, self-sustaining EHC to advance the scientific base of knowledge about interventions and solutions to socioeconomic, natural, chemical, and built environment issues contributing to the EH disparities faced by Native Americans and Hispanic communities in New Mexico. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The EHC will advance EH equity knowledge and interventions that are scientifically-based, culturally centered and community-partnered. The Core will focus principally on reducing health disparities among NM's large and diverse Hispanic and Native American populations. The state's poverty, poor measures of health status, and evidence of persistent EH disparities emphasize the importance of this focus.","New Mexico Center for Advancement of Research, Engagement, & Science on Health",8312849,P20MD004811,"['lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Mentors ', ' New Mexico ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Solutions ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' U element ', ' Uranium ', ' Work ', ' Zn element ', ' Zinc ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Native Americans ', ' weapons ', ' Knowledge ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' food security ', ' Population ', ' minority trainee ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,P20,2011,528500,0.06701063591267666
"Neural Correlates of Food Reward in American Indian Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 award will allow Dr. Beckman, the first American Indian (AI) adult endocrinologist in the nation, to become an investigator proficient in interdisciplinary research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the causes of obesity. She has a career interest in the neuropsychology of obesity and diabetes and her focus is on the AI population in Minnesota. Obesity is a major health disparity in AIs, yet litle work is being done to unravel the neurobiology of this problem. The training and research activities will allow her to examine the complexities of computational neuroscience, functional neuroanatomy, and the contribution of opioidergic neurons to brain reward pathways. The application proposes an intensive, 5-year program of mentored research and formal training activities to enhance Dr. Beckman's skills and experience in: 1) clinical research methods and biostatistics, 2) technical aspects of fMRI data acquisition and analysis, and 3) role of opioidergic neurons in the neuroendocrine regulation of appetite. In the long term, Dr. Beckman will apply these translational research skills to study neuromodulation, cognitive restructuring, and opioid antagonists as potentially effective treatments for the public health problem of obesity in her AI patients who may be hyperresponsive to environmentally rewarding food cues.  The research component of this career development award targets the neurobiology of behavioral responses to food in 60 AIs. The specific aims are to: 1) use fMRI to compare brain activation associated with the response to visual food cues in obese versus lean AI women, 2) use fMRI to compare the effects of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, versus placebo, on brain activation associated with response to palatable food cues, 3) compare the effects of naltrexone versus placebo on food intake in obese and lean AI women, by measuring calories consumed.  The University of Minnesota is an exceptional environment for Dr. Beckman to gain the skills needed to achieve her goals. The training component uses academic resources including the Division of Diabetes, Metabolism, and Endocrinology, Minnesota Obesity Center, Center for the Study of Impulsivity in Addiction, Center for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Clinical and Translational Science Institute. Dr. Beckman's mentors are highly regarded scientists in the areas of obesity, addiction, and neuroimaging.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the disproportionate obesity burden among AIs, this will be the first study using fMRI and an opioid antagonist to focus on this underrepresented population. Our results will provide important data about brain activation in response to high-calorie foods that will inform dietary interventions aimed at preventing and treating obesity and may identify a promising pharmacologic treatment for obesity and overeating in AIs.              Despite the disproportionate obesity burden among AIs, this will be the first study using fMRI and an opioid antagonist to focus on this underrepresented population.

"Food Environment, Diet Quality and Disparities in Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle Obesity Study (S.O.S) seeks to explain why obesity rates are more prevalent among some racial/ethnic minorities, population subgroups of lower education and incomes, and in high-poverty areas. The study will recruit a longitudinal cohort of 400 male and female adults, ages 21-65y, and resident in Seattle-King County and stratified by income and race/ethnicity, using an address-based sampling scheme. Data on food seeking behavior will be collected using a combination of self report and objective measures. At the first in- person interview, participants will complete a behavior survey module on food shopping and dietary habits, estimated food expenditures, nutrition literacy, attitudes towards diet and health, demographics, and health status. Health-related questions will address obesity, diabetes, stress, and cardiovascular disease. Height, weight, and waist circumference will be measured. A GPS receiver with data logging capability will be used to track the participants' movements and to record the time and location of all food-related events for 1 wk. Food store and restaurant receipts, stamped with time and date, will be collected for 4 wks. Foods brought into the home will be scanned with a portable UPC scanner for 4 wks. Three 24-h food recalls will be administered by phone in wks 3 and 4, and food frequency questionnaires will be administered in week 4 of data collection. To be able to establish causality between environmental and dietary variables and health outcomes, the behavior survey module and the food frequency questionnaire will be re-administered during a follow up visit 18 months later and anthropometric measures will be collected for the second time. Data on foods purchased for use at home and foods consumed away from home will be linked to individual-level metrics of the built environment based on tax parcel data. The main aim of the study is to assess the impact of SEP, environmental, and dietary variables on obesity and body weight gain. The hypothesis is that low dietary quality and low diet cost will be associated with prevalent obesity and will predict 18 mo. weight gain, adjusting for SEP. This model will be built on data collected and validated under Aims 2 and 3. The second aim will be to assess how access to food sources (both physical and economic), retail outlet choice, and food purchases impact diet quality across SEP strata. The hypothesis is that diet quality will be influenced strongly by price and other economic variables than by proximity to food sources. The third aim will be to validate self-reported data on food acquisition and expenditures against objective measures of individual behavior in space and time. The hypothesis is that objective measures of food purchase behaviors based on GPS logs, food store and restaurant receipts, and UPC scanner data will provide new insights into the energy and nutrient content of foods that are acquired at different locations. Study results have the potential of informing local and national policies on improving retail access to affordable healthy foods by vulnerable groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A better understanding of factors that may explain social disparities in diet quality and chronic diseases is critical. The proposed longitudinal study seeks to explain the role of built environment, economics, psychosocial factors, SEP and demographics on food seeking behaviors, diet quality, obesity and body weight gain. This interdisciplinary project on the built environment, behavior and health brings together experts from nutrition, geography, epidemiology, medicine, statistics and urban design.           A better understanding of factors that may explain social disparities in diet quality and chronic diseases is critical.

"EXCESS BMI GAIN DURING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: THE ROLE OF CONTEXTUAL FACTORS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents has been increasing dramatically with low-income and some racial/ethnic minority populations being at highest risk. Rising obesity rates and socioeconomic disparities in obesity stem from social and environmental factors that need to be understood and modified for effective prevention. In this project, we propose to follow a cohort of 20,000 children through elementary school, a period when demographic disparities in obesity manifest themselves, to study their physical development, health behaviors, and the relationship of these outcomes and behaviors to the food and physical activity environments in their residential and school neighborhoods. Our specific aims are as follows: 1. Describe how the food and physical activity environments around residences and schools differ for children from different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 2. Describe how the food and physical activity environments inside elementary schools differ for children from different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 3. Analyze the relationship between food and physical activity environments and health behaviors, by socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 4. Analyze the contribution of food and physical activity environments in the development of disparities in body mass index (BMI) in children from kindergarten through 5th (and for some analyses 8th) grade. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: School and residential environments are likely to shape children's health behaviors, but their contributions to excess weight gain are unknown. This project tries to identify environmental factors of excess weight gain during elementary school years, which includes the age where sociodemographic disparities in overweight begin to manifest themselves. This is a necessary task before considering whether proposed interventions and policy changes are promising or likely to lead down a blind alley.             ",EXCESS BMI GAIN DURING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: THE ROLE OF CONTEXTUAL FACTORS,7995989,R01HD057193,"['blind ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' obesity in children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' early childhood ', ' Physical Education ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' girls ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' third grade ', ' fifth grade ', ' residence ', ' Ethnic group ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Study Section ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Low income ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Television ', ' Economics ', ' Instruction ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Restaurants ', ' stem ', ' Safety ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Gender ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Consumption ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' social ', ' Prevalence ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Crime ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' trend ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Minority ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Health behavior ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' boys ', ' Outcome ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Data ', ' Schools ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Clinical ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Health ', ' Play ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Affect ', ' Staging ', ' Address ', ' Age ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Shapes ', ' Diet ', ' Environment ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Policies ', ' Time ', ' high risk ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' kindergarten ', ' Prevention ', ' Chronic ', ' Physical activity ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' cohort ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' elementary school ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Weight ', ' Food ', ' ']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2011,252699,0.13587564255850687
"Self-Regulation as a Biological Mechanism for Excess Weight Gain in Toddlers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor biobehavioral self-regulation likely contributes to a number of unhealthy behaviors as individuals seek and consume substances that improve self-regulation at a neurobiological level. Poor self-regulation begins very early in the lifespan, at a time when food is the only accessible substance with biological properties that aid the individual's ability to self-regulate. Children with poor self-regulation may therefore be more likely to tantrum for food, overeat and become overweight. There have been no studies to date integrating knowledge of biobehavioral self-regulation with eating behavior, dietary intake and weight status in early childhood. The study team was awarded a Challenge Grant in 2009 to examine some of these associations in low-income 3- to 5-year-olds, and the preliminary results of this project already demonstrate robust associations between aberrant diurnal salivary cortisol patterns, food-related tantrums, and overweight, beginning at age 36 months. In this low-income population, 40 percent of the children are already overweight by age 36 months, and a significant increase in overweight prevalence seems to occur around age 24 months. This application, therefore, proposes to collect measures of salivary cortisol and alpha amylase, self-regulation, eating behavior, diet, and anthropometry from 250 low-income children longitudinally at ages 21, 27, and 33 months. The study will provide more in-depth measures of these constructs from a younger cohort than has ever previously been studied, and in the low-income demographic that is at very high risk for both poor biobehavioral self-regulation and obesity. Structural equation modeling will be used to examine these potential associations. The aims are to examine, among low-income toddlers longitudinally: (1) the relative contributions of food-related self-regulation, non-food related self-regulation, and salivary cortisol and alpha amylase to preference for comfort foods, emotional eating behavior, and weight status, and to determine if these relationships differ across ages 21, 27, and 33 months; (2) relationships between biobehavioral markers of self-regulation at 21 months with changes in weight status between 21 and 33 months, mediated by preference for comfort foods and emotional eating; (3) trajectories of the development of behavioral self-regulation, and to determine if these trajectories are associated with differences in preference for comfort foods, emotional eating behavior, and weight status at 33 months, independent of physiological markers of self-regulation at baseline. The results of this study will have implications for understanding biobehavioral mechanisms of excessive weight gain in toddlerhood, and thereby potentially contribute to more effective, novel, targeted prevention approaches. The results will also improve the understanding of contributors to health disparities based on socioeconomic status and may also have broad implications for the prevention of a wide range of unhealthy behaviors associated with difficulties with biobehavioral self-regulation.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor biobehavioral self-regulation is believed to contribute to a number of unhealthy behaviors, including overeating and the development of obesity. Improved understanding of the development of associations between biobehavioral self-regulation, eating behavior, and excessive weight gain beginning in the toddler years may hold promise for novel targets for obesity prevention. Given that obesity and struggles with biobehavioral self-regulation are both more common among low-income children, the work may also hold particular promise for addressing socioeconomic disparities in obesity prevalence. In addition, overeating in toddlerhood may provide an important and unprecedented model for the early development of biobehavioral self-regulation contributing to a range of unhealthy behaviors. The results could therefore be broadly applicable to more effective prevention of other unhealthy behaviors such as substance abuse.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Poor biobehavioral self-regulation is believed to contribute to a number of unhealthy behaviors, including overeating and the development of obesity.

"El Valor de Nuestra Salud (The Value of Our Health)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary intake is an important determinant of risk for obesity and cancer. Consumption of fruits and vegetables reduces risk, yet among Latinos, there is now clear evidence that fruit and vegetable consumption decreases with greater acculturation to the U.S. Interventions targeted at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels of the Socio-Ecological Framework have resulted in changes to dietary intake. However, these studies have neglected to consider that unless changes occur at higher levels of influence (e.g., in stores, in restaurants), individual behavior changes are unlikely to be reinforced and sustained. We propose to refine a pilot-tested intervention to change the food environment of grocery stores to promote consumption of fruits and vegetables. El Valor de Nuestra Salud [The Value of Our Health] will identify, recruit, and match 18 grocery stores (specifically small-to-medium sized Latino grocery stores or tiendas) and randomize them into one of two conditions: intervention versus a no-treatment control condition. The intervention will consist of two communication change strategies and two structural change strategies with the goal of changing aspects of the social and physical environments. The intervention will include employee and manager trainings to promote sales of fruits and vegetables and how to conduct a food marketing campaign. In addition, we will provide equipment and other material resources to the tiendas to promote sales of ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables, and to work with them to modify selections available in the meat and ready-to-eat food departments. Efficacy will be evaluated at the store customer level in terms of baseline to immediate post-intervention (6 months post-baseline) changes in self-reported fruit and vegetable intake in a sample of 360 adult store customers, and maintenance of these changes at the 6-month follow-up (12 months post-baseline). Levels of serum carotenoids collected in a 25% subsample of customers will provide evidence for the validity of dietary self- report. Intervention effectiveness will be evaluated at the employee, manager, and store levels using both self-reported and observed methodological approaches. The RE-AIM framework will be used to assess the potential for disseminating the intervention if it results in improvements in customers' dietary intake.

"Accounting for the social gradient in diet quality and health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of the relation between diet quality and diet cost among different strata of the US population has been made possible, for the first time, by the release of the national food price database by the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) in May 2008. The prices were for foods consumed by the participants in the representative population-based 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The NHANES data include a 24-hour dietary recall, a medical examination and completed detailed demographic and health questionnaires. Linking the food price vector ($/100g) with the national Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS 1.0) will allow for the estimation of the monetary value of the diet ($/day and $/2000kcal) at the individual-level, in parallel with the estimation of dietary exposure variables commonly used in studies of diet-disease associations. Being able to link diet costs with the NHANES dietary, demographic, socioeconomic and biomarker data for 5,411 US adults (agee20) will permit a rare first look at the intermediate mechanisms in the model framework that links socioeconomic position (SEP) and health outcomes. Energy and nutrient intakes will be used to calculate energy density and nutrient density of each respondent's diet. The new measure of energy-adjusted diet cost may help explain the observed social gradient in obesity, type II diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Analyses will identify SEP predictors of dietary energy density, diet quality and energy-adjusted diet cost and will elucidate the relations among them, something that has never been done in a large-scale representative sample of US adults. The primary hypothesis is that diet quality and cost will be inversely linked; however the nature of that relation will differ by gender, race/ethnicity and SEP strata. The second series of analyses will provide descriptive data on diet quality and cost for subgroups of interest, including high-risk and vulnerable subgroups of the US population, including food assistance recipients or individuals with established chronic disease. Within the limitations of a cross-sectional study, analyses will explore the relation between diet quality measures, diet cost and health outcomes, including measured body mass index (BMI), biomarkers of inflammation, individual components of the metabolic syndrome (e.g., diabetes, abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, prothrombosis and inflammation), the metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Many of those have been linked to specific components of the diet. The hypothesis is that some of the observed associations between dietary components and health will be attenuated once energy-adjusted diet costs are included in the model. The proposed studies offer a unique first look at the cost of healthful and unhealthful diets in the US and the consequences of food pricing on health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The purpose of this research is to assess the relationship between the cost and quality of diets consumed by groups differing in socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. The study is made possible by new data on national food prices that will be merged with a population-based dietary intake survey. This work addresses economic barriers to nutritious diets and thus provides a vital part of the research on socio-economic disparities in health.

"Environmental Changes and Health Outcomes across 25 Years: Four US Cities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While observational research suggests an association between obesity-related social environment factors with obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors, very little research has addressed the specific factors and pathways linking the social environment to cardiometabolic risk. The primary reasons for this lack of research are: 1) lack of high quality data on diet, activity, measured height and weight over time linked to cardiometabolic risk biomarkers; 2) lack of fine-grain longitudinal data on the introduction, renovation, and closure of food- and activity-related environmental features; and 3) lack of complex statistical models examining each piece of the time-dependent, complex system, accounting for the process by which food, activity, and transportation facilities are established and expanded and the potential for individuals to selectively migrate to locate near such facilities. The 25-year, longitudinal Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study provides a wide age range, high quality longitudinal, biological, behavioral and anthropometry and biomarker data of CARDIA, geographic diversity, and different patterns and pace of change across the four baseline cities: Birmingham, Chicago, Minneapolis and Oakland. The research team has developed a unique method to use retrospective and contemporary sources to create data on the timing and placement of introductions, renovations, and closures of: 1) food resources (e.g., restaurants, food shopping); 2) recreation facilities (e.g., trails, parks); and 3) transportation infrastructure (e.g., light rail, bike parking, bike paths) in Birmingham, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Oakland over a 25-year period. Furthermore, we have developed sophisticated statistical models that account for purposeful (as opposed to random) placement of relevant resources in the social environment as well as individuals' ability to selectively migrate to locate near such resources. Study objectives include: 1) Develop and validate new fine-grain measures to capture introductions, renovations, and closures representing changes in: a) parks, trails, and other recreational sites; b) food environments; and c) transportation infrastructure that will be contemporaneously linked to CARDIA respondents' geographic locations over 25 years; and 2) Using this unique data source, estimate the effects of introductions, renovations, and closures of key food and activity facilities and transportation infrastructure on diet and activity behaviors, body weight and cardiometabolic risk in the four field cities over 25 years, while accounting for the endogenous placement of food and activity facilities and selective migration. We will specifically focus on comparisons across individual-level race, income, and education groups to examine how environmental factors contribute to race and SES inequalities in diet, obesity, and cardiometabolic risk from young- to mid-adulthood. The proposed research will improve current understanding of the mechanisms through which social environments (specifically broader societal, economic, and environmental contexts) influence health outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The US is experiencing substantial burden in obesity and cardiometabolic disease, yet very little research has addressed the specific factors and pathways linking the social environment to cardiometabolic risk. The objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of mechanisms through which social environments influence obesity and cardiometabolic risk, determine which factors in the social environment are particularly influential, and to advance analytic methods to understand these complex pathways. Ultimately the proposed research will inform macro-level social environment policies to mitigate early development of disease risk in the early to middle adult years.              The US is experiencing substantial burden in obesity and cardiometabolic disease, yet very little research has addressed the specific factors and pathways linking the social environment to cardiometabolic risk.

"An Analysis and Monitoring Tool for Small Store Food Environments: the Store Anal    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phase I Obesity is a growing and increasingly serious public health problem that disproportionately affects low-income communities of color. Low-income areas and communities of color tend to have less access to grocery stores and other retail stores that sell healthy foods than higher- income, predominantly Caucasian neighborhoods. These inequities in access to healthy foods may contribute to the increase in obesity rates and pervasive health disparities among low- income communities of color. Reversing obesity trends will require a range of interventions, including a systematic approach to improving food retail environments. Critical to evaluating efforts to improve food retail environments are measures designed to assess small neighborhood stores. Samuels & Associates (S&A) proposes to test the feasibility of developing a web-based software tool, the Store Analysis and Monitoring System (SAMS), which can be use to efficiently assess small store food environments and determine an overall health score for stores based on the quantity and nutritional quality of food and beverage items observed. The long term goal of this project is to enable public health departments, researchers and consumers to use cell phones to accurately and efficiently inventory products in stores, determine health scores and make improvements to store environments. The ability to assess and monitor stores will provide data on the factors that influence eating behaviors and may ultimately help to drive significant improvements in the availability of nutritious foods in stores across the United States.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will support the development of an innovative data collection and analysis software tool, the Store Analysis and Monitoring System (SAMS). The system will be used to inventory foods and beverages in stores and to determine an overall health score for stores based on the quantity and nutritional quality of items observed. Accurate data on store environments and the factors within the stores that encourage or discourage healthy eating behaviors can serve to increase access to healthy foods in under-served communities, influence eating behaviors, and contribute to the prevention of obesity.           This proposal will support the development of an innovative data collection and analysis software tool, the Store Analysis and Monitoring System (SAMS).

"Examining the association between obesity and access to farmers markets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will be conducted among a diverse group of urban and rural women between the ages of 21 and 44 years residing in eastern North Carolina. Women are studied as they are primarily shopping for and preparing family members' food, and thus have a major influence on family member's dietary practices. We propose to use a unique participant recruiting opportunity through a CDC-funded study in the local health department family planning clinic, to enroll a subset of participants from the larger study into a primary qualitative data collection effort to examine neighborhood context and ""food activity spaces"" as viewed by women of diverse demographic groups (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will develop and implement a standard method for mapping farmers' markets. We will then use data collected in Aims 1 and 2 to conduct a secondary data analysis using a larger sample of women (n = 1000) recruited through the CDC-funded study in the local health department (Aim 3). The successful completion of this project will move the field of public health nutrition forward in the following three ways: (1) Determine the geographic boundaries and features of neighborhood and food activity spaces among diverse women by using participants to quantify and describe their activity spaces. This will allow future researchers to more accurately estimate buffer size in Geographic Information Systems. (2) Standardize the methodology for identifying farmers' markets, which will allow others to accurately quantify and disseminate information about markets to consumers and public health practitioners. (3) Provide greater clarity regarding disparities in access to farmers' markets and regarding potential associations between access to farmers' markets and obesity.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is an overwhelming public health problem necessitating community-level solutions. Here we propose to combine data from qualitative interviews, windshield tours, and a geographic information system to: (a) define and examine neighborhood context and ""food activity spaces"" as viewed by diverse women; (b) develop a high-quality measure of the food environment specifically related to farmers' markets; and (c) examine potential access disparities, as well as the association between access to farmers' markets and weight status among 1000 diverse women. Results will inform future research and promising environmental and policy changes to decrease obesity.           Obesity is an overwhelming public health problem necessitating community-level solutions.

"Obesity and Metabolic Risk Disparities: Underlying Food Environment Factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While a major focus of disparities research has been on understanding patterns of health determinants and outcomes by race-ethnic and SES subpopulations, there are major gaps in understanding how to use public policy to reduce these gaps. The proposed project examines food prices and food environment factors, two areas with great potential for policy change. We will use longitudinal data to understand the effects of changes in food prices, and availability and access to away-from-home food eateries and food shopping options on diet, and in turn, weight gain and metabolic risk factors. We will finalize a longitudinal data set that geographically and temporally links food price and food environment measures to residential locations of respondents of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a study of the antecedents and risk factors for cardiovascular disease in an ethnicity-, age-, and sex-balanced cohort of 5,115 black and white young adults aged 18-30 years at baseline (1985-86) and followed over 25 years into 2010-11. We capitalize upon neighborhood-level data linked to individual data using a multidisciplinary approach melding spatial analysis methodologies with traditional epidemiological and economic methods. We examine how food prices and neighborhood food and social environmental factors interact with individual-level household income and education to affect the adoption and maintenance of overall measures of beverage and diet quality. Furthermore, we will examine the effect of these behaviors on change in weight and metabolic risk factors (e.g., fasting glucose, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL and HDL cholesterol) over 25 years. We specifically examine how these relationships differ by individual-level race/ethnicity, income, and education. The proposed study builds on work we have done to create a CARDIA neighborhood-level dataset consisting of price and economic data for Exam Years 1-20 and a food environment dataset for years 1-15 (we currently do not have food environment data for year 20). Specific aims include: 1) Add identical food environment data for Year 20 (2005-06) when we will have the third wave of individual-level dietary data; 2) Create and implement a full structural equations model with a specific focus on comparisons within race-ethnicity (black versus white), income (high versus low), education (high versus low) to jointly examine the temporal impact of economic and food environment factors on: (a) individual-level beverage intake and overall diet quality, (b) patterns of weight maintenance and gain, and (c) the incidence, persistence, and reversal on the above metabolic risk factors (controlling for residential choice, pregnancy and marriage status, physical activity and smoking). Using this full system we will be able to examine the full set of relationships between food prices and food environment factors with diet, weight and metabolic risk factors.

"Building capacity in food bank organizations for obesity prevention programs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a serious public health problem in the United States and increases risk for cancer and other chronic diseases. Obesity as well as cancer rates are high for poor, low-income, Hispanic, and African- American populations, compared with Caucasians and individuals from higher-income families. Reducing obesity can play an important role in reducing these disparities in cancer and chronic disease rates. Innovative intervention strategies are needed to reduce this gap in obesity prevalence between the low-income underserved population and higher-income groups. Many low income families depend on food banks to supply foods each month. Food banks, therefore, are potential existing channels to reach low-income individuals, who are at higher risk for obesity and obesity-related diseases, with health education messages. However, very little has been done to explore this opportunity. The HFB provides food assistance to approximately 500,000 low-income individuals annually (24 percent of individuals served in TX) with the help of its 400 community based agencies (churches, food pantries, and community kitchens). A goal of the HFB is to impact client health behaviors related to weight. However, effective and acceptable methods and strategies to accomplish this goal are unknown, and are of great interest to the HFB. Our proposed study represents a model initiative in which the HFB, its agencies, and the Children's Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) collaborate and coordinate efforts to build the capacity within the HFB system, to provide nutrition education for obesity prevention as well as cancer and other chronic disease risk reduction. This innovative and highly significant R21 application will investigate the potential of food banks to integrate nutrition education into their usual operations using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles. This innovative study will provide data that will enable us to establish effect sizes, sample size, as well as a successful intervention for obesity prevention, and reduction of cancer and other chronic disease risks, using a food bank setting for a future R01, that will include large scale randomized control trial of the intervention(s).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The HFB and other food banks in the United States provide an untapped channel to reach a large number of low-income underserved at-risk populations, and improve their dietary behaviors associated with cancer prevention. The proposed collaborative research and training activities seek to develop an intervention in obesity prevention/reduction in order to reduce cancer risks due to energy imbalance/obesity among low- income food insecure individuals using this untapped channel.             Relevance:  The HFB and other food banks in the United States provide an untapped channel to reach a large number of low-income underserved at-risk populations, and improve their dietary behaviors associated with cancer prevention.

"Multiethnic Cohort Study of Diet and Cancer The Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study was designed to prospectively investigate the relationship of diet an other lifestyle factors to cancer risk in five ethnic groups (African Americans, Japanese Americans, Latinos Native Hawaiians and Caucasians),and to explore interactions between these risk factors and geneti susceptibility to cancer. Since establishment of the cohort in 1993-96, more than 10 years of follow-up hav accrued on the 215,000 participants, bringing the project to a point where its full potential can now b realized. In the current cycle of support, we are re-administering the baseline questionnaire to obtai updated (10-year) dietary and other information on the subjects (e.g., smoking, physical activity, hormona usage, medications, intercurrent illnesses). We have been analyzing data from the baseline questionnaire both dietary and non-dietary, as well as data on genetic susceptibility and gene-environment interactions Altogether, we have published 50 papers from the cohort since early 2003. We have been among the mos active participants in NCI's Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium, and have shared our data wit other members of the consortium, as well as with investigators at outside institutions. For the next 5-yea period, we have several dietary scientific aims, including further research into the basis for ethni differences we observed in diet and cancer relationships, investigation of hypotheses related to dietar constituents recently added to our food composition table (e.g., trans fatty acids, heme iron, glycemic load heterocyclic amines), study of some less common sites (e.g., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovary and kidney) more in-depth subgroup analyses (e.g., by histology and stage), and investigations of the relationship of die to cancer survival. We also have several non-dietary scientific aims, particularly related to investigating as yet unexplainable ethnic differences in breast and lung cancer risk. The important work necessary t maintain the cohort and its several databases will continue, including administration of another short follow up questionnaire and regular enhancements to the unique food composition table. Finally, we will continu to train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. We expect this research not only to expand knowledg of the role of environmental risk factors and genes in cancer risk, but also to further an understanding of th basis for ethnic/racial disparities in cancer occurrence and survival.

"Food Environment, Diet Quality and Disparities in Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle Obesity Study (S.O.S) seeks to explain why obesity rates are more prevalent among some racial/ethnic minorities, population subgroups of lower education and incomes, and in high-poverty areas. The study will recruit a longitudinal cohort of 400 male and female adults, ages 21-65y, and resident in Seattle-King County and stratified by income and race/ethnicity, using an address-based sampling scheme. Data on food seeking behavior will be collected using a combination of self report and objective measures. At the first in- person interview, participants will complete a behavior survey module on food shopping and dietary habits, estimated food expenditures, nutrition literacy, attitudes towards diet and health, demographics, and health status. Health-related questions will address obesity, diabetes, stress, and cardiovascular disease. Height, weight, and waist circumference will be measured. A GPS receiver with data logging capability will be used to track the participants' movements and to record the time and location of all food-related events for 1 wk. Food store and restaurant receipts, stamped with time and date, will be collected for 4 wks. Foods brought into the home will be scanned with a portable UPC scanner for 4 wks. Three 24-h food recalls will be administered by phone in wks 3 and 4, and food frequency questionnaires will be administered in week 4 of data collection. To be able to establish causality between environmental and dietary variables and health outcomes, the behavior survey module and the food frequency questionnaire will be re-administered during a follow up visit 18 months later and anthropometric measures will be collected for the second time. Data on foods purchased for use at home and foods consumed away from home will be linked to individual-level metrics of the built environment based on tax parcel data. The main aim of the study is to assess the impact of SEP, environmental, and dietary variables on obesity and body weight gain. The hypothesis is that low dietary quality and low diet cost will be associated with prevalent obesity and will predict 18 mo. weight gain, adjusting for SEP. This model will be built on data collected and validated under Aims 2 and 3. The second aim will be to assess how access to food sources (both physical and economic), retail outlet choice, and food purchases impact diet quality across SEP strata. The hypothesis is that diet quality will be influenced strongly by price and other economic variables than by proximity to food sources. The third aim will be to validate self-reported data on food acquisition and expenditures against objective measures of individual behavior in space and time. The hypothesis is that objective measures of food purchase behaviors based on GPS logs, food store and restaurant receipts, and UPC scanner data will provide new insights into the energy and nutrient content of foods that are acquired at different locations. Study results have the potential of informing local and national policies on improving retail access to affordable healthy foods by vulnerable groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A better understanding of factors that may explain social disparities in diet quality and chronic diseases is critical. The proposed longitudinal study seeks to explain the role of built environment, economics, psychosocial factors, SEP and demographics on food seeking behaviors, diet quality, obesity and body weight gain. This interdisciplinary project on the built environment, behavior and health brings together experts from nutrition, geography, epidemiology, medicine, statistics and urban design.

"Pathways from Food Insecurity to Health and Treatment Outcomes in Women with HIV     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected women have higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared to men in the United States (U.S.). An important driver of health disparities and worse outcomes among HIV-infected women is food insecurity, or the inability to access food of sufficient quality or quantity in socially acceptable ways. Food insecurity affects 18 million households in the U.S. (40% of low income households), is more prevalent among women, and affects about half of urban poor HIV-infected individuals. Food insecurity is associated with worse immunologic and virologic outcomes in cross-sectional studies, increased HIV-related morbidity and mortality in longitudinal studies, and increased cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) in cross-sectional studies in the general population. Due to these negative health impacts among HIV-infected individuals, governmental and non-governmental organizations have argued to integrate food security and HIV/AIDS programming activities. A rigorous longitudinal study is urgently needed to quantify the impacts and identify the dominant mechanisms by which food insecurity negatively impacts health in order to improve the effectiveness and reach of food assistance programs and guide their integration with HIV/AIDS programs.  The proposed research assembles experts from medicine, infectious disease, immunology, biostatistics, and nutrition for a 4-year longitudinal study to quantify the impacts and identify the pathways linking food insecurity to HIV treatment and cardiovascular health in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). WIHS is an ongoing, prospective study in the U.S. of 1500 HIV-infected women and 650 non-infected, but at-risk, women. We plan to leverage the detailed HIV treatment and cardiovascular risk measures collected in WIHS to accomplish 3 aims. In aims 1 and 2, we hypothesize that food insecurity will be associated with worse HIV treatment and cardiovascular risk outcomes and that these relationships will be partially mediated by nutritional (food quality/quantity, obesity), mental health (depression, stress), and behavioral (treatment non-adherence, missed appointments) pathways. To accomplish aims 1 and 2, we will add measures of food insecurity, dietary quality, socio-economic status, competing demands between food and medical care, and antiretroviral (ARV) hair levels (a technique we pioneered as an objective measure of ARV adherence) to WIHS. Our analytic approach will be guided by a novel conceptual model that we recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. In aim 3, we hypothesize that food insecurity will be associated with markers of gut microbial translocation (MT), inflammation and immune activation among HIV-infected women, and that this association will be mediated by diet, obesity, and worse HIV control. To accomplish aim 3, we will add measures of gut MT and immune activation for a sub-sample of 250 women on ARV therapy. Our work will be critical to attract funding for this priority issue. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop sustainable solutions to tackle the intersecting challenges of food insecurity and HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality among women in the U.S.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Food insecurity is common among poor women and HIV-infected persons, and has been associated with more illness, higher risk of heart disease, and quicker decline to AIDS and death. The proposed study brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts for a 4-year study among over 2000 women to answer two key unresolved questions, namely ""What is the magnitude of the impact of food security on health?"" and ""Which mechanisms drive this impact?"" This research will be critical to a) help increase funding for the integration of HIV and nutrition programs in the U.S. and elsewhere; b) select among the various programmatic options for improving food insecurity among HIV-infected women; and c) improve the reach and effectiveness of existing supplemental nutritional assistance programs.              Food insecurity is common among poor women and HIV-infected persons, and has been associated with more illness, higher risk of heart disease, and quicker decline to AIDS and death.

"The Effect of Corner Store Makeovers on Store Patrons and Nearby Corner Stores     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence suggests that overweight and obesity outcomes are affected by the food environment, or the distribution of healthy and unhealthy food outlets around the places where people live, work, and go to school. An emerging approach to improving the food environment in low income and minority communities is the 'corner store makeover,' which involves partnering with local corner stores to expand access to fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, and other healthy food. ""Corner Store Makeovers in East Los Angeles: Improving Healthy Food Access"" is an NHLBI-funded research project that is currently being conducted by the UCLA/USC Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD). The project is working with four intervention stores in East L.A. to greatly expand their inventories of fresh produce and other healthy food, as well as to reconfigure each store's layout to make healthy food more prominent and visually appealing. In addition, the project is working with youth from local high schools to develop a community-driven and culturally competent social marketing campaign that promotes healthy food and the made over stores.  In this study, I propose to complement the existing evaluation strategy of the corner store makeovers project by evaluating its effects on: 1) store patrons, and 2) corner stores that are nearby intervention stores. To assess the effects of the intervention on store patrons, I propose to work with trained students and staff at CPHHD to conduct pre/post- interviews with patrons at four intervention and four comparison stores. This evaluation study will help us to assess the effect of corner store makeovers on patrons' nutrition knowledge and attitudes towards the store and to determine if corner store makeovers change the healthfulness of their food purchasing and consumption. To evaluate the effect of the intervention on nearby corner stores, I propose to conduct a longitudinal study of healthy food inventories and in-store advertisements at five corner stores nearby each of the intervention and comparison stores. Due to the social marketing campaign and substantial media coverage of the corner store makeovers project, I believe that demand for healthy food will increase substantially in the neighborhoods surrounding intervention stores. As a result, nearby stores may be motivated to make their own healthy changes. Each of these supplemental evaluation components will greatly add to the very limited empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of the corner store makeovers strategy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An emerging approach to increasing access to healthy food in low income and minority communities is the 'corner store makeover,' which involves partnering with local corner stores to expand access to fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, and other healthy food. I propose to evaluate how a corner store makeover project in East Los Angeles affects store patrons and nearby corner stores.

"El Valor de Nuestra Salud (The Value of Our Health)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary intake is an important determinant of risk for obesity and cancer. Consumption of fruits and vegetables reduces risk, yet among Latinos, there is now clear evidence that fruit and vegetable consumption decreases with greater acculturation to the U.S. Interventions targeted at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels of the Socio-Ecological Framework have resulted in changes to dietary intake. However, these studies have neglected to consider that unless changes occur at higher levels of influence (e.g., in stores, in restaurants), individual behavior changes are unlikely to be reinforced and sustained. We propose to refine a pilot-tested intervention to change the food environment of grocery stores to promote consumption of fruits and vegetables. El Valor de Nuestra Salud [The Value of Our Health] will identify, recruit, and match 18 grocery stores (specifically small-to-medium sized Latino grocery stores or tiendas) and randomize them into one of two conditions: intervention versus a no-treatment control condition. The intervention will consist of two communication change strategies and two structural change strategies with the goal of changing aspects of the social and physical environments. The intervention will include employee and manager trainings to promote sales of fruits and vegetables and how to conduct a food marketing campaign. In addition, we will provide equipment and other material resources to the tiendas to promote sales of ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables, and to work with them to modify selections available in the meat and ready-to-eat food departments. Efficacy will be evaluated at the store customer level in terms of baseline to immediate post-intervention (6 months post-baseline) changes in self-reported fruit and vegetable intake in a sample of 360 adult store customers, and maintenance of these changes at the 6-month follow-up (12 months post-baseline). Levels of serum carotenoids collected in a 25% subsample of customers will provide evidence for the validity of dietary self- report. Intervention effectiveness will be evaluated at the employee, manager, and store levels using both self-reported and observed methodological approaches. The RE-AIM framework will be used to assess the potential for disseminating the intervention if it results in improvements in customers' dietary intake. This study is responsive to NCI's call for proposals on Diet and Communication, and given the involvement of a Mexican/Mexican-American population, is responsive to NCI's mission to reduce racial/ethnic health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Risk for obesity and certain cancers are higher among U.S. Latinos as compared with non-Latinos. Risk factors for obesity and cancer include not eating enough fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods, and this is particularly pronounced among Latinos who have less access to healthy foods.

"Neural Correlates of Food Reward in American Indian Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 award will allow Dr. Beckman, the first American Indian (AI) adult endocrinologist in the nation, to become an investigator proficient in interdisciplinary research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the causes of obesity. She has a career interest in the neuropsychology of obesity and diabetes and her focus is on the AI population in Minnesota. Obesity is a major health disparity in AIs, yet litle work is being done to unravel the neurobiology of this problem. The training and research activities will allow her to examine the complexities of computational neuroscience, functional neuroanatomy, and the contribution of opioidergic neurons to brain reward pathways. The application proposes an intensive, 5-year program of mentored research and formal training activities to enhance Dr. Beckman's skills and experience in: 1) clinical research methods and biostatistics, 2) technical aspects of fMRI data acquisition and analysis, and 3) role of opioidergic neurons in the neuroendocrine regulation of appetite. In the long term, Dr. Beckman will apply these translational research skills to study neuromodulation, cognitive restructuring, and opioid antagonists as potentially effective treatments for the public health problem of obesity in her AI patients who may be hyperresponsive to environmentally rewarding food cues.  The research component of this career development award targets the neurobiology of behavioral responses to food in 60 AIs. The specific aims are to: 1) use fMRI to compare brain activation associated with the response to visual food cues in obese versus lean AI women, 2) use fMRI to compare the effects of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, versus placebo, on brain activation associated with response to palatable food cues, 3) compare the effects of naltrexone versus placebo on food intake in obese and lean AI women, by measuring calories consumed.  The University of Minnesota is an exceptional environment for Dr. Beckman to gain the skills needed to achieve her goals. The training component uses academic resources including the Division of Diabetes, Metabolism, and Endocrinology, Minnesota Obesity Center, Center for the Study of Impulsivity in Addiction, Center for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Clinical and Translational Science Institute. Dr. Beckman's mentors are highly regarded scientists in the areas of obesity, addiction, and neuroimaging.          Despite the disproportionate obesity burden among AIs, this will be the first study using fMRI and an opioid antagonist to focus on this underrepresented population. Our results will provide important data about brain activation in response to high-calorie foods that will inform dietary interventions aimed at preventing and treating obesity and may identify a promising pharmacologic treatment for obesity and overeating in AIs.

"Obesity and Metabolic Risk Disparities: Underlying Food Environment Factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While a major focus of disparities research has been on understanding patterns of health determinants and outcomes by race-ethnic and SES subpopulations, there are major gaps in understanding how to use public policy to reduce these gaps. The proposed project examines food prices and food environment factors, two areas with great potential for policy change. We will use longitudinal data to understand the effects of changes in food prices, and availability and access to away-from-home food eateries and food shopping options on diet, and in turn, weight gain and metabolic risk factors. We will finalize a longitudinal data set that geographically and temporally links food price and food environment measures to residential locations of respondents of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a study of the antecedents and risk factors for cardiovascular disease in an ethnicity-, age-, and sex-balanced cohort of 5,115 black and white young adults aged 18-30 years at baseline (1985-86) and followed over 25 years into 2010-11. We capitalize upon neighborhood-level data linked to individual data using a multidisciplinary approach melding spatial analysis methodologies with traditional epidemiological and economic methods. We examine how food prices and neighborhood food and social environmental factors interact with individual-level household income and education to affect the adoption and maintenance of overall measures of beverage and diet quality. Furthermore, we will examine the effect of these behaviors on change in weight and metabolic risk factors (e.g., fasting glucose, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL and HDL cholesterol) over 25 years. We specifically examine how these relationships differ by individual-level race/ethnicity, income, and education. The proposed study builds on work we have done to create a CARDIA neighborhood-level dataset consisting of price and economic data for Exam Years 1-20 and a food environment dataset for years 1-15 (we currently do not have food environment data for year 20). Specific aims include: 1) Add identical food environment data for Year 20 (2005-06) when we will have the third wave of individual-level dietary data; 2) Create and implement a full structural equations model with a specific focus on comparisons within race-ethnicity (black versus white), income (high versus low), education (high versus low) to jointly examine the temporal impact of economic and food environment factors on: (a) individual-level beverage intake and overall diet quality, (b) patterns of weight maintenance and gain, and (c) the incidence, persistence, and reversal on the above metabolic risk factors (controlling for residential choice, pregnancy and marriage status, physical activity and smoking). Using this full system we will be able to examine the full set of relationships between food prices and food environment factors with diet, weight and metabolic risk factors. Our overall impact is to identify economic and food environment factors that are associated with health and can be addressed as potential targets for intervention to reduce disparities in obesity and metabolic risk.

"Multiethnic Cohort Study of Diet and Cancer The Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study was designed to prospectively investigate the relationship of diet and  other lifestyle factors to cancer risk in five ethnic groups (African Americans, Japanese Americans, Latinos,  Native Hawaiians and Caucasians),and to explore interactions between these risk factors and genetic  susceptibility to cancer. Since establishment of the cohort in 1993-96, more than 10 years of follow-up have  accrued on the 215,000 participants, bringing the project to a point where its full potential can now be  realized. In the current cycle of support, we are re-administering the baseline questionnaire to obtain  updated (10-year) dietary and other information on the subjects (e.g., smoking, physical activity, hormonal  usage, medications, intercurrent illnesses). We have been analyzing data from the baseline questionnaire,  both dietary and non-dietary, as well as data on genetic susceptibility and gene-environment interactions.  Altogether, we have published 50 papers from the cohort since early 2003. We have been among the most  active participants in NCI's Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium, and have shared our data with  other members of the consortium, as well as with investigators at outside institutions. For the next 5-year  period, we have several dietary scientific aims, including further research into the basis for ethnic  differences we observed in diet and cancer relationships, investigation of hypotheses related to dietary  constituents recently added to our food composition table (e.g., trans fatty acids, heme iron, glycemic load,  heterocyclic amines), study of some less common sites (e.g., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovary and kidney),  more in-depth subgroup analyses (e.g., by histology and stage), and investigations of the relationship of diet  to cancer survival. We also have several non-dietary scientific aims, particularly related to investigating as-  yet unexplainable ethnic differences in breast and lung cancer risk. The important work necessary to  maintain the cohort and its several databases will continue, including administration of another short follow-  up questionnaire and regular enhancements to the unique food composition table. Finally, we will continue  to train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. We expect this research not only to expand knowledge  of the role of environmental risk factors and genes in cancer risk, but also to further an understanding of the  basis for ethnic/racial disparities in cancer occurrence and survival.

"El Valor de Nuestra Salud (The Value of Our Health)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary intake is an important determinant of risk for obesity and cancer. Consumption of fruits and vegetables reduces risk, yet among Latinos, there is now clear evidence that fruit and vegetable consumption decreases with greater acculturation to the U.S. Interventions targeted at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels of the Socio-Ecological Framework have resulted in changes to dietary intake. However, these studies have neglected to consider that unless changes occur at higher levels of influence (e.g., in stores, in restaurants), individual behavior changes are unlikely to be reinforced and sustained. We propose to refine a pilot-tested intervention to change the food environment of grocery stores to promote consumption of fruits and vegetables.

The intervention will include employee and manager trainings to promote sales of fruits and vegetables and how to conduct a food marketing campaign. In addition, we will provide equipment and other material resources to the tiendas to promote sales of ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables, and to work with them to modify selections available in the meat and ready-to-eat food departments.

"EXCESS BMI GAIN DURING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: THE ROLE OF CONTEXTUAL FACTORS SUMMARY  The prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents has been increasing dramatically with low-income and some racial/ethnic minority populations being at highest risk. Rising obesity rates and socioeconomic disparities in obesity stem from social and environmental factors that need to be understood and modified for effective prevention. In this project, we propose to follow a cohort of 20,000 children through elementary school, a period when demographic disparities in obesity manifest themselves, to study their physical development, health behaviors, and the relationship of these outcomes and behaviors to the food and physical activity environments in their residential and school neighborhoods. Our specific aims are as follows: 1. Describe how the food and physical activity environments around residences and schools differ for children from different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 2. Describe how the food and physical activity environments inside elementary schools differ for children from different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 3. Analyze the relationship between food and physical activity environments and health behaviors, by socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. 4. Analyze the contribution of food and physical activity environments in the development of disparities in body mass index (BMI) in children from kindergarten through 5th (and for some analyses 8th) grade. RELEVANCE  School and residential environments are likely to shape children's health behaviors, but their contribution to excess weight gain are unknown. This project tries to identify environmental factors of excess weight gain during elementary school years, which includes the age where sociodemographic disparities in overweight begin to manifest themselves. This is a necessary task before considering whether proposed interventions and policy changes are promising or likely to lead down a blind alley.

"American Indian Diabetes Prevention Center:  Impacting Health Disparity in Youth PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions); This project collaboratively forges an alternative future for American Indian people relative to diabetes.  Several disciplines are joined from within the clinical health, social, behavioral, and cultural sciences as well as native advisors to comprise the intellectual engine of this proposed center. Knitting these diverse professional cultures into an effective interdisciplinary force will be done by iterative psychoeducational seminars. The Specific Aims are to reduce health disparities among American Indian (Al) people by 1) conducting medical and sociocultural research strengthening diabetes prevention and management in the context of contemporary Al culture, 2) developing interdisciplinary values and skills pervading all operations, 3) developing curricula fostering new skills and manpower in health disparities research, 4) collaborating with Al communities to produce diabetes education in culturally appropriate ways using new, easily accessed media, and 5) administering Center operations by Al's with Al perspectives that honor all people and things. The Administrative Core is composed of the PI, Project Coordinator, Administrative Director, and two staff assistants. This Core will manage all Center functions. The Research Core has three Research Sub- Projects: 1) discovering cultural categories of parental distress due to diabetes care of children with Type 1and 2 diabetes for use in behavioral medicine counseling, 2) testing efficacy of financial incentives for increasing physical activity in obese youth and change in cardiometabolic status, and 3) comparing the differential risk for preeclampsia among Caucasian, American Indian, and Hispanic women to explore hypothesized protective effects in indigenous people of the Western hemisphere. The Research Training/Education Core will 1) develop a new certificate program in nursing on health disparity reduction research, practice, and ethics, 2) develop the capacity to produce a series of 12-minute video stories (a highly valued approach to teaching among Al's) for dissemination and evaluation, and 3) conduct education on diabetes to Al adults with integrated encouragement to serve as health disparities research subjects. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core will 1) conduct a Youth Asset building program using community, family, and individual factors that assist youth in avoiding risky health behaviors, 2) evaluate the CDC Eagle Books in public schools with high Al enrollment, and 3) add a new community partner comprised of owners of rural, small food stores to begin promoting healthy foods, and 4) continue the Oklahoma City Area Intertribal Health Board partnership of all tribes in Oklahoma. Texas, and Kansas.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project will improve the public's health by reducing the unacceptably huge diabetes health disparity crisis among Al people through finding better means to: provide clinical care in its treatment, prevent onset, reduce familial distress in chronic disease coping, develop better healthy decision-making among youth, and develop better means to  communicate healthy lifestyle choices. The project also creates a collaboration with rural, small food outlets as ""Good Food Neighbors"" to promote selling healthier foods and introduces ""digital storytelling"" appropriate to Indian Country by the production of a series of real stories of success in diabetes coping and prevention.",American Indian Diabetes Prevention Center:  Impacting Health Disparity in

"Impact of a Public-Private Mobile Market to Improve Fruit & Vegetable Access     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lower-income and minority groups face significant health disparities with respect to obesity, cancer, heart disease and other chronic conditions. Poor diets, low in fruits and vegetables (F&V) and high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar, contribute to many of the health problems faced by vulnerable groups. While poverty, low- educational attainment and personal food preference are all associated with reduced F&V consumption, these individual-level factors must be viewed in an environmental context. Research has repeatedly demonstrated the important role that environment plays on health decisions and behaviors. Compared with higher-income neighborhoods, lower-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to have a supermarket that sells a variety of F&V and other healthy foods. This is perpetuated by an underlying misconception that there is limited demand or potential profit for new healthy food ventures in these communities. In the few cases where new food outlets have opened in underserved areas, they have been met with substantial customer support. The NC Green Cart program hopes to demonstrate that selling affordable, accessible F&V in lower-income communities is not only financially viable, but can impact behavioral risk factors of individuals in target communities. The NC Green Cart program will build on burgeoning support for a local sustainable food system in NC and leverage a public-private partnership to increase access to fresh F&V in underserved communities. Using a weekly mobile market model, the program will deliver low-cost boxes of fresh F&V to easily accessible community locations (such as churches and day care centers) and provide nutrition and cooking education. Working together with the Green Cart team, this project will 1.) measure the impact of a mobile market at 6, 12 and 18 months on the primary outcome of F&V consumption as well as perceived access to F&V and self- efficacy to purchase, prepare, serve and eat fresh F&V using a randomized controlled design; 2.) assess community support, feasibility, and financial sustainability of the public-private Green Cart partnership; and 3.) explore policy-related barriers and facilitators to the public-private Green Cart operation that could influence future growth and dissemination of the model.

"The Intra-household Distribution of Food and Health Resources amongst Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Policies targeting health improvements for particular household members can, as a result of resource allocation adjustments, have repercussions for all household members. Understanding how these spillovers work within the household could enable the design of smarter health policies which take into account households' optimal readjustments. But we cannot fully measure these reallocation responses without data on dietary intake, which is arguably the most important health resource, especially for children in low-income settings. I propose to 1) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to collect such data, and 2) use it to analyze the effects of nutrition interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources.  To accomplish the first goal, I will engage in three training activities which will enable me to learn about key concepts in nutritional science and measurement issues in dietary intake assessment in low-income settings: 1) coursework, 2) mentoring meetings, and 3) dissemination of my work. To accomplish the second, I will engage in a research program related to understanding the intra-household spillovers of targeted nutrition interventions, focusing on iodine supplementation.  Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) has significant and irreversible effects on cognitive development.  One third of the global population has IDD. Low in utero exposure to iodine leads to reduced intelligence quotients, and in severe cases can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery and growth, hearing and speech problems. Iodine supplementation and fortification programs-both in utero and in early childhood-have been proven to increase child health and cognitive ability, and are thus often used as policy tools in affected areas. Supplementation programs are usually targeted towards pregnant women and young children. However, little is known about how these interventions affect other children in the household who are not targeted.  My research program has 3 specific aims: 1) collect novel data which combine socioeconomic and demographic information with dietary intake measurements for every child in the household; 2) document the patterns of intra-household allocation of food and other health resources; and 3) study the effects of fetal and early childhood iodine supplementation interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources amongst children.  I will accomplish the first aim by designing a dietary intake assessment module and integrating it into a large-scale household panel survey in Ghana. I will accomplish Aim 2 by performing preliminary analyses with these new data. I will accomplish the last aim through two studies. In the first, I will study the effects of a large feta iodine supplementation program in Tanzania using an existing, nationally representative dataset. In this study, I will apply econometric techniques developed for intra-household analyses to examine whether children exposed to more iodine while in utero receive more health resources than their untreated siblings during childhood. In the second study, I will implement and analyze data from a pilot field experiment that will distribute iodine supplements to children under 5 in Ghana. The experiment will run concurrently with the panel survey data collection, allowing me to measure the resulting changes in dietary intake and other health resource allocations.  Without quantifying the household responses to childhood nutrition interventions, particularly in the context of iodine supplementation policies, it is impossible to know the full impact of these programs. Answering this question-are we helping or hurting other children in the household through targeted interventions?-is essential to the design and improved cost-benefit analysis of childhood nutrition programs around the world.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is impossible to gauge the full impacts of childhood nutrition interventions without measuring how households redistribute resources among children in response.

"Self-Regulation as a Biological Mechanism for Excess Weight Gain in Toddlers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor biobehavioral self-regulation likely contributes to a number of unhealthy behaviors as individuals seek and consume substances that improve self-regulation at a neurobiological level. Poor self-regulation begins very early in the lifespan, at a time when food is the only accessible substance with biological properties that aid the individual's ability to self-regulate. Children with poor self-regulation may therefore be more likely to tantrum for food, overeat and become overweight. There have been no studies to date integrating knowledge of biobehavioral self-regulation with eating behavior, dietary intake and weight status in early childhood. The study team was awarded a Challenge Grant in 2009 to examine some of these associations in low-income 3- to 5-year-olds, and the preliminary results of this project already demonstrate robust associations between aberrant diurnal salivary cortisol patterns, food-related tantrums, and overweight, beginning at age 36 months. In this low-income population, 40 percent of the children are already overweight by age 36 months, and a significant increase in overweight prevalence seems to occur around age 24 months. This application, therefore, proposes to collect measures of salivary cortisol and alpha amylase, self-regulation, eating behavior, diet, and anthropometry from 250 low-income children longitudinally at ages 21, 27, and 33 months. The study will provide more in-depth measures of these constructs from a younger cohort than has ever previously been studied, and in the low-income demographic that is at very high risk for both poor biobehavioral self-regulation and obesity. Structural equation modeling will be used to examine these potential associations. The aims are to examine, among low-income toddlers longitudinally: (1) the relative contributions of food-related self-regulation, non-food related self-regulation, and salivary cortisol and alpha amylase to preference for comfort foods, emotional eating behavior, and weight status, and to determine if these relationships differ across ages 21, 27, and 33 months; (2) relationships between biobehavioral markers of self-regulation at 21 months with changes in weight status between 21 and 33 months, mediated by preference for comfort foods and emotional eating; (3) trajectories of the development of behavioral self-regulation, and to determine if these trajectories are associated with differences in preference for comfort foods, emotional eating behavior, and weight status at 33 months, independent of physiological markers of self-regulation at baseline. The results of this study will have implications for understanding biobehavioral mechanisms of excessive weight gain in toddlerhood, and thereby potentially contribute to more effective, novel, targeted prevention approaches. The results will also improve the understanding of contributors to health disparities based on socioeconomic status and may also have broad implications for the prevention of a wide range of unhealthy behaviors associated with difficulties with biobehavioral self-regulation.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor biobehavioral self-regulation is believed to contribute to a number of unhealthy behaviors, including overeating and the development of obesity. Improved understanding of the development of associations between biobehavioral self-regulation, eating behavior, and excessive weight gain beginning in the toddler years may hold promise for novel targets for obesity prevention. Given that obesity and struggles with biobehavioral self-regulation are both more common among low-income children, the work may also hold particular promise for addressing socioeconomic disparities in obesity prevalence. In addition, overeating in toddlerhood may provide an important and unprecedented model for the early development of biobehavioral self-regulation contributing to a range of unhealthy behaviors. The results could therefore be broadly applicable to more effective prevention of other unhealthy behaviors such as substance abuse.

"Examining the association between obesity and access to farmers markets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will be conducted among a diverse group of urban and rural women between the ages of 21 and 44 years residing in eastern North Carolina. Women are studied as they are primarily shopping for and preparing family members' food, and thus have a major influence on family member's dietary practices. We propose to use a unique participant recruiting opportunity through a CDC-funded study in the local health department family planning clinic, to enroll a subset of participants from the larger study into a primary qualitative data collection effort to examine neighborhood context and ""food activity spaces"" as viewed by women of diverse demographic groups (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will develop and implement a standard method for mapping farmers' markets. We will then use data collected in Aims 1 and 2 to conduct a secondary data analysis using a larger sample of women (n = 1000) recruited through the CDC-funded study in the local health department (Aim 3). The successful completion of this project will move the field of public health nutrition forward in the following three ways: (1) Determine the geographic boundaries and features of neighborhood and food activity spaces among diverse women by using participants to quantify and describe their activity spaces. This will allow future researchers to more accurately estimate buffer size in Geographic Information Systems. (2) Standardize the methodology for identifying farmers' markets, which will allow others to accurately quantify and disseminate information about markets to consumers and public health practitioners. (3) Provide greater clarity regarding disparities in access to farmers' markets and regarding potential associations between access to farmers' markets and obesity.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is an overwhelming public health problem necessitating community-level solutions. Here we propose to combine data from qualitative interviews, windshield tours, and a geographic information system to: (a) define and examine neighborhood context and ""food activity spaces"" as viewed by diverse women; (b) develop a high-quality measure of the food environment specifically related to farmers' markets; and (c) examine potential access disparities, as well as the association between access to farmers' markets and weight status among 1000 diverse women.

"Environmental Changes and Health Outcomes across 25 Years: Four US Cities  ABSTRACT While observational research suggests an association between obesity-related social environment factors with obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors, very little research has addressed the specific factors and pathways linking the social environment to cardiometabolic risk. The primary reasons for this lack of research are: 1) lack of high quality data on diet, activity, measured height and weight over time linked to cardiometabolic risk biomarkers; 2) lack of fine-grain longitudinal data on the introduction, renovation, and closure of food- and activity-related environmental features; and 3) lack of complex statistical models examining each piece of the time-dependent, complex system, accounting for the process by which food, activity, and transportation facilities are established and expanded and the potential for individuals to selectively migrate to locate near such facilities. The 25-year, longitudinal Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study provides a wide age range, high quality longitudinal, biological, behavioral and anthropometry and biomarker data of CARDIA, geographic diversity, and different patterns and pace of change across the four baseline cities: Birmingham, Chicago, Minneapolis and Oakland. The research team has developed a unique method to use retrospective and contemporary sources to create data on the timing and placement of introductions, renovations, and closures of: 1) food resources (e.g., restaurants, food shopping); 2) recreation facilities (e.g., trails, parks); and 3) transportation infrastructure (e.g., light rail, bike parking, bike paths) in Birmingham, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Oakland over a 25-year period. Furthermore, we have developed sophisticated statistical models that account for purposeful (as opposed to random) placement of relevant resources in the social environment as well as individuals' ability to selectively migrate to locate near such resources. Study objectives include: 1) Develop and validate new fine-grain measures to capture introductions, renovations, and closures representing changes in: a) parks, trails, and other recreational sites; b) food environments; and c) transportation infrastructure that will be contemporaneously linked to CARDIA respondents' geographic locations over 25 years; and 2) Using this unique data source, estimate the effects of introductions, renovations, and closures of key food and activity facilities and transportation infrastructure on diet and activity behaviors, body weight and cardiometabolic risk in the four field cities over 25 years, while accounting for the endogenous placement of food and activity facilities and selective migration. We will specifically focus on comparisons across individual-level race, income, and education groups to examine how environmental factors contribute to race and SES inequalities in diet, obesity, and cardiometabolic risk from young- to mid-adulthood. The proposed research will improve current understanding of the mechanisms through which social environments (specifically broader societal, economic, and environmental contexts) influence health outcomes.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The US is experiencing substantial burden in obesity and cardiometabolic disease, yet very little research has addressed the specific factors and pathways linking the social environment to cardiometabolic risk. The objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of mechanisms through which social environments influence obesity and cardiometabolic risk, determine which factors in the social environment are particularly influential, and to advance analytic methods to understand these complex pathways. Ultimately the proposed research will inform macro-level social environment policies to mitigate early development of disease risk in the early to middle adult years.",Environmental Changes and Health Outcomes across 25 Years: Four US Cities,8336916,R01HL114091,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Body Weight ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Food ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Influentials ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' food resource ', ' improved ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Attenuated ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Height ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' experience ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Dietary intake ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' P30 Grant ', ' P30 Award ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements (P30) ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' food consumption ', ' weight maintenance ', ' environmental change ', ' Outcome ', ' migration ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' biomarker ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2012,574661,0.15725144388468565
"Dietary Inflammatory Index and Risk of Cancer in Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research project to be completed during the proposed pre-doctoral fellowship is focused on the role of long term diet and dietary inflammation in cancer etiology. Given the evidence that dietary factors have either anti- or pro- inflammatory properties, and the idea that no nutrient is consumed alone but in conjunction with other nutrients and non-nutrient components of food, we developed and validated a dietary inflammatory index (DII) to assess the overall quality of diet with regard to its inflammation potential. We recently applied the DII to the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) data and evaluated the association of the DII with three markers of systemic inflammation: high-sensitivity C- reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 2 (TNF¿- 2) at baseline. We inferred from the findings that the FFQ-derived DII is likely to detect significant associations between the inflammatory potential of overall diet and common chronic diseases, including cancer, in the WHI and similar populations of postmenopausal women. Our current objective is to use data from the WHI observational study and clinical trial to: (I) investigate the stability of the DII over time in postmenopausal women, (II) evaluate the association between repeated measures of the DII and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and (III) evaluate the association between repeated measures of the DII and risk of colorectal cancer.  The short terms goals that I will achieve at the end of the training period include the following: (1) an improved mastery of diet assessment methods, including the ability to critically evaluate the epidemiologic literature relative to diet and cancer; (2) an increased understanding of translational issues relevant to cancer prevention and control, including a better understanding of the mechanisms by which diets/dietary patterns predispose to, or prevent cancer. (3) an acquisition of a rich experience in cancer- and nutrition-related racial disparities including the ability to better communicate research findings to both the scientific and lay communities, and (4) an increased participation in many career development activities such as ethics seminars, online courses, preparation and submission of a career development grant to help establish myself as a responsible and productive investigator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence has shown that chronic inflammation is associated with the development of many cancers including breast and colorectal cancers. Motivated by the idea that dietary index or dietary pattern analysis is likely to be more predictiv of disease risk than individual foods or nutrients, we developed and validated the dietary inflammatory index to assess the overall quality of diet with regard to its inflammation potential. The proposed work will elucidate the role of the inflammatory potential of the diet in the long term, on the risk of developing breast and colorectal cancers, and provide insights into more easily translated opportunities for health promotion and cancer prevention, while providing a meaningful

"Spatial and Psychosocial Influences on Food Access in Rural Appalachia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major public health problem in the United States (U.S.). Rural Appalachian residents, especially those living in economically disadvantaged counties, are disproportionately affected by obesity and associated medical conditions. Complex interactions among multiple levels of disadvantage, including individual, family, friends, community, and policy, contribute to unhealthy dietary behaviors that can lead to obesity. Community food environment refers to access and exposure to foods in a community. Potential access to healthy or unhealthy foods depends on spatial availability of food outlets offering different food choices. Realized access, or individual utilization of available foods, ultimately depends on personal, social, and economic factors. However, few studies have examined, from the point of view of rural residents, the opportunities and barriers that influence where they access food and their food choices. This cross-sectional mixed methods study of approximately 20 lower-income women in a rural Appalachian county in Virginia will integrate qualitative interviews, participant observation, geographic information systems (GIS) mapping, and in- store food assessments to examine spatial and psychosocial factors that affect access to food. The research question is: What are some influences on food access and food choices in low-income rural Appalachian residents? The specific aims of this study are to: 1) Describe the community retail food environment (potential food access), including store proximity, food availability, pricing, and marketing; 2) Describe food access behaviors (realized food access); and 3) Explore psychosocial, economic, cultural, and environmental influences on realized food access.  Public health nurses focus on population-level interventions to address health problems. This study supports NINR strategic objectives by improving understanding of complex social and behavioral patterns that relate to prevention of chronic disease in a disadvantaged population, and by applying GIS technology to enhance a community health assessment. The results of this study will inform future analytic studies of food choice and will promote collaborative, inter-professional interventions to improve nutrition and reduce obesity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is one of the most important modifiable causes of disease, disability, and death in the U.S., with disproportionately high rates in rural, Appalachian, and low-income populations. There is increasing evidence that food choices that contribute to obesity are based on complex interactions between individuals, the foods they can access, and the messages about food they receive. In order to design effective obesity interventions for communities, it is important to understand residents' experiences with food access.            ",Spatial and Psychosocial Influences on Food Access in Rural Appalachia,8517412,F31NR013833,"['Affect ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Canned Foods ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Priorities ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Household ', ' Interview ', ' Kentucky ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Maps ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Nurses ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Ohio ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health Nurses ', ' Public Health Nursing ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Tennessee ', ' United States ', ' Virginia ', ' West Virginia ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Businesses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Healthy diet ', ' Diet good ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Characteristics ', ' Community Health ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' obesity prevention ', ' community intervention ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Food Access ', ' Obesity related disease ', ' Obesity associated disease ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' demographics ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,F31,2013,11579,0.31089351364758744
"El Valor de Nuestra Salud (The Value of Our Health) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary intake is an important determinant of risk for obesity and cancer. Consumption of fruits and vegetables reduces risk, yet among Latinos, there is now clear evidence that fruit and vegetable consumption decreases with greater acculturation to the U.S. Interventions targeted at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels of the Socio-Ecological Framework have resulted in changes to dietary intake. However, these studies have neglected to consider that unless changes occur at higher levels of influence (e.g., in stores, in restaurants), individual behavior changes are unlikely to be reinforced and sustained. We propose to refine a pilot-tested intervention to change the food environment of grocery stores to promote consumption of fruits and vegetables. El Valor de Nuestra Salud [The Value of Our Health] will identify, recruit, and match 18 grocery stores (specifically small-to-medium sized Latino grocery stores or tiendas) and randomize them into one of two conditions: intervention versus a no-treatment control condition. The intervention will consist of two communication change strategies and two structural change strategies with the goal of changing aspects of the social and physical environments. The intervention will include employee and manager trainings to promote sales of fruits and vegetables and how to conduct a food marketing campaign. In addition, we will provide equipment and other material resources to the tiendas to promote sales of ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables, and to work with them to modify selections available in the meat and ready-to-eat food departments. Efficacy will be evaluated at the store customer level in terms of baseline to immediate post-intervention (6 months post-baseline) changes in self-reported fruit and vegetable intake in a sample of 360 adult store customers, and maintenance of these changes at the 6-month follow-up (12 months post-baseline). Levels of serum carotenoids collected in a 25% subsample of customers will provide evidence for the validity of dietary self- report. Intervention effectiveness will be evaluated at the employee, manager, and store levels using both self-reported and observed methodological approaches. The RE-AIM framework will be used to assess the potential for disseminating the intervention if it results in improvements in customers' dietary intake. This study is responsive to NCI's call for proposals on Diet and Communication, and given the involvement of a Mexican/Mexican-American population, is responsive to NCI's mission to reduce racial/ethnic health disparities. Risk for obesity and certain cancers are higher among U.S. Latinos as compared with non-Latinos. Risk factors for obesity and cancer include not eating enough fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods, and this is particularly pronounced among Latinos who have less access to healthy foods. This study adds to the growing body of research on environmental-level interventions by proposing to work with Latino grocery stores to increase the availability of fruits and vegetables and ultimately impact the diets of its customers.",El Valor de Nuestra Salud (The Value of Our Health),8719357,R01CA140326,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Carotenes and Carotenoids ', ' Carotenoids ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Equipment ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Maintenance ', ' Meat ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Mission ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Production ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sales ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' cancer risk ', ' success ', ' energy balance ', ' cohort ', ' Employee ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' neglect ', ' food advertising ', ' food ads ', ' food marketing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' obesity risk ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' arm ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NCI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,24899,0.13631033777614965
"Appalachians Together Restoring the Eating Environment (APPAL-TREE)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): identified as a key priority population by the NIMHD, the Appalachian counties of Kentucky suffer from some of the nation's highest rates of obesity and overweight, lowest rates of produce consumption, and high rates of premature mortality and diet-related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and various cancers. With the main partnership of three community-based organizations - the Community Farm Alliance (a community development organization designed to improve food production systems). Faith Moves Mountains (a community-based research team with ten years of culturally-based intervention experience), and the Big Sandy Area Development District (a well-respected network that plans, promotes, and coordinates programs for regional economic, health, and social development of Appalachia) - and with extensive input from the Community Advisory Board (CAB), faith partners, and Cooperative Extension, this community-academic partnership proposes to address the most modifiable risk factor for these main causes of morbidity and mortality: suboptimal diet. In this three-year planning grant, the community-academic collaboration will undertake three specific aims and associated activities. In Aim 1, the project team will conduct a community needs assessment and assets inventory, hold community forums to present this information, and meet regularly with the community partners and CAB. The nutrition and agricultural economic co-investigators will partner with the community research team to use innovative and established methods, including GIS mapping, focus groups, and nutritional and economic assessment techniques. In Aim 2, community forums, CAB meetings, and collaborative engagement sessions among project partners will facilitate the selection and initiation of an evidence-based pilot intervention to promote better nutrition, emphasizing food access, particularly fruits and vegetables. In Aim 3, the community-academic collaborative will implement and evaluate this pilot intervention, tracking nutritional outcomes, participant satisfaction, and costs and reporting results to Appalachian community members.         RELEVANCE: By addressing one of the nation's leading public health challenges - poor diet leading to overweight/obesity and subsequent health impacts - in a region (Appalachian Kentucky) suffering extreme disparities in diet and diet-related disease, this project will develop implement, and evaluate a comprehensive approach to dietary change by increasing access to healthy foods.              ",Appalachians Together Restoring the Eating Environment (APPAL-TREE),8500613,R24MD008018,"['agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Americas ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Kentucky ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Development ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' farmer ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' satisfaction ', ' Collaborations ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' meetings ', ' Farm ', ' Farming environment ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' risk perception ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Food Safety ', ' Advocate ', ' Improve Access ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' evidence base ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R24,2013,357126,0.15746832618599507
"Snacking in young children: parental definitions, goals, and feeding practices     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Snacking is suspected to contribute to excessive energy intake among young children.  The family is a fundamental context for understanding how children's snacking habits develop.  Yet, no studies have examined parenting effects on children's snacking behaviors for low-income ethnic minority families who are at particular risk of food insecurity, poor diet quality, and obesity.  Research on snacking has been hindered by the lack of an accepted, empirically-based definition of snacking.  Focusing on low-income African American  and Hispanic families with preschool-aged children, this study will: qualitatively describe parents' definitions of  child snacking and their approaches to feeding children snacks (Aim 1)~ rigorously develop and test a  quantitative measure of these constructs (Aim 2)~ and evaluate relationships between parenting specific to  child snacking and (a) parents' general child feeding practices and styles (b) children's nutrition and weight- related outcomes (Aim 3). This study will advance basic and translational science on parenting and child snacking through real-world empirical characterization of snacking from parents' perspective and development of the first validated measure of parents' snacking-specific feeding practices. Our interdisciplinary research team includes experts in children's nutrition and child feeding, theories of parenting and food schemas, and qualitative and quantitative methods.  Innovations of the proposed research include the first empirical description of parents' definitions of child snacking and thei associated feeding approaches, the integration of research on food schemas and child-feeding, and the focus on snacking in low-income ethnic-minority children who are at disproportionate risk of poor nutrition and obesity.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is the first comprehensive investigation of low-income ethnic minority parents' definitions, goals, and feeding practices specific to children's snacking.

"Self-Regulation as a Biological Mechanism for Excess Weight Gain in Toddlers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor biobehavioral self-regulation likely contributes to a number of unhealthy behaviors as individuals seek and consume substances that improve self-regulation at a neurobiological level. Poor self-regulation begins very early in the lifespan, at a time when food is the only accessible substance with biological properties that aid the individual's ability to self-regulate. Children with poor self-regulation may therefore be more likely to tantrum for food, overeat and become overweight. There have been no studies to date integrating knowledge of biobehavioral self-regulation with eating behavior, dietary intake and weight status in early childhood. The study team was awarded a Challenge Grant in 2009 to examine some of these associations in low-income 3- to 5-year-olds, and the preliminary results of this project already demonstrate robust associations between aberrant diurnal salivary cortisol patterns, food-related tantrums, and overweight, beginning at age 36 months. In this low-income population, 40 percent of the children are already overweight by age 36 months, and a significant increase in overweight prevalence seems to occur around age 24 months. This application, therefore, proposes to collect measures of salivary cortisol and alpha amylase, self-regulation, eating behavior, diet, and anthropometry from 250 low-income children longitudinally at ages 21, 27, and 33 months. The study will provide more in-depth measures of these constructs from a younger cohort than has ever previously been studied, and in the low-income demographic that is at very high risk for both poor biobehavioral self-regulation and obesity. Structural equation modeling will be used to examine these potential associations. The aims are to examine, among low-income toddlers longitudinally: (1) the relative contributions of food-related self-regulation, non-food related self-regulation, and salivary cortisol and alpha amylase to preference for comfort foods, emotional eating behavior, and weight status, and to determine if these relationships differ across ages 21, 27, and 33 months; (2) relationships between biobehavioral markers of self-regulation at 21 months with changes in weight status between 21 and 33 months, mediated by preference for comfort foods and emotional eating; (3) trajectories of the development of behavioral self-regulation, and to determine if these trajectories are associated with differences in preference for comfort foods, emotional eating behavior, and weight status at 33 months, independent of physiological markers of self-regulation at baseline. The results of this study will have implications for understanding biobehavioral mechanisms of excessive weight gain in toddlerhood, and thereby potentially contribute to more effective, novel, targeted prevention approaches. The results will also improve the understanding of contributors to health disparities based on socioeconomic status and may also have broad implications for the prevention of a wide range of unhealthy behaviors associated with difficulties with biobehavioral self-regulation.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor biobehavioral self-regulation is believed to contribute to a number of unhealthy behaviors, including overeating and the development of obesity. Improved understanding of the development of associations between biobehavioral self-regulation, eating behavior, and excessive weight gain beginning in the toddler years may hold promise for novel targets for obesity prevention. Given that obesity and struggles with biobehavioral self-regulation are both more common among low-income children, the work may also hold particular promise for addressing socioeconomic disparities in obesity prevalence. In addition, overeating in toddlerhood may provide an important and unprecedented model for the early development of biobehavioral self-regulation contributing to a range of unhealthy behaviors. The results could therefore be broadly applicable to more effective prevention of other unhealthy behaviors such as substance abuse.

"Pathways from Food Insecurity to Health and Treatment Outcomes in Women with HIV     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected women have higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared to men in the United States (U.S.). An important driver of health disparities and worse outcomes among HIV-infected women is food insecurity, or the inability to access food of sufficient quality or quantity in socially acceptable ways. Food insecurity affects 18 million households in the U.S. (40% of low income households), is more prevalent among women, and affects about half of urban poor HIV-infected individuals. Food insecurity is associated with worse immunologic and virologic outcomes in cross-sectional studies, increased HIV-related morbidity and mortality in longitudinal studies, and increased cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) in cross-sectional studies in the general population. Due to these negative health impacts among HIV-infected individuals, governmental and non-governmental organizations have argued to integrate food security and HIV/AIDS programming activities. A rigorous longitudinal study is urgently needed to quantify the impacts and identify the dominant mechanisms by which food insecurity negatively impacts health in order to improve the effectiveness and reach of food assistance programs and guide their integration with HIV/AIDS programs.  The proposed research assembles experts from medicine, infectious disease, immunology, biostatistics, and nutrition for a 4-year longitudinal study to quantify the impacts and identify the pathways linking food insecurity to HIV treatment and cardiovascular health in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). WIHS is an ongoing, prospective study in the U.S. of 1500 HIV-infected women and 650 non-infected, but at-risk, women. We plan to leverage the detailed HIV treatment and cardiovascular risk measures collected in WIHS to accomplish 3 aims. In aims 1 and 2, we hypothesize that food insecurity will be associated with worse HIV treatment and cardiovascular risk outcomes and that these relationships will be partially mediated by nutritional (food quality/quantity, obesity), mental health (depression, stress), and behavioral (treatment non-adherence, missed appointments) pathways. To accomplish aims 1 and 2, we will add measures of food insecurity, dietary quality, socio-economic status, competing demands between food and medical care, and antiretroviral (ARV) hair levels (a technique we pioneered as an objective measure of ARV adherence) to WIHS. Our analytic approach will be guided by a novel conceptual model that we recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. In aim 3, we hypothesize that food insecurity will be associated with markers of gut microbial translocation (MT), inflammation and immune activation among HIV-infected women, and that this association will be mediated by diet, obesity, and worse HIV control. To accomplish aim 3, we will add measures of gut MT and immune activation for a sub-sample of 250 women on ARV therapy. Our work will be critical to attract funding for this priority issue. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop sustainable solutions to tackle the intersecting challenges of food insecurity and HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality among women in the U.S.          Food insecurity is common among poor women and HIV-infected persons, and has been associated with more illness, higher risk of heart disease, and quicker decline to AIDS and death. The proposed study brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts for a 4-year study among over 2000 women to answer two key unresolved questions, namely ""What is the magnitude of the impact of food security on health?"" and ""Which mechanisms drive this impact?"" This research will be critical to a) help increase funding for the integration of HIV and nutrition programs in the U.S. and elsewhere; b) select among the various programmatic options for improving food insecurity among HIV-infected women; and c) improve the reach and effectiveness of existing supplemental nutritional assistance programs.

"Self-Regulation as a Biological Mechanism for Excess Weight Gain in Toddlers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor biobehavioral self-regulation likely contributes to a number of unhealthy behaviors as individuals seek and consume substances that improve self-regulation at a neurobiological level. Poor self-regulation begins very early in the lifespan, at a time when food is the only accessible substance with biological properties that aid the individual's ability to self-regulate. Children with poor self-regulation may therefore be more likely to tantrum for food, overeat and become overweight. There have been no studies to date integrating knowledge of biobehavioral self-regulation with eating behavior, dietary intake and weight status in early childhood. The study team was awarded a Challenge Grant in 2009 to examine some of these associations in low-income 3- to 5-year-olds, and the preliminary results of this project already demonstrate robust associations between aberrant diurnal salivary cortisol patterns, food-related tantrums, and overweight, beginning at age 36 months. In this low-income population, 40 percent of the children are already overweight by age 36 months, and a significant increase in overweight prevalence seems to occur around age 24 months. This application, therefore, proposes to collect measures of salivary cortisol and alpha amylase, self-regulation, eating behavior, diet, and anthropometry from 250 low-income children longitudinally at ages 21, 27, and 33 months. The study will provide more in-depth measures of these constructs from a younger cohort than has ever previously been studied, and in the low-income demographic that is at very high risk for both poor biobehavioral self-regulation and obesity. Structural equation modeling will be used to examine these potential associations. The aims are to examine, among low-income toddlers longitudinally: (1) the relative contributions of food-related self-regulation, non-food related self-regulation, and salivary cortisol and alpha amylase to preference for comfort foods, emotional eating behavior, and weight status, and to determine if these relationships differ across ages 21, 27, and 33 months; (2) relationships between biobehavioral markers of self-regulation at 21 months with changes in weight status between 21 and 33 months, mediated by preference for comfort foods and emotional eating; (3) trajectories of the development of behavioral self-regulation, and to determine if these trajectories are associated with differences in preference for comfort foods, emotional eating behavior, and weight status at 33 months, independent of physiological markers of self-regulation at baseline. The results of this study will have implications for understanding biobehavioral mechanisms of excessive weight gain in toddlerhood, and thereby potentially contribute to more effective, novel, targeted prevention approaches. The results will also improve the understanding of contributors to health disparities based on socioeconomic status and may also have broad implications for the prevention of a wide range of unhealthy behaviors associated with difficulties with biobehavioral self-regulation.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor biobehavioral self-regulation is believed to contribute to a number of unhealthy behaviors, including overeating and the development of obesity. Improved understanding of the development of associations between biobehavioral self-regulation, eating behavior, and excessive weight gain beginning in the toddler years may hold promise for novel targets for obesity prevention. Given that obesity and struggles with biobehavioral self-regulation are both more common among low-income children, the work may also hold particular promise for addressing socioeconomic disparities in obesity prevalence. In addition, overeating in toddlerhood may provide an important and unprecedented model for the early development of biobehavioral self-regulation contributing to a range of unhealthy behaviors. The results could therefore be broadly applicable to more effective prevention of other unhealthy behaviors such as substance abuse.

"El Valor de Nuestra Salud (The Value of Our Health)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary intake is an important determinant of risk for obesity and cancer. Consumption of fruits and vegetables reduces risk, yet among Latinos, there is now clear evidence that fruit and vegetable consumption decreases with greater acculturation to the U.S. Interventions targeted at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels of the Socio-Ecological Framework have resulted in changes to dietary intake. However, these studies have neglected to consider that unless changes occur at higher levels of influence (e.g., in stores, in restaurants), individual behavior changes are unlikely to be reinforced and sustained. We propose to refine a pilot-tested intervention to change the food environment of grocery stores to promote consumption of fruits and vegetables. El Valor de Nuestra Salud [The Value of Our Health] will identify, recruit, and match 18 grocery stores (specifically small-to-medium sized Latino grocery stores or tiendas) and randomize them into one of two conditions: intervention versus a no-treatment control condition. The intervention will consist of two communication change strategies and two structural change strategies with the goal of changing aspects of the social and physical environments. The intervention will include employee and manager trainings to promote sales of fruits and vegetables and how to conduct a food marketing campaign. In addition, we will provide equipment and other material resources to the tiendas to promote sales of ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables, and to work with them to modify selections available in the meat and ready-to-eat food departments. Efficacy will be evaluated at the store customer level in terms of baseline to immediate post-intervention (6 months post-baseline) changes in self-reported fruit and vegetable intake in a sample of 360 adult store customers, and maintenance of these changes at the 6-month follow-up (12 months post-baseline). Levels of serum carotenoids collected in a 25% subsample of customers will provide evidence for the validity of dietary self- report. Intervention effectiveness will be evaluated at the employee, manager, and store levels using both self-reported and observed methodological approaches. The RE-AIM framework will be used to assess the potential for disseminating the intervention if it results in improvements in customers' dietary intake. This study is responsive to NCI's call for proposals on Diet and Communication, and given the involvement of a Mexican/Mexican-American population, is responsive to NCI's mission to reduce racial/ethnic health disparities.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Risk for obesity and certain cancers are higher among U.S. Latinos as compared with non-Latinos. Risk factors for obesity and cancer include not eating enough fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods, and this is particularly pronounced among Latinos who have less access to healthy foods. This study adds to the growing body of research on environmental-level interventions by proposing to work with Latino grocery stores to increase the availability of fruits and vegetables and ultimately impact the diets of its customers.

"Food Environment, Diet Quality and Disparities in Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle Obesity Study (S.O.S) seeks to explain why obesity rates are more prevalent among some racial/ethnic minorities, population subgroups of lower education and incomes, and in high-poverty areas. The study will recruit a longitudinal cohort of 400 male and female adults, ages 21-65y, and resident in Seattle-King County and stratified by income and race/ethnicity, using an address-based sampling scheme. Data on food seeking behavior will be collected using a combination of self report and objective measures. At the first in- person interview, participants will complete a behavior survey module on food shopping and dietary habits, estimated food expenditures, nutrition literacy, attitudes towards diet and health, demographics, and health status. Health-related questions will address obesity, diabetes, stress, and cardiovascular disease. Height, weight, and waist circumference will be measured. A GPS receiver with data logging capability will be used to track the participants' movements and to record the time and location of all food-related events for 1 wk. Food store and restaurant receipts, stamped with time and date, will be collected for 4 wks. Foods brought into the home will be scanned with a portable UPC scanner for 4 wks. Three 24-h food recalls will be administered by phone in wks 3 and 4, and food frequency questionnaires will be administered in week 4 of data collection. To be able to establish causality between environmental and dietary variables and health outcomes, the behavior survey module and the food frequency questionnaire will be re-administered during a follow up visit 18 months later and anthropometric measures will be collected for the second time. Data on foods purchased for use at home and foods consumed away from home will be linked to individual-level metrics of the built environment based on tax parcel data. The main aim of the study is to assess the impact of SEP, environmental, and dietary variables on obesity and body weight gain. The hypothesis is that low dietary quality and low diet cost will be associated with prevalent obesity and will predict 18 mo. weight gain, adjusting for SEP. This model will be built on data collected and validated under Aims 2 and 3. The second aim will be to assess how access to food sources (both physical and economic), retail outlet choice, and food purchases impact diet quality across SEP strata. The hypothesis is that diet quality will be influenced strongly by price and other economic variables than by proximity to food sources. The third aim will be to validate self-reported data on food acquisition and expenditures against objective measures of individual behavior in space and time. The hypothesis is that objective measures of food purchase behaviors based on GPS logs, food store and restaurant receipts, and UPC scanner data will provide new insights into the energy and nutrient content of foods that are acquired at different locations. Study results have the potential of informing local and national policies on improving retail access to affordable healthy foods by vulnerable groups.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A better understanding of factors that may explain social disparities in diet quality and chronic diseases is critical. The proposed longitudinal study seeks to explain the role of built environment, economics, psychosocial factors, SEP and demographics on food seeking behaviors, diet quality, obesity and body weight gain.

"Temporal Trends in Food Sensitization in U.S. Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food allergy appears to have risen rapidly in prevalence over the past few decades, leading to much research into the causes of this apparent 'epidemic'. Yet, because the data showing increased prevalence are largely based on questionnaires, and we know that questionnaires overestimate clinically confirmed food allergy, we truly do not know how real the apparent epidemic is. It is possible that the increased prevalence seen in the questionnaires represents changes in the diagnosis of food allergy, and that biologic markers of this disease remain unchanged. An additional unknown is whether the growing ethnic/racial disparities in food allergy prevalence seen in the self-reported data relate to true biologic differences. In order to determine whether the trends that are found in self reported food allergy correlate with changes in biologic measures of food allergy, we propose to measure food specific IgE in stored samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III, collected from 1988-1994, in order to compare it to that already measured in NHANES 2005-6. Aim 1 is to compare the prevalence of sensitization and higher likelihood of clinical food allergy, both as measured by specific IgE to milk, egg, peanut or shrimp, in U.S. children over this approximately 15 year period. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that Non-Hispanic Blacks have experienced greater increases in prevalence of sensitization and higher specific IgE over this period. Combined, these aims will answer fundamental questions in the field of food allergy epidemiology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is to measure food specific IgE in the surplus sera from a nationally representative survey from obtained from 1988-1994, in order to compare it to specific IgE from a later survey.

"Pathways from Food Insecurity to Health and Treatment Outcomes in Women with HIV     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected women have higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared to men in the United States (U.S.). An important driver of health disparities and worse outcomes among HIV-infected women is food insecurity, or the inability to access food of sufficient quality or quantity in socially acceptable ways. Food insecurity affects 18 million households in the U.S. (40% of low income households), is more prevalent among women, and affects about half of urban poor HIV-infected individuals. Food insecurity is associated with worse immunologic and virologic outcomes in cross-sectional studies, increased HIV-related morbidity and mortality in longitudinal studies, and increased cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) in cross-sectional studies in the general population. Due to these negative health impacts among HIV-infected individuals, governmental and non-governmental organizations have argued to integrate food security and HIV/AIDS programming activities. A rigorous longitudinal study is urgently needed to quantify the impacts and identify the dominant mechanisms by which food insecurity negatively impacts health in order to improve the effectiveness and reach of food assistance programs and guide their integration with HIV/AIDS programs.  The proposed research assembles experts from medicine, infectious disease, immunology, biostatistics, and nutrition for a 4-year longitudinal study to quantify the impacts and identify the pathways linking food insecurity to HIV treatment and cardiovascular health in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). WIHS is an ongoing, prospective study in the U.S. of 1500 HIV-infected women and 650 non-infected, but at-risk, women. We plan to leverage the detailed HIV treatment and cardiovascular risk measures collected in WIHS to accomplish 3 aims. In aims 1 and 2, we hypothesize that food insecurity will be associated with worse HIV treatment and cardiovascular risk outcomes and that these relationships will be partially mediated by nutritional (food quality/quantity, obesity), mental health (depression, stress), and behavioral (treatment non-adherence, missed appointments) pathways. To accomplish aims 1 and 2, we will add measures of food insecurity, dietary quality, socio-economic status, competing demands between food and medical care, and antiretroviral (ARV) hair levels (a technique we pioneered as an objective measure of ARV adherence) to WIHS. Our analytic approach will be guided by a novel conceptual model that we recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. In aim 3, we hypothesize that food insecurity will be associated with markers of gut microbial translocation (MT), inflammation and immune activation among HIV-infected women, and that this association will be mediated by diet, obesity, and worse HIV control. To accomplish aim 3, we will add measures of gut MT and immune activation for a sub-sample of 250 women on ARV therapy. Our work will be critical to attract funding for this priority issue. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop sustainable solutions to tackle the intersecting challenges of food insecurity and HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality among women in the U.S.          Food insecurity is common among poor women and HIV-infected persons, and has been associated with more illness, higher risk of heart disease, and quicker decline to AIDS and death. The proposed study brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts for a 4-year study among over 2000 women to answer two key unresolved questions, namely ""What is the magnitude of the impact of food security on health?"" and ""Which mechanisms drive this impact?"" This research will be critical to a) help increase funding for the integration of HIV and nutrition programs in the U.S. and elsewhere; b) select among the various programmatic options for improving food insecurity among HIV-infected women; and c) improve the reach and effectiveness of existing supplemental nutritional assistance programs.

"Race, Socioeconomic Status, Diet and Chronic Kidney Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are most profound among persons of low socioeconomic status (SES), and dietary factors (limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy dietary patterns) likely underlie much of this disparit. Low SES African Americans (AAs) are more likely to experience food insecurity (the inability to afford nutritionally adequate and safe foods) and live in ""food deserts"" (areas where low-income residents do not have access to healthy food and fast food restaurants predominate) which likely contributes to racial differences in dietary patterns. Little is known regarding the potentil effectiveness of dietary interventions among low SES AAs at high risk for CKD incidence or progression. Studies quantifying the association between poor diet and disparities in CKD incidence and progression among low SES AAs and identifying effective strategies to improve dietary habits in this population are critically needed, and could lead to reduced racial disparitis in CKD. The overall objectives of this proposal are to 1) determine the contribution of racial differences in dietary patterns to racial disparities in progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) among low SES individuals in a national population-based study; 2) examine the impact of availability of healthy foods on the effectiveness of a patient, family and community level intervention among low SES AAs with uncontrolled hypertension by using established measures and developing a novel measure of healthy food availability within AAs' homes; 3) identify perceived barriers to healthy dietary patterns and identify potential interventional strategies deemed acceptable among low SES AAs at very high risk for CKD using qualitative methodology; and 4) develop and pilot-test a tailored dietary intervention for low SES AAs at very high risk for CKD by employing the principles of community-based participatory research. The candidate for this K23 Mentored Career Development Award, Dr. Deidra Crews, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Nephrology at Johns Hopkins University and an Associate Faculty Member at the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research. Her long term goal is to improve health outcomes among vulnerable populations through her work as a clinical investigator. The overarching goal of this application is to establish her successful and independent career studying mechanisms to narrow racial disparities in CKD. Under the guidance of exceptional mentors and advisors, Dr. Crews will extend her prior training and work in clinical epidemiology and health disparities research through further didactic training in nutrition, clinical trials and community-based participatory research, and through the performance of novel, complementary studies. She will conduct this work in the rich training environment of the Welch Center, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the Hopkins Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Health Disparities. Dr. Crews' proposed work will not only assure her successful transition to an R01-funded independent investigator, but will also contribute substantially to what is known about racial and socioeconomic disparities in CKD.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are disproportionately affected by chronic kidney disease in the United States, and this disparity is particularly apparent among socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans. Limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy dietary patterns likely contribute to this disparity, and represent modifiable targets fo the prevention of chronic kidney disease in this population.        ","Race, Socioeconomic Status, Diet and Chronic Kidney Disease",8424489,K23DK097184,"['Dietary Factors ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' hypertension control ', ' Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet ', ' DASH diet ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Center for Health Statistics ', ' National Center for Health Statistics ', ' NCHS ', ' National Center for Health Statistics (U.S.) ', ' Nephrology ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Diet Habits ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' Funding ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' member ', ' Study Subject ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,172023,0.04814115658787164
"Neural Correlates of Food Reward in American Indian Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 award will allow Dr. Beckman, the first American Indian (AI) adult endocrinologist in the nation, to become an investigator proficient in interdisciplinary research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the causes of obesity. She has a career interest in the neuropsychology of obesity and diabetes and her focus is on the AI population in Minnesota. Obesity is a major health disparity in AIs, yet litle work is being done to unravel the neurobiology of this problem. The training and research activities will allow her to examine the complexities of computational neuroscience, functional neuroanatomy, and the contribution of opioidergic neurons to brain reward pathways. The application proposes an intensive, 5-year program of mentored research and formal training activities to enhance Dr. Beckman's skills and experience in: 1) clinical research methods and biostatistics, 2) technical aspects of fMRI data acquisition and analysis, and 3) role of opioidergic neurons in the neuroendocrine regulation of appetite. In the long term, Dr. Beckman will apply these translational research skills to study neuromodulation, cognitive restructuring, and opioid antagonists as potentially effective treatments for the public health problem of obesity in her AI patients who may be hyperresponsive to environmentally rewarding food cues.  The research component of this career development award targets the neurobiology of behavioral responses to food in 60 AIs. The specific aims are to: 1) use fMRI to compare brain activation associated with the response to visual food cues in obese versus lean AI women, 2) use fMRI to compare the effects of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, versus placebo, on brain activation associated with response to palatable food cues, 3) compare the effects of naltrexone versus placebo on food intake in obese and lean AI women, by measuring calories consumed.  The University of Minnesota is an exceptional environment for Dr. Beckman to gain the skills needed to achieve her goals. The training component uses academic resources including the Division of Diabetes, Metabolism, and Endocrinology, Minnesota Obesity Center, Center for the Study of Impulsivity in Addiction, Center for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Clinical and Translational Science Institute. Dr. Beckman's mentors are highly regarded scientists in the areas of obesity, addiction, and neuroimaging.          Despite the disproportionate obesity burden among AIs, this will be the first study using fMRI and an opioid antagonist to focus on this underrepresented population. Our results will provide important data about brain activation in response to high-calorie foods that will inform dietary interventions aimed at preventing and treating obesity and may identify a promising pharmacologic treatment for obesity and overeating in AIs.

"SES and race-ethnic disparities in food purchasing and dietary intake:2000-2015     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SES and race-ethnic disparities of food purchasing and dietary intake: 2000-2015 Our primary goals are to use in-depth descriptive and longitudinal analyses of shift in food purchases among critical race/ethnic and SES subpopulations to examine the impact of the Great Recession (beginning in 2007), and other SES factors on short-term and long-term food purchase and dietary outcomes. In addition, we will seek to understand factors determining how our key subpopulations select the consumer packaged goods sector (CPGs) foods and beverages they purchase and how this affects their nutrient intake. Food purchase and dietary outcomes include nutritional quality (calories, sodium, saturated fat and added sugars), and patterns (focusing on selected subgroups of foods considered to contain large proportions of empty calories, and away-from-home intakes). Using data purchased under separate funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), the UNC Food Research Program (UNCFRP) has created a longitudinal file of Nielsen Homescan household purchase data from 2000-2012, and we propose to expand this work to later years and additional analyses under this grant. We examine a number of key issues related to the diets of key minority (Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites) and lower income subpopulations. We will use longitudinal commercial data on CPG food and beverage purchases by a nationally representative sample of 35,000 to 60,000 households in each quarter linked with nutrition facts panel data at the barcode level. With a unique crosswalk, we link these commercial data to the publicly available What We Eat in America (WWEIA) dietary intake interview component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) and the US Department of Agriculture nutrient databases. We will implement established linear programming methods to estimate added sugar content of all commercial CPG products (706,451 items in 2000-10 alone). We use longitudinal methods, correct for endogeneity in selection of various types of stores (convenience, grocery, mass merchandisers/supercenters, and warehouse/club stores), account for dynamics in market shares of branded vs. private label products, and examine other issues relevant to dynamics of food purchase and diet among race-ethnic, age and income subpopulations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to evaluate how an array of economic changes, including the Great Recession, may have differentially affected the nutrient composition of consumer package foods and beverages purchases from various categories of food stores, branded vs. private label brands by critical subpopulations. In addition, we will link these changes to individual dietary intake changes in national dietary intake to understand what these changes mean for trends and patterns in access to and intake of key foods and nutrients. The entire focus is on explaining differences within and between major race-ethnic-income-age subpopulations.                ",SES and race-ethnic disparities in food purchasing and dietary intake:2000-2015,8466398,R01DK098072,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Americas ', ' Behavior ', ' Beverages ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' Maps ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Product Labeling ', ' Linear Programming ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vendor ', ' Wood ', ' Wood material ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Department of Agriculture (U.S.) ', ' United States Department of Agriculture ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Food Packaging ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' saturated fat ', ' Nutrient ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' food supply surveillance ', ' food supply monitoring ', ' food monitoring ', ' food surveillance ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Macronutrients ', ' Macronutrients Nutrition ', ' Update ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' trend ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' public health relevance ', ' health inequalities ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2013,357997,0.283185842301144
"Environmental Changes and Health Outcomes across 25 Years: Four US Cities  ABSTRACT While observational research suggests an association between obesity-related social environment factors with obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors, very little research has addressed the specific factors and pathways linking the social environment to cardiometabolic risk. The primary reasons for this lack of research are: 1) lack of high quality data on diet, activity, measured height and weight over time linked to cardiometabolic risk biomarkers; 2) lack of fine-grain longitudinal data on the introduction, renovation, and closure of food- and activity-related environmental features; and 3) lack of complex statistical models examining each piece of the time-dependent, complex system, accounting for the process by which food, activity, and transportation facilities are established and expanded and the potential for individuals to selectively migrate to locate near such facilities. The 25-year, longitudinal Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study provides a wide age range, high quality longitudinal, biological, behavioral and anthropometry and biomarker data of CARDIA, geographic diversity, and different patterns and pace of change across the four baseline cities: Birmingham, Chicago, Minneapolis and Oakland. The research team has developed a unique method to use retrospective and contemporary sources to create data on the timing and placement of introductions, renovations, and closures of: 1) food resources (e.g., restaurants, food shopping); 2) recreation facilities (e.g., trails, parks); and 3) transportation infrastructure (e.g., light rail, bike parking, bike paths) in Birmingham, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Oakland over a 25-year period. Furthermore, we have developed sophisticated statistical models that account for purposeful (as opposed to random) placement of relevant resources in the social environment as well as individuals' ability to selectively migrate to locate near such resources. Study objectives include: 1) Develop and validate new fine-grain measures to capture introductions, renovations, and closures representing changes in: a) parks, trails, and other recreational sites; b) food environments; and c) transportation infrastructure that will be contemporaneously linked to CARDIA respondents' geographic locations over 25 years; and 2) Using this unique data source, estimate the effects of introductions, renovations, and closures of key food and activity facilities and transportation infrastructure on diet and activity behaviors, body weight and cardiometabolic risk in the four field cities over 25 years, while accounting for the endogenous placement of food and activity facilities and selective migration. We will specifically focus on comparisons across individual-level race, income, and education groups to examine how environmental factors contribute to race and SES inequalities in diet, obesity, and cardiometabolic risk from young- to mid-adulthood. The proposed research will improve current understanding of the mechanisms through which social environments (specifically broader societal, economic, and environmental contexts) influence health outcomes.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The US is experiencing substantial burden in obesity and cardiometabolic disease, yet very little research has addressed the specific factors and pathways linking the social environment to cardiometabolic risk. The objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of mechanisms through which social environments influence obesity and cardiometabolic risk, determine which factors in the social environment are particularly influential, and to advance analytic methods to understand these complex pathways.

"The Intra-household Distribution of Food and Health Resources amongst Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Policies targeting health improvements for particular household members can, as a result of resource allocation adjustments, have repercussions for all household members. Understanding how these spillovers work within the household could enable the design of smarter health policies which take into account households' optimal readjustments. But we cannot fully measure these reallocation responses without data on dietary intake, which is arguably the most important health resource, especially for children in low-income settings. I propose to 1) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to collect such data, and 2) use it to analyze the effects of nutrition interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources.  To accomplish the first goal, I will engage in three training activities which will enable me to learn about key concepts in nutritional science and measurement issues in dietary intake assessment in low-income settings: 1) coursework, 2) mentoring meetings, and 3) dissemination of my work. To accomplish the second, I will engage in a research program related to understanding the intra-household spillovers of targeted nutrition interventions, focusing on iodine supplementation.  Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) has significant and irreversible effects on cognitive development.  One third of the global population has IDD. Low in utero exposure to iodine leads to reduced intelligence quotients, and in severe cases can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery and growth, hearing and speech problems. Iodine supplementation and fortification programs-both in utero and in early childhood-have been proven to increase child health and cognitive ability, and are thus often used as policy tools in affected areas. Supplementation programs are usually targeted towards pregnant women and young children. However, little is known about how these interventions affect other children in the household who are not targeted.  My research program has 3 specific aims: 1) collect novel data which combine socioeconomic and demographic information with dietary intake measurements for every child in the household; 2) document the patterns of intra-household allocation of food and other health resources; and 3) study the effects of fetal and early childhood iodine supplementation interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources amongst children.  I will accomplish the first aim by designing a dietary intake assessment module and integrating it into a large-scale household panel survey in Ghana. I will accomplish Aim 2 by performing preliminary analyses with these new data. I will accomplish the last aim through two studies. In the first, I will study the effects of a large feta iodine supplementation program in Tanzania using an existing, nationally representative dataset. In this study, I will apply econometric techniques developed for intra-household analyses to examine whether children exposed to more iodine while in utero receive more health resources than their untreated siblings during childhood. In the second study, I will implement and analyze data from a pilot field experiment that will distribute iodine supplements to children under 5 in Ghana. The experiment will run concurrently with the panel survey data collection, allowing me to measure the resulting changes in dietary intake and other health resource allocations.  Without quantifying the household responses to childhood nutrition interventions, particularly in the context of iodine supplementation policies, it is impossible to know the full impact of these programs. Answering this question-are we helping or hurting other children in the household through targeted interventions?-is essential to the design and improved cost-benefit analysis of childhood nutrition programs around the world.          It is impossible to gauge the full impacts of childhood nutrition interventions without measuring how households redistribute resources among children in response. Answering this question-are we helping or hurting other children in the household through targeted interventions?-is essential to the design and improved cost-benefit analysis of childhood nutrition programs around the world.

"Influence of Food Insecurity on Adherence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research proposal requests 3 years of support to conduct developmental intervention studies to design and field test a theory-based intervention to address food insecurity and improve antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among men and women living with HIV infection. Food insecurity is prevalent among people living with HIV in US inner-cities, with as many as 43% not having sufficient food and experiencing intermittent hunger. Food insecurity has demonstrated direct associations with ART adherence including predicting non-adherence over and above other factors including depression, social support, and alcohol use. Food insecurity is particularly problematic in relation to substance abuse given competing survival needs and the dire combined health consequences of alcoholism, addiction and malnutrition. Guided by the Conservation of Resources Theory of Stress and Coping, we will conduct 3 stages of intervention development research: (1) initial interviews and focus groups with people living with HIV who take ART, use substances, and experience food insecurity. Based on information gained from rapid formative studies, this first stage of research will be used to develop a theory-based intervention to address accessing food and sustaining ART adherence; (2) Test the feasibility of the newly developed food insecurity and adherence intervention with a small sample of HIV positive men and women who are taking ART, use substances, and experience food insecurity. Stage 2 will also finalize and pilot test all assessment instruments and protocols for data collection; and (3) Conduct a randomized field test to determine the potential efficacy of the food insecurity and ART adherence intervention. Participants in the field test will be randomly assigned to either receive the newly developed intervention or a time matched attention comparison condition. Following a 6- month follow-up period, we will test for differences between groups on ART adherence, food access, nutrition, and coping resource outcomes. The intervention development will include pilot testing daily food, mood, and substance use behaviors monitored by interactive text-message surveys. We will also examine the intervention effects on mediating theoretical constructs derived by Conservation of Resources Theory. Our developmental research will also examine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting the intervention in face-to-face intervention sessions. The proposed intervention research will therefore develop new strategies for use with people living with HIV who are taking ART under adverse conditions with multiple competing needs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lack of access to food and the intermittent experience of hunger are prevalent among people living with HIV in the United States. Effective strategies are urgently needed to assist people living with HIV to access food and sustain long- term medication adherence under the most challenging conditions. This proposal requests support to conduct developmental research to design and field test a theory-based intervention to directly address food insecurity, hunger and poor nutrition as barriers to medication adherence among men and women living with HIV infection in US urban areas.                ",Influence of Food Insecurity on Adherence,8603060,R01AA021471,"['etoh use ', ' ethanol use ',

"Impact of a Public-Private Mobile Market to Improve Fruit & Vegetable Access     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lower-income and minority groups face significant health disparities with respect to obesity, cancer, heart disease and other chronic conditions. Poor diets, low in fruits and vegetables (F&V) and high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar, contribute to many of the health problems faced by vulnerable groups. While poverty, low- educational attainment and personal food preference are all associated with reduced F&V consumption, these individual-level factors must be viewed in an environmental context. Research has repeatedly demonstrated the important role that environment plays on health decisions and behaviors. Compared with higher-income neighborhoods, lower-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to have a supermarket that sells a variety of F&V and other healthy foods. This is perpetuated by an underlying misconception that there is limited demand or potential profit for new healthy food ventures in these communities. In the few cases where new food outlets have opened in underserved areas, they have been met with substantial customer support. The NC Green Cart program hopes to demonstrate that selling affordable, accessible F&V in lower-income communities is not only financially viable, but can impact behavioral risk factors of individuals in target communities. The NC Green Cart program will build on burgeoning support for a local sustainable food system in NC and leverage a public-private partnership to increase access to fresh F&V in underserved communities. Using a weekly mobile market model, the program will deliver low-cost boxes of fresh F&V to easily accessible community locations (such as churches and day care centers) and provide nutrition and cooking education. Working together with the Green Cart team, this project will 1.) measure the impact of a mobile market at 6, 12 and 18 months on the primary outcome of F&V consumption as well as perceived access to F&V and self- efficacy to purchase, prepare, serve and eat fresh F&V using a randomized controlled design; 2.) assess community support, feasibility, and financial sustainability of the public-private Green Cart partnership; and 3.) explore policy-related barriers and facilitators to the public-private Green Cart operation that could influence future growth and dissemination of the model. Results of this research will inform our understanding of how the food environment impacts dietary choices and provide evidence for researchers, businesses, non-profits and policy makers on the potential impact and viability of using similar models to reduce food access disparities and improve diet.          We will measure the impact and sustainability of a public-private mobile market program to increase access to and demand for fresh F&V in underserved communities where F&V consumption is low and obesity and disease rates are high. This research will help elucidate the role the food environment plays in dietary choices of vulnerable groups and may provide evidence of a viable model for improving diet and health by growing local food systems and stimulating business in underserved communities.

"El Valor de Nuestra Salud (The Value of Our Health)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary intake is an important determinant of risk for obesity and cancer. Consumption of fruits and vegetables reduces risk, yet among Latinos, there is now clear evidence that fruit and vegetable consumption decreases with greater acculturation to the U.S. Interventions targeted at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels of the Socio-Ecological Framework have resulted in changes to dietary intake. However, these studies have neglected to consider that unless changes occur at higher levels of influence (e.g., in stores, in restaurants), individual behavior changes are unlikely to be reinforced and sustained. We propose to refine a pilot-tested intervention to change the food environment of grocery stores to promote consumption of fruits and vegetables. El Valor de Nuestra Salud [The Value of Our Health] will identify, recruit, and match 18 grocery stores (specifically small-to-medium sized Latino grocery stores or tiendas) and randomize them into one of two conditions: intervention versus a no-treatment control condition. The intervention will consist of two communication change strategies and two structural change strategies with the goal of changing aspects of the social and physical environments. The intervention will include employee and manager trainings to promote sales of fruits and vegetables and how to conduct a food marketing campaign. In addition, we will provide equipment and other material resources to the tiendas to promote sales of ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables, and to work with them to modify selections available in the meat and ready-to-eat food departments. Efficacy will be evaluated at the store customer level in terms of baseline to immediate post-intervention (6 months post-baseline) changes in self-reported fruit and vegetable intake in a sample of 360 adult store customers, and maintenance of these changes at the 6-month follow-up (12 months post-baseline). Levels of serum carotenoids collected in a 25% subsample of customers will provide evidence for the validity of dietary self- report. Intervention effectiveness will be evaluated at the employee, manager, and store levels using both self-reported and observed methodological approaches. The RE-AIM framework will be used to assess the potential for disseminating the intervention if it results in improvements in customers' dietary intake. This study is responsive to NCI's call for proposals on Diet and Communication, and given the involvement of a Mexican/Mexican-American population, is responsive to NCI's mission to reduce racial/ethnic health disparities.

"Self-Regulation as a Biological Mechanism for Excess Weight Gain in Toddlers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor biobehavioral self-regulation likely contributes to a number of unhealthy behaviors as individuals seek and consume substances that improve self-regulation at a neurobiological level. Poor self-regulation begins very early in the lifespan, at a time when food is the only accessible substance with biological properties that aid the individual's ability to self-regulate. Children with poor self-regulation may therefore be more likely to tantrum for food, overeat and become overweight. There have been no studies to date integrating knowledge of biobehavioral self-regulation with eating behavior, dietary intake and weight status in early childhood. The study team was awarded a Challenge Grant in 2009 to examine some of these associations in low-income 3- to 5-year-olds, and the preliminary results of this project already demonstrate robust associations between aberrant diurnal salivary cortisol patterns, food-related tantrums, and overweight, beginning at age 36 months. In this low-income population, 40 percent of the children are already overweight by age 36 months, and a significant increase in overweight prevalence seems to occur around age 24 months. This application, therefore, proposes to collect measures of salivary cortisol and alpha amylase, self-regulation, eating behavior, diet, and anthropometry from 250 low-income children longitudinally at ages 21, 27, and 33 months. The study will provide more in-depth measures of these constructs from a younger cohort than has ever previously been studied, and in the low-income demographic that is at very high risk for both poor biobehavioral self-regulation and obesity. Structural equation modeling will be used to examine these potential associations. The aims are to examine, among low-income toddlers longitudinally: (1) the relative contributions of food-related self-regulation, non-food related self-regulation, and salivary cortisol and alpha amylase to preference for comfort foods, emotional eating behavior, and weight status, and to determine if these relationships differ across ages 21, 27, and 33 months; (2) relationships between biobehavioral markers of self-regulation at 21 months with changes in weight status between 21 and 33 months, mediated by preference for comfort foods and emotional eating; (3) trajectories of the development of behavioral self-regulation, and to determine if these trajectories are associated with differences in preference for comfort foods, emotional eating behavior, and weight status at 33 months, independent of physiological markers of self-regulation at baseline. The results of this study will have implications for understanding biobehavioral mechanisms of excessive weight gain in toddlerhood, and thereby potentially contribute to more effective, novel, targeted prevention approaches. The results will also improve the understanding of contributors to health disparities based on socioeconomic status and may also have broad implications for the prevention of a wide range of unhealthy behaviors associated with difficulties with biobehavioral self-regulation.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor biobehavioral self-regulation is believed to contribute to a number of unhealthy behaviors, including overeating and the development of obesity. Improved understanding of the development of associations between biobehavioral self-regulation, eating behavior, and excessive weight gain beginning in the toddler years may hold promise for novel targets for obesity prevention. Given that obesity and struggles with biobehavioral self-regulation are both more common among low-income children, the work may also hold particular promise for addressing socioeconomic disparities in obesity prevalence. In addition, overeating in toddlerhood may provide an important and unprecedented model for the early development of biobehavioral self-regulation contributing to a range of unhealthy behaviors. The results could therefore be broadly applicable to more effective prevention of other unhealthy behaviors such as substance abuse.

"Food Environment, Diet Quality and Disparities in Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seattle Obesity Study (S.O.S) seeks to explain why obesity rates are more prevalent among some racial/ethnic minorities, population subgroups of lower education and incomes, and in high-poverty areas. The study will recruit a longitudinal cohort of 400 male and female adults, ages 21-65y, and resident in Seattle-King County and stratified by income and race/ethnicity, using an address-based sampling scheme. Data on food seeking behavior will be collected using a combination of self report and objective measures. At the first in- person interview, participants will complete a behavior survey module on food shopping and dietary habits, estimated food expenditures, nutrition literacy, attitudes towards diet and health, demographics, and health status. Health-related questions will address obesity, diabetes, stress, and cardiovascular disease. Height, weight, and waist circumference will be measured. A GPS receiver with data logging capability will be used to track the participants' movements and to record the time and location of all food-related events for 1 wk. Food store and restaurant receipts, stamped with time and date, will be collected for 4 wks. Foods brought into the home will be scanned with a portable UPC scanner for 4 wks. Three 24-h food recalls will be administered by phone in wks 3 and 4, and food frequency questionnaires will be administered in week 4 of data collection. To be able to establish causality between environmental and dietary variables and health outcomes, the behavior survey module and the food frequency questionnaire will be re-administered during a follow up visit 18 months later and anthropometric measures will be collected for the second time. Data on foods purchased for use at home and foods consumed away from home will be linked to individual-level metrics of the built environment based on tax parcel data. The main aim of the study is to assess the impact of SEP, environmental, and dietary variables on obesity and body weight gain. The hypothesis is that low dietary quality and low diet cost will be associated with prevalent obesity and will predict 18 mo. weight gain, adjusting for SEP. This model will be built on data collected and validated under Aims 2 and 3. The second aim will be to assess how access to food sources (both physical and economic), retail outlet choice, and food purchases impact diet quality across SEP strata. The hypothesis is that diet quality will be influenced strongly by price and other economic variables than by proximity to food sources. The third aim will be to validate self-reported data on food acquisition and expenditures against objective measures of individual behavior in space and time. The hypothesis is that objective measures of food purchase behaviors based on GPS logs, food store and restaurant receipts, and UPC scanner data will provide new insights into the energy and nutrient content of foods that are acquired at different locations. Study results have the potential of informing local and national policies on improving retail access to affordable healthy foods by vulnerable groups.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A better understanding of factors that may explain social disparities in diet quality and chronic diseases is critical. The proposed longitudinal study seeks to explain the role of built environment, economics, psychosocial factors, SEP and demographics on food seeking behaviors, diet quality, obesity and body weight gain. This interdisciplinary project on the built environment, behavior and health brings together experts from nutrition, geography, epidemiology, medicine, statistics and urban design.

"The Impact of Healthy Food Marketing Strategies In Supermarkets     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the prevalence of obesity has increased, public health experts have increasingly focused on the environments that shape overeating and unhealthy food choices. Retail grocery stores are pivotally positioned to influence choices and favorably affect energy balance. Greater availability of healthier foods, if translated to health-promoting purchases, can positively affect diet quality among those at greatest risk for obesity- low-income, ethnic minorities.  The aims of the proposed study are:  1. To evaluate, in a cluster randomized controlled trial design, effects of in-store healthy food  marketing strategies on sales and purchase of healthier items in six product categories  (milk, frozen entrees, beverage checkout coolers, bread, salty snacks and cheese); and  2. To evaluate the association of changes in supermarket food marketing environments with  changes in sales of specific healthier food items in the same six product categories; and  3. To examine the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and changes in sales and purchases of healthier items in the six product categories. We hypothesize that sales of targeted products will be significantly higher, and that more health- focused food marketing environments will be associated with higher sales of healthy food items.  The study will be conducted in 32 supermarkets in urban, low-income, high-minority neighbor- hoods in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Intervention strategies will include prime placement, increased visibility of healthier products, call-out signs, and taste-testing for milk. Control stores will be assessment-only. Supermarket chains will help implement the strategies and provide data on sales of targeted products. Interventions will be conducted for 2 years, with an emphasis on scalability and long-term sustainability. The primary outcome measures of purchasing will be weekly sales per store for each product. Individual purchasing will be assessed in a cohort of shoppers by interviews and shopping receipts. The Grocery Marketing Environment Assessment (GMEA) tool will be used to assess marketing environments.  The research team completed a randomized pilot study of a 6-month intervention in eight supermarkets, which demonstrated the impact of the interventions on three food categories. The proposed study will provide an expanded and extended, larger-scale, rigorous test of novel and widely applicable strategies to encourage healthy retail sales, complement increased- access initiatives, and reduce health disparities in obesity and related diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using a cluster randomized controlled design, this study will evaluate effects of in-store healthy food marketing strategies on sales and purchase of specific healthier items in six product categories (milk, frozen entrees, beverage checkout coolers, salty snacks, bread and cheese); and examine the effects of changes in in-store food marketing environments on sales of healthier foods.

"El Valor de Nuestra Salud (The Value of Our Health) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary intake is an important determinant of risk for obesity and cancer. Consumption of fruits and vegetables reduces risk, yet among Latinos, there is now clear evidence that fruit and vegetable consumption decreases with greater acculturation to the U.S. Interventions targeted at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels of the Socio-Ecological Framework have resulted in changes to dietary intake. However, these studies have neglected to consider that unless changes occur at higher levels of influence (e.g., in stores, in restaurants), individual behavior changes are unlikely to be reinforced and sustained. We propose to refine a pilot-tested intervention to change the food environment of grocery stores to promote consumption of fruits and vegetables. El Valor de Nuestra Salud [The Value of Our Health] will identify, recruit, and match 18 grocery stores (specifically small-to-medium sized Latino grocery stores or tiendas) and randomize them into one of two conditions: intervention versus a no-treatment control condition. The intervention will consist of two communication change strategies and two structural change strategies with the goal of changing aspects of the social and physical environments. The intervention will include employee and manager trainings to promote sales of fruits and vegetables and how to conduct a food marketing campaign. In addition, we will provide equipment and other material resources to the tiendas to promote sales of ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables, and to work with them to modify selections available in the meat and ready-to-eat food departments. Efficacy will be evaluated at the store customer level in terms of baseline to immediate post-intervention (6 months post-baseline) changes in self-reported fruit and vegetable intake in a sample of 360 adult store customers, and maintenance of these changes at the 6-month follow-up (12 months post-baseline). Levels of serum carotenoids collected in a 25% subsample of customers will provide evidence for the validity of dietary self- report. Intervention effectiveness will be evaluated at the employee, manager, and store levels using both self-reported and observed methodological approaches. The RE-AIM framework will be used to assess the potential for disseminating the intervention if it results in improvements in customers' dietary intake. This study is responsive to NCI's call for proposals on Diet and Communication, and given the involvement of a Mexican/Mexican-American population, is responsive to NCI's mission to reduce racial/ethnic health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Risk for obesity and certain cancers are higher among U.S. Latinos as compared with non-Latinos.

"Neural Correlates of Food Reward in American Indian Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 award will allow Dr. Beckman, the first American Indian (AI) adult endocrinologist in the nation, to become an investigator proficient in interdisciplinary research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the causes of obesity. She has a career interest in the neuropsychology of obesity and diabetes and her focus is on the AI population in Minnesota. Obesity is a major health disparity in AIs, yet litle work is being done to unravel the neurobiology of this problem. The training and research activities will allow her to examine the complexities of computational neuroscience, functional neuroanatomy, and the contribution of opioidergic neurons to brain reward pathways. The application proposes an intensive, 5-year program of mentored research and formal training activities to enhance Dr. Beckman's skills and experience in: 1) clinical research methods and biostatistics, 2) technical aspects of fMRI data acquisition and analysis, and 3) role of opioidergic neurons in the neuroendocrine regulation of appetite. In the long term, Dr. Beckman will apply these translational research skills to study neuromodulation, cognitive restructuring, and opioid antagonists as potentially effective treatments for the public health problem of obesity in her AI patients who may be hyperresponsive to environmentally rewarding food cues.  The research component of this career development award targets the neurobiology of behavioral responses to food in 60 AIs. The specific aims are to: 1) use fMRI to compare brain activation associated with the response to visual food cues in obese versus lean AI women, 2) use fMRI to compare the effects of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, versus placebo, on brain activation associated with response to palatable food cues, 3) compare the effects of naltrexone versus placebo on food intake in obese and lean AI women, by measuring calories consumed.  The University of Minnesota is an exceptional environment for Dr. Beckman to gain the skills needed to achieve her goals. The training component uses academic resources including the Division of Diabetes, Metabolism, and Endocrinology, Minnesota Obesity Center, Center for the Study of Impulsivity in Addiction, Center for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Clinical and Translational Science Institute. Dr. Beckman's mentors are highly regarded scientists in the areas of obesity, addiction, and neuroimaging.          Despite the disproportionate obesity burden among AIs, this will be the first study using fMRI and an opioid antagonist to focus on this underrepresented population. Our results will provide important data about brain activation in response to high-calorie foods that will inform dietary interventions aimed at preventing and treating obesity and may identify a promising pharmacologic treatment for obesity and overeating in AIs.

"The Intra-household Distribution of Food and Health Resources amongst Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Policies targeting health improvements for particular household members can, as a result of resource allocation adjustments, have repercussions for all household members. Understanding how these spillovers work within the household could enable the design of smarter health policies which take into account households' optimal readjustments. But we cannot fully measure these reallocation responses without data on dietary intake, which is arguably the most important health resource, especially for children in low-income settings. I propose to 1) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to collect such data, and 2) use it to analyze the effects of nutrition interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources.  To accomplish the first goal, I will engage in three training activities which will enable me to learn about key concepts in nutritional science and measurement issues in dietary intake assessment in low-income settings: 1) coursework, 2) mentoring meetings, and 3) dissemination of my work. To accomplish the second, I will engage in a research program related to understanding the intra-household spillovers of targeted nutrition interventions, focusing on iodine supplementation.  Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) has significant and irreversible effects on cognitive development.  One third of the global population has IDD. Low in utero exposure to iodine leads to reduced intelligence quotients, and in severe cases can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery and growth, hearing and speech problems. Iodine supplementation and fortification programs-both in utero and in early childhood-have been proven to increase child health and cognitive ability, and are thus often used as policy tools in affected areas. Supplementation programs are usually targeted towards pregnant women and young children. However, little is known about how these interventions affect other children in the household who are not targeted.  My research program has 3 specific aims: 1) collect novel data which combine socioeconomic and demographic information with dietary intake measurements for every child in the household; 2) document the patterns of intra-household allocation of food and other health resources; and 3) study the effects of fetal and early childhood iodine supplementation interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources amongst children.  I will accomplish the first aim by designing a dietary intake assessment module and integrating it into a large-scale household panel survey in Ghana. I will accomplish Aim 2 by performing preliminary analyses with these new data. I will accomplish the last aim through two studies. In the first, I will study the effects of a large feta iodine supplementation program in Tanzania using an existing, nationally representative dataset. In this study, I will apply econometric techniques developed for intra-household analyses to examine whether children exposed to more iodine while in utero receive more health resources than their untreated siblings during childhood. In the second study, I will implement and analyze data from a pilot field experiment that will distribute iodine supplements to children under 5 in Ghana. The experiment will run concurrently with the panel survey data collection, allowing me to measure the resulting changes in dietary intake and other health resource allocations.  Without quantifying the household responses to childhood nutrition interventions, particularly in the context of iodine supplementation policies, it is impossible to know the full impact of these programs. Answering this question-are we helping or hurting other children in the household through targeted interventions?-is essential to the design and improved cost-benefit analysis of childhood nutrition programs around the world.         It is impossible to gauge the full impacts of childhood nutrition interventions without measuring how households redistribute resources among children in response. Answering this question-are we helping or hurting other children in the household through targeted interventions?-is essential to the design and improved cost-benefit analysis of childhood nutrition programs around the world.",The Intra-household Distribution of Food and Health Resources amongst Children,8803434,K01HD071949,"['Miscarriage ', ' Spontaneous abortion ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' Cost Benefit Analyses ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Food ', ' Gold Coast ', ' Ghana ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Household ', ' I- element ', ' Iodine ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Parents ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Speech ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Tanzania ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' Vitamin A ', ' Work ', ' World Bank ', ' Measures ', ' Living Standards ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' food resource ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Nutritionist ', ' African ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' iodine deficiency ', ' iodine deficiency syndrome ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Intelligence quotient ', ' fetal ', ' meetings ', ' Stillbirth ', ' early childhood ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Supplementation ', ' Cognitive ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' Perinatal Exposure ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' Behavioral ', ' in utero ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' economic outcome ', ' fortification ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2014,130435,0.10936713770983068
"SES and race-ethnic disparities in food purchasing and dietary intake:2000-2015     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SES and race-ethnic disparities of food purchasing and dietary intake: 2000-2015 Our primary goals are to use in-depth descriptive and longitudinal analyses of shift in food purchases among critical race/ethnic and SES subpopulations to examine the impact of the Great Recession (beginning in 2007), and other SES factors on short-term and long-term food purchase and dietary outcomes. In addition, we will seek to understand factors determining how our key subpopulations select the consumer packaged goods sector (CPGs) foods and beverages they purchase and how this affects their nutrient intake. Food purchase and dietary outcomes include nutritional quality (calories, sodium, saturated fat and added sugars), and patterns (focusing on selected subgroups of foods considered to contain large proportions of empty calories, and away-from-home intakes). Using data purchased under separate funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), the UNC Food Research Program (UNCFRP) has created a longitudinal file of Nielsen Homescan household purchase data from 2000-2012, and we propose to expand this work to later years and additional analyses under this grant. We examine a number of key issues related to the diets of key minority (Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites) and lower income subpopulations. We will use longitudinal commercial data on CPG food and beverage purchases by a nationally representative sample of 35,000 to 60,000 households in each quarter linked with nutrition facts panel data at the barcode level. With a unique crosswalk, we link these commercial data to the publicly available What We Eat in America (WWEIA) dietary intake interview component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) and the US Department of Agriculture nutrient databases. We will implement established linear programming methods to estimate added sugar content of all commercial CPG products (706,451 items in 2000-10 alone). We use longitudinal methods, correct for endogeneity in selection of various types of stores (convenience, grocery, mass merchandisers/supercenters, and warehouse/club stores), account for dynamics in market shares of branded vs. private label products, and examine other issues relevant to dynamics of food purchase and diet among race-ethnic, age and income subpopulations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to evaluate how an array of economic changes, including the Great Recession, may have differentially affected the nutrient composition of consumer package foods and beverages purchases from various categories of food stores, branded vs. private label brands by critical subpopulations. In addition, we will link these changes to individual dietary intake changes in national dietary intake to understand what these changes mean for trends and patterns in access to and intake of key foods and nutrients.

"Race, Socioeconomic Status, Diet and Chronic Kidney Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are most profound among persons of low socioeconomic status (SES), and dietary factors (limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy dietary patterns) likely underlie much of this disparit. Low SES African Americans (AAs) are more likely to experience food insecurity (the inability to afford nutritionally adequate and safe foods) and live in ""food deserts"" (areas where low-income residents do not have access to healthy food and fast food restaurants predominate) which likely contributes to racial differences in dietary patterns. Little is known regarding the potentil effectiveness of dietary interventions among low SES AAs at high risk for CKD incidence or progression. Studies quantifying the association between poor diet and disparities in CKD incidence and progression among low SES AAs and identifying effective strategies to improve dietary habits in this population are critically needed, and could lead to reduced racial disparitis in CKD. The overall objectives of this proposal are to 1) determine the contribution of racial differences in dietary patterns to racial disparities in progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) among low SES individuals in a national population-based study; 2) examine the impact of availability of healthy foods on the effectiveness of a patient, family and community level intervention among low SES AAs with uncontrolled hypertension by using established measures and developing a novel measure of healthy food availability within AAs' homes; 3) identify perceived barriers to healthy dietary patterns and identify potential interventional strategies deemed acceptable among low SES AAs at very high risk for CKD using qualitative methodology; and 4) develop and pilot-test a tailored dietary intervention for low SES AAs at very high risk for CKD by employing the principles of community-based participatory research. The candidate for this K23 Mentored Career Development Award, Dr. Deidra Crews, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Nephrology at Johns Hopkins University and an Associate Faculty Member at the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research. Her long term goal is to improve health outcomes among vulnerable populations through her work as a clinical investigator. The overarching goal of this application is to establish her successful and independent career studying mechanisms to narrow racial disparities in CKD. Under the guidance of exceptional mentors and advisors, Dr. Crews will extend her prior training and work in clinical epidemiology and health disparities research through further didactic training in nutrition, clinical trials and community-based participatory research, and through the performance of novel, complementary studies. She will conduct this work in the rich training environment of the Welch Center, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the Hopkins Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Health Disparities. Dr. Crews' proposed work will not only assure her successful transition to an R01-funded independent investigator, but will also contribute substantially to what is known about racial and socioeconomic disparities in CKD.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are disproportionately affected by chronic kidney disease in the United States, and this disparity is particularly apparent among socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans. Limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy dietary patterns likely contribute to this disparity, and represent modifiable targets fo the prevention of chronic kidney disease in this population.        ","Race, Socioeconomic Status, Diet and Chronic Kidney Disease",8636472,K23DK097184,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Center for Health Statistics ', ' National Center for Health Statistics ', ' NCHS ', ' National Center for Health Statistics (U.S.) ', ' Nephrology ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Diet Habits ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' Funding ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' member ', ' Study Subject ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' hypertension control ', ' Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet ', ' DASH diet ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,171427,0.04814115658787164
"Temporal Trends in Food Sensitization in U.S. Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food allergy appears to have risen rapidly in prevalence over the past few decades, leading to much research into the causes of this apparent 'epidemic'. Yet, because the data showing increased prevalence are largely based on questionnaires, and we know that questionnaires overestimate clinically confirmed food allergy, we truly do not know how real the apparent epidemic is. It is possible that the increased prevalence seen in the questionnaires represents changes in the diagnosis of food allergy, and that biologic markers of this disease remain unchanged. An additional unknown is whether the growing ethnic/racial disparities in food allergy prevalence seen in the self-reported data relate to true biologic differences. In order to determine whether the trends that are found in self reported food allergy correlate with changes in biologic measures of food allergy, we propose to measure food specific IgE in stored samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III, collected from 1988-1994, in order to compare it to that already measured in NHANES 2005-6. Aim 1 is to compare the prevalence of sensitization and higher likelihood of clinical food allergy, both as measured by specific IgE to milk, egg, peanut or shrimp, in U.S. children over this approximately 15 year period. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that Non-Hispanic Blacks have experienced greater increases in prevalence of sensitization and higher specific IgE over this period. Combined, these aims will answer fundamental questions in the field of food allergy epidemiology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is to measure food specific IgE in the surplus sera from a nationally representative survey from obtained from 1988-1994, in order to compare it to specific IgE from a later survey.

"Impact of a Public-Private Mobile Market to Improve Fruit & Vegetable Access     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lower-income and minority groups face significant health disparities with respect to obesity, cancer, heart disease and other chronic conditions. Poor diets, low in fruits and vegetables (F&V) and high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar, contribute to many of the health problems faced by vulnerable groups. While poverty, low- educational attainment and personal food preference are all associated with reduced F&V consumption, these individual-level factors must be viewed in an environmental context. Research has repeatedly demonstrated the important role that environment plays on health decisions and behaviors. Compared with higher-income neighborhoods, lower-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to have a supermarket that sells a variety of F&V and other healthy foods. This is perpetuated by an underlying misconception that there is limited demand or potential profit for new healthy food ventures in these communities. In the few cases where new food outlets have opened in underserved areas, they have been met with substantial customer support. The NC Green Cart program hopes to demonstrate that selling affordable, accessible F&V in lower-income communities is not only financially viable, but can impact behavioral risk factors of individuals in target communities. The NC Green Cart program will build on burgeoning support for a local sustainable food system in NC and leverage a public-private partnership to increase access to fresh F&V in underserved communities. Using a weekly mobile market model, the program will deliver low-cost boxes of fresh F&V to easily accessible community locations (such as churches and day care centers) and provide nutrition and cooking education. Working together with the Green Cart team, this project will 1.) measure the impact of a mobile market at 6, 12 and 18 months on the primary outcome of F&V consumption as well as perceived access to F&V and self- efficacy to purchase, prepare, serve and eat fresh F&V using a randomized controlled design; 2.) assess community support, feasibility, and financial sustainability of the public-private Green Cart partnership; and 3.) explore policy-related barriers and facilitators to the public-private Green Cart operation that could influence future growth and dissemination of the model. Results of this research will inform our understanding of how the food environment impacts dietary choices and provide evidence for researchers, businesses, non-profits and policy makers on the potential impact and viability of using similar models to reduce food access disparities and improve diet.          We will measure the impact and sustainability of a public-private mobile market program to increase access to and demand for fresh F&V in underserved communities where F&V consumption is low and obesity and disease rates are high. This research will help elucidate the role the food environment plays in dietary choices of vulnerable groups and may provide evidence of a viable model for improving diet and health by growing local food systems and stimulating business in underserved communities.

"Technology-Based Measurement of Home Food Availability in Low-Income  Households     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): National data reveals that obesity impacts even young children (2-5 years) and rates steadily increase with age. Obesity prevention efforts that focus on younger children might help to curb the higher rates of overweight/obesity apparent in older children and adolescents. At particular risk for childhood obesity are low-income individuals, who are disproportionately represented in some racial/ethnic minorities. Therefore, understanding modifiable factors, particularly contextual factors linked with obesity-promoting behaviors such as poor dietary intake, may help to identify appropriate targets of obesity prevention. The home food environment plays a pivotal role in the diets of children, particularly younger children, who still consume most of their meals at home. Yet, little is known about the diet quality of the home food environment. Previous studies have looked at selected food groups or nutrients within the home food environment using self-reported checklists; however, this approach may miss foods regularly available in homes of less understood groups (e.g. racially/ethnically diverse groups, families with young children). Therefore, the goal of this pilo study is to build upon the research that examines home food availability by testing an objective approach for measuring home food availability in the households of low-income African American and Hispanic families with young children. Specifically, the proposed study sets out to conduct comprehensive home inventories using Universal Product Scanners (UPC) in the households of African American and Hispanic families with young children (2-5 years) residing in low-income communities. The aims of this study are: 1) to examine the feasibility of this approach on 90 minority households with young children, 2) To validate an existing home food availability checklist (self-reported) against completed home food inventories (direct observation via UPC scanner), and 3) To evaluate the diet quality of the home food supply and to: a) examine its relationship with dietary intake, specifically calories, total and saturated fats, and added sugars, b) determine if there are any differences in diet quality of the home food supply by race/ethnicity or by weight status, respectively. The findings of this proposed study will identify modifiable targets within the home environment for future obesity prevention interventions focusing on this population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying contextual factors that may influence the development of obesity in children has been the focus of recent research. For young children, the home is the context where most meals are consumed and eating habits begin to develop. Yet, little is known about the overall diet quality of the home food environment, particularly among low-income minority families with young children who are at greater risk for obesity. Current methods limit our ability to evaluate the overall diet quality of these environments; therefore, the proposed project will attempt to address this gap and will help identify appropriate diet-related targets of obesity prevention within the home food environment.            ",Technology-Based Measurement of Home Food Availability in Low-Income  Households,8693393,R21HD080157,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Body Weight ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food ', ' Food Supply ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Illinois ', ' Infant ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' preschool ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Diet Habits ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Comprehension ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' programs ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' saturated fat ', ' early childhood ', ' Nutrient ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' obesity prevention ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 year old ', ' obesity risk ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2014,238477,0.21854043033942291
"Influence of Food Insecurity on Adherence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research proposal requests 3 years of support to conduct developmental intervention studies to design and field test a theory-based intervention to address food insecurity and improve antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among men and women living with HIV infection. Food insecurity is prevalent among people living with HIV in US inner-cities, with as many as 43% not having sufficient food and experiencing intermittent hunger. Food insecurity has demonstrated direct associations with ART adherence including predicting non-adherence over and above other factors including depression, social support, and alcohol use. Food insecurity is particularly problematic in relation to substance abuse given competing survival needs and the dire combined health consequences of alcoholism, addiction and malnutrition. Guided by the Conservation of Resources Theory of Stress and Coping, we will conduct 3 stages of intervention development research: (1) initial interviews and focus groups with people living with HIV who take ART, use substances, and experience food insecurity. Based on information gained from rapid formative studies, this first stage of research will be used to develop a theory-based intervention to address accessing food and sustaining ART adherence; (2) Test the feasibility of the newly developed food insecurity and adherence intervention with a small sample of HIV positive men and women who are taking ART, use substances, and experience food insecurity. Stage 2 will also finalize and pilot test all assessment instruments and protocols for data collection; and (3) Conduct a randomized field test to determine the potential efficacy of the food insecurity and ART adherence intervention. Participants in the field test will be randomly assigned to either receive the newly developed intervention or a time matched attention comparison condition. Following a 6- month follow-up period, we will test for differences between groups on ART adherence, food access, nutrition, and coping resource outcomes. The intervention development will include pilot testing daily food, mood, and substance use behaviors monitored by interactive text-message surveys. We will also examine the intervention effects on mediating theoretical constructs derived by Conservation of Resources Theory. Our developmental research will also examine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting the intervention in face-to-face intervention sessions. The proposed intervention research will therefore develop new strategies for use with people living with HIV who are taking ART under adverse conditions with multiple competing needs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lack of access to food and the intermittent experience of hunger are prevalent among people living with HIV in the United States. Effective strategies are urgently needed to assist people living with HIV to access food and sustain long- term medication adherence under the most challenging conditions. This proposal requests support to conduct developmental research to design and field test a theory-based intervention to directly address food insecurity, hunger and poor nutrition as barriers to medication adherence among men and women living with HIV infection in US urban areas.

"Environmental Changes and Health Outcomes across 25 Years: Four US Cities  ABSTRACT While observational research suggests an association between obesity-related social environment factors with obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors, very little research has addressed the specific factors and pathways linking the social environment to cardiometabolic risk. The primary reasons for this lack of research are: 1) lack of high quality data on diet, activity, measured height and weight over time linked to cardiometabolic risk biomarkers; 2) lack of fine-grain longitudinal data on the introduction, renovation, and closure of food- and activity-related environmental features; and 3) lack of complex statistical models examining each piece of the time-dependent, complex system, accounting for the process by which food, activity, and transportation facilities are established and expanded and the potential for individuals to selectively migrate to locate near such facilities. The 25-year, longitudinal Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study provides a wide age range, high quality longitudinal, biological, behavioral and anthropometry and biomarker data of CARDIA, geographic diversity, and different patterns and pace of change across the four baseline cities: Birmingham, Chicago, Minneapolis and Oakland. The research team has developed a unique method to use retrospective and contemporary sources to create data on the timing and placement of introductions, renovations, and closures of: 1) food resources (e.g., restaurants, food shopping); 2) recreation facilities (e.g., trails, parks); and 3) transportation infrastructure (e.g., light rail, bike parking, bike paths) in Birmingham, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Oakland over a 25-year period. Furthermore, we have developed sophisticated statistical models that account for purposeful (as opposed to random) placement of relevant resources in the social environment as well as individuals' ability to selectively migrate to locate near such resources. Study objectives include: 1) Develop and validate new fine-grain measures to capture introductions, renovations, and closures representing changes in: a) parks, trails, and other recreational sites; b) food environments; and c) transportation infrastructure that will be contemporaneously linked to CARDIA respondents' geographic locations over 25 years; and 2) Using this unique data source, estimate the effects of introductions, renovations, and closures of key food and activity facilities and transportation infrastructure on diet and activity behaviors, body weight and cardiometabolic risk in the four field cities over 25 years, while accounting for the endogenous placement of food and activity facilities and selective migration. We will specifically focus on comparisons across individual-level race, income, and education groups to examine how environmental factors contribute to race and SES inequalities in diet, obesity, and cardiometabolic risk from young- to mid-adulthood. The proposed research will improve current understanding of the mechanisms through which social environments (specifically broader societal, economic, and environmental contexts) influence health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The US is experiencing substantial burden in obesity and cardiometabolic disease, yet very little research has addressed the specific factors and pathways linking the social environment to cardiometabolic risk. The objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of mechanisms through which social environments influence obesity and cardiometabolic risk, determine which factors in the social environment are particularly influential, and to advance analytic methods to understand these complex pathways. Ultimately the proposed research will inform macro-level social environment policies to mitigate early development of disease risk in the early to middle adult years.",Environmental Changes and Health Outcomes across 25 Years: Four US Cities,8722014,R01HL114091,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Body Weight ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Food ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Influentials ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' food resource ', ' improved ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Attenuated ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Height ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' experience ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Dietary intake ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' P30 Grant ', ' P30 Award ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements (P30) ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' food consumption ', ' weight maintenance ', ' environmental change ', ' Outcome ', ' migration ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2014,444221,0.15725144388468565
"Obesity and Metabolic Risk Disparities: Underlying Food Environment Factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While a major focus of disparities research has been on understanding patterns of health determinants and outcomes by race-ethnic and SES subpopulations, there are major gaps in understanding how to use public policy to reduce these gaps. The proposed project examines food prices and food environment factors, two areas with great potential for policy change. We will use longitudinal data to understand the effects of changes in food prices, and availability and access to away-from-home food eateries and food shopping options on diet, and in turn, weight gain and metabolic risk factors. We will finalize a longitudinal data set that geographically and temporally links food price and food environment measures to residential locations of respondents of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a study of the antecedents and risk factors for cardiovascular disease in an ethnicity-, age-, and sex-balanced cohort of 5,115 black and white young adults aged 18-30 years at baseline (1985-86) and followed over 25 years into 2010-11. We capitalize upon neighborhood-level data linked to individual data using a multidisciplinary approach melding spatial analysis methodologies with traditional epidemiological and economic methods. We examine how food prices and neighborhood food and social environmental factors interact with individual-level household income and education to affect the adoption and maintenance of overall measures of beverage and diet quality. Furthermore, we will examine the effect of these behaviors on change in weight and metabolic risk factors (e.g., fasting glucose, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL and HDL cholesterol) over 25 years. We specifically examine how these relationships differ by individual-level race/ethnicity, income, and education. The proposed study builds on work we have done to create a CARDIA neighborhood-level dataset consisting of price and economic data for Exam Years 1-20 and a food environment dataset for years 1-15 (we currently do not have food environment data for year 20). Specific aims include: 1) Add identical food environment data for Year 20 (2005-06) when we will have the third wave of individual-level dietary data; 2) Create and implement a full structural equations model with a specific focus on comparisons within race-ethnicity (black versus white), income (high versus low), education (high versus low) to jointly examine the temporal impact of economic and food environment factors on: (a) individual-level beverage intake and overall diet quality, (b) patterns of weight maintenance and gain, and (c) the incidence, persistence, and reversal on the above metabolic risk factors (controlling for residential choice, pregnancy and marriage status, physical activity and smoking). Using this full system we will be able to examine the full set of relationships between food prices and food environment factors with diet, weight and metabolic risk factors. Our overall impact is to identify economic and food environment factors that are associated with health and can be addressed as potential targets for intervention to reduce disparities in obesity and metabolic risk.        We will use longitudinal data to examine the full set of relationships between food prices and food environment factors with diet, weight and metabolic risk factors.

"American Indian Diabetes Prevention Center:  Impacting Health Disparity in Youth PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions); This project collaboratively forges an alternative future for American Indian people relative to diabetes.  Several disciplines are joined from within the clinical health, social, behavioral, and cultural sciences as well as native advisors to comprise the intellectual engine of this proposed center. Knitting these diverse professional cultures into an effective interdisciplinary force will be done by iterative psychoeducational seminars. The Specific Aims are to reduce health disparities among American Indian (Al) people by 1) conducting medical and sociocultural research strengthening diabetes prevention and management in the context of contemporary Al culture, 2) developing interdisciplinary values and skills pervading all operations, 3) developing curricula fostering new skills and manpower in health disparities research, 4) collaborating with Al communities to produce diabetes education in culturally appropriate ways using new, easily accessed media, and 5) administering Center operations by Al's with Al perspectives that honor all people and things. The Administrative Core is composed of the PI, Project Coordinator, Administrative Director, and two staff assistants. This Core will manage all Center functions. The Research Core has three Research Sub- Projects: 1) discovering cultural categories of parental distress due to diabetes care of children with Type 1and 2 diabetes for use in behavioral medicine counseling, 2) testing efficacy of financial incentives for increasing physical activity in obese youth and change in cardiometabolic status, and 3) comparing the differential risk for preeclampsia among Caucasian, American Indian, and Hispanic women to explore hypothesized protective effects in indigenous people of the Western hemisphere. The Research Training/Education Core will 1) develop a new certificate program in nursing on health disparity reduction research, practice, and ethics, 2) develop the capacity to produce a series of 12-minute video stories (a highly valued approach to teaching among Al's) for dissemination and evaluation, and 3) conduct education on diabetes to Al adults with integrated encouragement to serve as health disparities research subjects. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core will 1) conduct a Youth Asset building program using community, family, and individual factors that assist youth in avoiding risky health behaviors, 2) evaluate the CDC Eagle Books in public schools with high Al enrollment, and 3) add a new community partner comprised of owners of rural, small food stores to begin promoting healthy foods, and 4) continue the Oklahoma City Area Intertribal Health Board partnership of all tribes in Oklahoma. Texas, and Kansas.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project will improve the public's health by reducing the unacceptably huge diabetes health disparity crisis among Al people through finding better means to: provide clinical care in its treatment, prevent onset, reduce familial distress in chronic disease coping, develop better healthy decision-making among youth, and develop better means to  communicate healthy lifestyle choices. The project also creates a collaboration with rural, small food outlets as ""Good Food Neighbors"" to promote selling healthier foods and introduces ""digital storytelling"" appropriate to Indian

"Snacking in young children: parental definitions, goals, and feeding practices     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Snacking is suspected to contribute to excessive energy intake among young children.  The family is a fundamental context for understanding how children's snacking habits develop.  Yet, no studies have examined parenting effects on children's snacking behaviors for low-income ethnic minority families who are at particular risk of food insecurity, poor diet quality, and obesity.  Research on snacking has been hindered by the lack of an accepted, empirically-based definition of snacking.  Focusing on low-income African American  and Hispanic families with preschool-aged children, this study will: qualitatively describe parents' definitions of  child snacking and their approaches to feeding children snacks (Aim 1)~ rigorously develop and test a  quantitative measure of these constructs (Aim 2)~ and evaluate relationships between parenting specific to  child snacking and (a) parents' general child feeding practices and styles (b) children's nutrition and weight- related outcomes (Aim 3). This study will advance basic and translational science on parenting and child snacking through real-world empirical characterization of snacking from parents' perspective and development of the first validated measure of parents' snacking-specific feeding practices. Our interdisciplinary research team includes experts in children's nutrition and child feeding, theories of parenting and food schemas, and qualitative and quantitative methods.  Innovations of the proposed research include the first empirical description of parents' definitions of child snacking and thei associated feeding approaches, the integration of research on food schemas and child-feeding, and the focus on snacking in low-income ethnic-minority children who are at disproportionate risk of poor nutrition and obesity.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is the first comprehensive investigation of low-income ethnic minority parents' definitions, goals, and feeding practices specific to children's snacking.  This research has significant public health implications given th fundamental role of excessive energy consumption in the obesity epidemic, the increased frequency of snacking among US children and the lack of understanding of its determinants.              ","Snacking in young children: parental definitions, goals, and feeding practices",8676852,R21HD074554,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Behavior ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' pediatric nutrition ', ' Child Nutrition ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' preschool ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' Solid ', ' sugar ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Measurement ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' energy balance ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' parent influence ', ' parental influence ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' obesity prevention ', ' feeding ', ' Outcome ', ' Guide prevention ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' aged ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R21,2014,188538,0.10216683334114199
"Appalachians Together Restoring the Eating Environment (APPAL-TREE)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): identified as a key priority population by the NIMHD, the Appalachian counties of Kentucky suffer from some of the nation's highest rates of obesity and overweight, lowest rates of produce consumption, and high rates of premature mortality and diet-related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and various cancers. With the main partnership of three community-based organizations - the Community Farm Alliance (a community development organization designed to improve food production systems). Faith Moves Mountains (a community-based research team with ten years of culturally-based intervention experience), and the Big Sandy Area Development District (a well-respected network that plans, promotes, and coordinates programs for regional economic, health, and social development of Appalachia) - and with extensive input from the Community Advisory Board (CAB), faith partners, and Cooperative Extension, this community-academic partnership proposes to address the most modifiable risk factor for these main causes of morbidity and mortality: suboptimal diet. In this three-year planning grant, the community-academic collaboration will undertake three specific aims and associated activities. In Aim 1, the project team will conduct a community needs assessment and assets inventory, hold community forums to present this information, and meet regularly with the community partners and CAB. The nutrition and agricultural economic co-investigators will partner with the community research team to use innovative and established methods, including GIS mapping, focus groups, and nutritional and economic assessment techniques. In Aim 2, community forums, CAB meetings, and collaborative engagement sessions among project partners will facilitate the selection and initiation of an evidence-based pilot intervention to promote better nutrition, emphasizing food access, particularly fruits and vegetables. In Aim 3, the community-academic collaborative will implement and evaluate this pilot intervention, tracking nutritional outcomes, participant satisfaction, and costs and reporting results to Appalachian community members.         RELEVANCE: By addressing one of the nation's leading public health challenges - poor diet leading to overweight/obesity and subsequent health impacts - in a region (Appalachian Kentucky) suffering extreme disparities in diet and diet-related disease, this project will develop implement, and evaluate a comprehensive approach to dietary change by increasing access to healthy foods.              ",Appalachians Together Restoring the Eating Environment (APPAL-TREE),8610946,R24MD008018,"['agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Americas ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Kentucky ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Development ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' farmer ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' satisfaction ', ' Collaborations ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' meetings ', ' Farm ', ' Farming environment ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' risk perception ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Food Safety ', ' Advocate ', ' Improve Access ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' evidence base ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R24,2014,340119,0.15746832618599507
"El Valor de Nuestra Salud (The Value of Our Health)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary intake is an important determinant of risk for obesity and cancer. Consumption of fruits and vegetables reduces risk, yet among Latinos, there is now clear evidence that fruit and vegetable consumption decreases with greater acculturation to the U.S. Interventions targeted at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels of the Socio-Ecological Framework have resulted in changes to dietary intake. However, these studies have neglected to consider that unless changes occur at higher levels of influence (e.g., in stores, in restaurants), individual behavior changes are unlikely to be reinforced and sustained. We propose to refine a pilot-tested intervention to change the food environment of grocery stores to promote consumption of fruits and vegetables. El Valor de Nuestra Salud [The Value of Our Health] will identify, recruit, and match 18 grocery stores (specifically small-to-medium sized Latino grocery stores or tiendas) and randomize them into one of two conditions: intervention versus a no-treatment control condition. The intervention will consist of two communication change strategies and two structural change strategies with the goal of changing aspects of the social and physical environments. The intervention will include employee and manager trainings to promote sales of fruits and vegetables and how to conduct a food marketing campaign. In addition, we will provide equipment and other material resources to the tiendas to promote sales of ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables, and to work with them to modify selections available in the meat and ready-to-eat food departments. Efficacy will be evaluated at the store customer level in terms of baseline to immediate post-intervention (6 months post-baseline) changes in self-reported fruit and vegetable intake in a sample of 360 adult store customers, and maintenance of these changes at the 6-month follow-up (12 months post-baseline). Levels of serum carotenoids collected in a 25% subsample of customers will provide evidence for the validity of dietary self- report. Intervention effectiveness will be evaluated at the employee, manager, and store levels using both self-reported and observed methodological approaches. The RE-AIM framework will be used to assess the potential for disseminating the intervention if it results in improvements in customers' dietary intake. This study is responsive to NCI's call for proposals on Diet and Communication, and given the involvement of a Mexican/Mexican-American population, is responsive to NCI's mission to reduce racial/ethnic health disparities.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Risk for obesity and certain cancers are higher among U.S. Latinos as compared with non-Latinos. Risk factors for obesity and cancer include not eating enough fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods, and this is particularly pronounced among Latinos who have less access to healthy foods. This study adds to the growing body of research on environmental-level interventions by proposing to work with Latino grocery stores to increase the availability of fruits and vegetables and ultimately impact the diets of its customers.

"Evaluating a Food Hub Opening in an Urban Context ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food hubs are an emerging and increasingly popular approach to reduce obesity trends by improving diet through increased access to nutritious foods. Food hubs offer a wide variety of healthy foods for purchase by both consumers and other food retailers (e.g., corner stores), and typically operate on a value-based business model that prioritizes both economic development and community benefit. Food hubs may be particularly impactful in ""food desert"" communities that have limited or no access to traditional food retailers, are low income, and have high rates of obesity. However, there is currently no evidence of the influence of a food hub on dietary behaviors related to preventing and reducing obesity. This study will provide programmatic and policy-relevant evidence to close this gap by taking advantage of a time-sensitive opportunity to evaluate a newly forming food hub that will be established through two independent grants awarded to the community (not the research team) in late 2014. The new food hub will open in October 2015, and this rapid response study will provide a chance to collect baseline data prior to opening. The central hypothesis guiding this research is that the food hub will improve both physical and social access to nutritious foods, which will improve diet quality, fruit and vegetable consumption, and caloric intake among people living near the new food hub. Using a quasi-experimental design with repeated measures, changes in diet will be compared between primary food shoppers living in the intervention community receiving the new food hub to those in a matched control community. Dietary changes will be measured at three time points (baseline and 12 and 24 months post food hub) using the Nutrition Data System for Research, the gold standard for assessing 24-hour dietary recalls to examine individual-level changes. At each time point, three dietary recalls will be collected to provide more accurate estimates. The study will examine changes in the three diet outcomes (e.g., diet quality, FV consumption, caloric intake) between residents in the two communities, will assess the extent that psychosocial factors explain these changes, and, among residents in the intervention community, will examine the dose-response relationship between food hub use and changes in diet using objective measures of food hub shopping. Additionally, this research will contribute to the science of food environment interventions to prevent or reduce obesity by assessing the impact of the new food hub on the broader food retail environment. Finally, the study will contribute to the science and practice of implementing food hub interventions by examining how the specific intervention components (such as healthy food incentives, healthy food community organizers, cooking clubs, etc.) are implemented and received by the community as well as intended and unintended consequences. Findings will provide evidence about the extent to which food hub interventions contribute to changes in diet among people living in low-income, urban communities, and will offer guidance for reducing obesity trends and inequities.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This study will evaluate the effect of a new food hub opening in a low-income, urban community that is currently defined as a food desert. The study will evaluate the impact of the food hub on changes in diet among people living near the food hub. Results will provide critical and timely guidance to inform public health policy and programs to achieve the Healthy People 2020 goal to reduce obesity trends and inequities.        ",Evaluating a Food Hub Opening in an Urban Context,9032677,R01DK108184,"['Adoption ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Economical Development ', ' Economic Development ', ' Environment ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Ohio ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vendor ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' cooking ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' psychosocial ', ' Supermarket ', ' sq. ft ', ' square foot ', ' Prevention Research ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' trend ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' community intervention ', ' consumer demand ', ' systems research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' public health research ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NIDDK,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,694629,0.33854425458696996
"Neural Correlates of Food Reward in American Indian Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 award will allow Dr. Beckman, the first American Indian (AI) adult endocrinologist in the nation, to become an investigator proficient in interdisciplinary research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the causes of obesity. She has a career interest in the neuropsychology of obesity and diabetes and her focus is on the AI population in Minnesota. Obesity is a major health disparity in AIs, yet litle work is being done to unravel the neurobiology of this problem. The training and research activities will allow her to examine the complexities of computational neuroscience, functional neuroanatomy, and the contribution of opioidergic neurons to brain reward pathways. The application proposes an intensive, 5-year program of mentored research and formal training activities to enhance Dr. Beckman's skills and experience in: 1) clinical research methods and biostatistics, 2) technical aspects of fMRI data acquisition and analysis, and 3) role of opioidergic neurons in the neuroendocrine regulation of appetite. In the long term, Dr. Beckman will apply these translational research skills to study neuromodulation, cognitive restructuring, and opioid antagonists as potentially effective treatments for the public health problem of obesity in her AI patients who may be hyperresponsive to environmentally rewarding food cues.  The research component of this career development award targets the neurobiology of behavioral responses to food in 60 AIs. The specific aims are to: 1) use fMRI to compare brain activation associated with the response to visual food cues in obese versus lean AI women, 2) use fMRI to compare the effects of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, versus placebo, on brain activation associated with response to palatable food cues, 3) compare the effects of naltrexone versus placebo on food intake in obese and lean AI women, by measuring calories consumed.  The University of Minnesota is an exceptional environment for Dr. Beckman to gain the skills needed to achieve her goals. The training component uses academic resources including the Division of Diabetes, Metabolism, and Endocrinology, Minnesota Obesity Center, Center for the Study of Impulsivity in Addiction, Center for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Clinical and Translational Science Institute. Dr. Beckman's mentors are highly regarded scientists in the areas of obesity, addiction, and neuroimaging. Despite the disproportionate obesity burden among AIs, this will be the first study using fMRI and an opioid antagonist to focus on this underrepresented population. Our results will provide important data about brain activation in response to high-calorie foods that will inform dietary interventions aimed at preventing and treating obesity and may identify a promising pharmacologic treatment for obesity and overeating in AIs.",Neural Correlates of Food Reward in American Indian Women,8926393,K23DK090131,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+)

"SES and race-ethnic disparities in food purchasing and dietary intake:2000-2015 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SES and race-ethnic disparities of food purchasing and dietary intake: 2000-2015 Our primary goals are to use in-depth descriptive and longitudinal analyses of shift in food purchases among critical race/ethnic and SES subpopulations to examine the impact of the Great Recession (beginning in 2007), and other SES factors on short-term and long-term food purchase and dietary outcomes. In addition, we will seek to understand factors determining how our key subpopulations select the consumer packaged goods sector (CPGs) foods and beverages they purchase and how this affects their nutrient intake. Food purchase and dietary outcomes include nutritional quality (calories, sodium, saturated fat and added sugars), and patterns (focusing on selected subgroups of foods considered to contain large proportions of empty calories, and away-from-home intakes). Using data purchased under separate funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), the UNC Food Research Program (UNCFRP) has created a longitudinal file of Nielsen Homescan household purchase data from 2000-2012, and we propose to expand this work to later years and additional analyses under this grant. We examine a number of key issues related to the diets of key minority (Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites) and lower income subpopulations. We will use longitudinal commercial data on CPG food and beverage purchases by a nationally representative sample of 35,000 to 60,000 households in each quarter linked with nutrition facts panel data at the barcode level. With a unique crosswalk, we link these commercial data to the publicly available What We Eat in America (WWEIA) dietary intake interview component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) and the US Department of Agriculture nutrient databases. We will implement established linear programming methods to estimate added sugar content of all commercial CPG products (706,451 items in 2000-10 alone). We use longitudinal methods, correct for endogeneity in selection of various types of stores (convenience, grocery, mass merchandisers/supercenters, and warehouse/club stores), account for dynamics in market shares of branded vs. private label products, and examine other issues relevant to dynamics of food purchase and diet among race-ethnic, age and income subpopulations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to evaluate how an array of economic changes, including the Great Recession, may have differentially affected the nutrient composition of consumer package foods and beverages purchases from various categories of food stores, branded vs. private label brands by critical subpopulations. In addition, we will link these changes to individual dietary intake changes in national dietary intake to understand what these changes mean for trends and patterns in access to and intake of key foods and nutrients.

"Technology-Based Measurement of Home Food Availability in Low-Income  Households DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): National data reveals that obesity impacts even young children (2-5 years) and rates steadily increase with age. Obesity prevention efforts that focus on younger children might help to curb the higher rates of overweight/obesity apparent in older children and adolescents. At particular risk for childhood obesity are low-income individuals, who are disproportionately represented in some racial/ethnic minorities. Therefore, understanding modifiable factors, particularly contextual factors linked with obesity-promoting behaviors such as poor dietary intake, may help to identify appropriate targets of obesity prevention. The home food environment plays a pivotal role in the diets of children, particularly younger children, who still consume most of their meals at home. Yet, little is known about the diet quality of the home food environment. Previous studies have looked at selected food groups or nutrients within the home food environment using self-reported checklists; however, this approach may miss foods regularly available in homes of less understood groups (e.g. racially/ethnically diverse groups, families with young children). Therefore, the goal of this pilo study is to build upon the research that examines home food availability by testing an objective approach for measuring home food availability in the households of low-income African American and Hispanic families with young children. Specifically, the proposed study sets out to conduct comprehensive home inventories using Universal Product Scanners (UPC) in the households of African American and Hispanic families with young children (2-5 years) residing in low-income communities. The aims of this study are: 1) to examine the feasibility of this approach on 90 minority households with young children, 2) To validate an existing home food availability checklist (self-reported) against completed home food inventories (direct observation via UPC scanner), and 3) To evaluate the diet quality of the home food supply and to: a) examine its relationship with dietary intake, specifically calories, total and saturated fats, and added sugars, b) determine if there are any differences in diet quality of the home food supply by race/ethnicity or by weight status, respectively. The findings of this proposed study will identify modifiable targets within the home environment for future obesity prevention interventions focusing on this population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying contextual factors that may influence the development of obesity in children has been the focus of recent research. For young children, the home is the context where most meals are consumed and eating habits begin to develop. Yet, little is known about the overall diet quality of the home food environment, particularly among low-income minority families with young children who are at greater risk for obesity. Current methods limit our ability to evaluate the overall diet quality of these environments; therefore, the proposed project will attempt to address this gap and will help identify appropriate diet-related targets of obesity prevention within the home food environment.",Technology-Based Measurement of Home Food Availability in Low-Income  Households,8837048,R21HD080157,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Body Weight ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food ', ' Food Supply ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Illinois ', ' Infant ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' preschool ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Diet Habits ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Comprehension ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' programs ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' saturated fat ', ' early childhood ', ' Nutrient ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' obesity prevention ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 year old ', ' obesity risk ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2015,194390,0.21854043033942291
"Cohort filtering models to identify social program effects on health disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Extensive prior research has established that health disparities between race/ethnic and income groups are profoundly influenced by ""social determinants"" of health, such as poverty or access to healthy foods. While the existence of health disparities has been extensively chronicled in the research literature, far less research has evaluated the large-scale social programs-such as income support and food assistance programs-that address the social determinants of health, and are hypothesized to significantly reduce health disparities. The major scientific problem we seek to address is to identify whether, and to what degree, major social programs that affect the social determinants of health actually reduce health disparities. Answering this seemingly-simple question has been problematic due to persistent methodological limitations. Randomized trials of large-scale social programs have been prohibitively expensive, and are rarely conducted due to ethical dilemmas (e.g., randomizing hungry people to receive or not receive food support to identify their long-term type 2 diabetes risk violates obvious principles of beneficence). Ecological analyses conducted on aggregate data have suffered from ecological fallacies, while longitudinal cohort data have suffered from selection biases due to `confounding by indication'. Here, we propose a novel method called ""cohort filtering models"" that can evaluate the impact of large-scale social programs while overcoming the traditional barriers to unbiased evaluation. The method can be applied to a wide range of studies of social programs affecting health, crossing multiple domains of disease prevention programs, and crossing multiple domains of health behaviors and disparities outcomes. The strategy involves a novel nonparametric method to mimic a randomized controlled trial, combining the benefits of matching methods, instrumental variables techniques, and systems science simulations. The method will be applied to two longitudinal datasets we have assembled that allow us to link health and social program data at the individual level over several decades. We have linked health risk factor and health outcome data since 1968 and 1979, respectively, among two nationally-representative cohorts of Americans to administrative data revealing participation in eight major social support programs that reach over 1 in 3 Americans, ranging from income support to food assistance programs. Our preliminary research reveals how our unique approach can answer critical questions such as: how would altering the eligibility criteria for the country's largest nutrition programs be expected to alter disparities in obesity and type 2 diabetes? How much are race/ethnic disparities in preventable asthma exacerbations reduced by newly-expanded affordable housing programs? These are critical questions for health disparities research, which have not been possible to validly answer due to persistent methodological barriers to progress. In addition to testing and optimizing our new method, we will extend our user-friendly web-based data analysis interface using cloud-computing technologies so that any scientist can apply our method to their data or to public datasets, to test the effects of interventions on health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Large-scale social programs-such as income support and food assistance programs-are hypothesized to significantly reduce health disparities. Persistent methodological limitations have prevented us from testing this hypothesis in a scientifically-valid manner. Here, we propose to develop a novel method that provides social science researchers with a high-powered and valid strategy to identify the effects of large-scale social programs on health disparities.                ",Cohort filtering models to identify social program effects on health disparities,8929065,DP2MD010478,"['MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Food ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Social Sciences ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Food Assistance Programs ', ' Outcome ', ' user-friendly ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' social health determinants ', ' randomized trial ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Benevolence ', ' Beneficence ', ' Ecological Fallacy ', ' Ecological Bias ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' ']",NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP2,2015,2370000,0.10674533026259038
"Race, Socioeconomic Status, Diet and Chronic Kidney Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are most profound among persons of low socioeconomic status (SES), and dietary factors (limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy dietary patterns) likely underlie much of this disparit. Low SES African Americans (AAs) are more likely to experience food insecurity (the inability to afford nutritionally adequate and safe foods) and live in ""food deserts"" (areas where low-income residents do not have access to healthy food and fast food restaurants predominate) which likely contributes to racial differences in dietary patterns. Little is known regarding the potentil effectiveness of dietary interventions among low SES AAs at high risk for CKD incidence or progression. Studies quantifying the association between poor diet and disparities in CKD incidence and progression among low SES AAs and identifying effective strategies to improve dietary habits in this population are critically needed, and could lead to reduced racial disparitis in CKD. The overall objectives of this proposal are to 1) determine the contribution of racial differences in dietary patterns to racial disparities in progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) among low SES individuals in a national population-based study; 2) examine the impact of availability of healthy foods on the effectiveness of a patient, family and community level intervention among low SES AAs with uncontrolled hypertension by using established measures and developing a novel measure of healthy food availability within AAs' homes; 3) identify perceived barriers to healthy dietary patterns and identify potential interventional strategies deemed acceptable among low SES AAs at very high risk for CKD using qualitative methodology; and 4) develop and pilot-test a tailored dietary intervention for low SES AAs at very high risk for CKD by employing the principles of community-based participatory research. The candidate for this K23 Mentored Career Development Award, Dr. Deidra Crews, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Nephrology at Johns Hopkins University and an Associate Faculty Member at the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research. Her long term goal is to improve health outcomes among vulnerable populations through her work as a clinical investigator. The overarching goal of this application is to establish her successful and independent career studying mechanisms to narrow racial disparities in CKD. Under the guidance of exceptional mentors and advisors, Dr. Crews will extend her prior training and work in clinical epidemiology and health disparities research through further didactic training in nutrition, clinical trials and community-based participatory research, and through the performance of novel, complementary studies. She will conduct this work in the rich training environment of the Welch Center, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the Hopkins Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Health Disparities. Dr. Crews' proposed work will not only assure her successful transition to an R01-funded independent investigator, but will also contribute substantially to what is known about racial and socioeconomic disparities in CKD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are disproportionately affected by chronic kidney disease in the United States, and this disparity is particularly apparent among socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans. Limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy dietary patterns likely contribute to this disparity, and represent modifiable targets fo the prevention of chronic kidney disease in this population.","Race, Socioeconomic Status, Diet and Chronic Kidney Disease",8843839,K23DK097184,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Center for Health Statistics ', ' National Center for Health Statistics ', ' NCHS ', ' National Center for Health Statistics (U.S.) ', ' Nephrology ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Diet Habits ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' Funding ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' member ', ' Study Subject ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' hypertension control ', ' Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet ', ' DASH diet ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,170592,0.04814115658787164
"The Impact of Healthy Food Marketing Strategies In Supermarkets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the prevalence of obesity has increased, public health experts have increasingly focused on the environments that shape overeating and unhealthy food choices. Retail grocery stores are pivotally positioned to influence choices and favorably affect energy balance. Greater availability of healthier foods, if translated to health-promoting purchases, can positively affect diet quality among those at greatest risk for obesity- low-income, ethnic minorities.  The aims of the proposed study are:  1. To evaluate, in a cluster randomized controlled trial design, effects of in-store healthy food  marketing strategies on sales and purchase of healthier items in six product categories  (milk, frozen entrees, beverage checkout coolers, bread, salty snacks and cheese); and  2. To evaluate the association of changes in supermarket food marketing environments with  changes in sales of specific healthier food items in the same six product categories; and  3. To examine the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and changes in sales and purchases of healthier items in the six product categories. We hypothesize that sales of targeted products will be significantly higher, and that more health- focused food marketing environments will be associated with higher sales of healthy food items.  The study will be conducted in 32 supermarkets in urban, low-income, high-minority neighbor- hoods in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Intervention strategies will include prime placement, increased visibility of healthier products, call-out signs, and taste-testing for milk. Control stores will be assessment-only. Supermarket chains will help implement the strategies and provide data on sales of targeted products. Interventions will be conducted for 2 years, with an emphasis on scalability and long-term sustainability. The primary outcome measures of purchasing will be weekly sales per store for each product. Individual purchasing will be assessed in a cohort of shoppers by interviews and shopping receipts. The Grocery Marketing Environment Assessment (GMEA) tool will be used to assess marketing environments.  The research team completed a randomized pilot study of a 6-month intervention in eight supermarkets, which demonstrated the impact of the interventions on three food categories. The proposed study will provide an expanded and extended, larger-scale, rigorous test of novel and widely applicable strategies to encourage healthy retail sales, complement increased- access initiatives, and reduce health disparities in obesity and related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using a cluster randomized controlled design, this study will evaluate effects of in-store healthy food marketing strategies on sales and purchase of specific healthier items in six product categories (milk, frozen entrees, beverage checkout coolers, salty snacks, bread and cheese); and examine the effects of changes in in-store food marketing environments on sales of healthier foods.

"Appalachians Together Restoring the Eating Environment (APPAL-TREE) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): identified as a key priority population by the NIMHD, the Appalachian counties of Kentucky suffer from some of the nation's highest rates of obesity and overweight, lowest rates of produce consumption, and high rates of premature mortality and diet-related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and various cancers. With the main partnership of three community-based organizations - the Community Farm Alliance (a community development organization designed to improve food production systems). Faith Moves Mountains (a community-based research team with ten years of culturally-based intervention experience), and the Big Sandy Area Development District (a well-respected network that plans, promotes, and coordinates programs for regional economic, health, and social development of Appalachia) - and with extensive input from the Community Advisory Board (CAB), faith partners, and Cooperative Extension, this community-academic partnership proposes to address the most modifiable risk factor for these main causes of morbidity and mortality: suboptimal diet. In this three-year planning grant, the community-academic collaboration will undertake three specific aims and associated activities. In Aim 1, the project team will conduct a community needs assessment and assets inventory, hold community forums to present this information, and meet regularly with the community partners and CAB. The nutrition and agricultural economic co-investigators will partner with the community research team to use innovative and established methods, including GIS mapping, focus groups, and nutritional and economic assessment techniques. In Aim 2, community forums, CAB meetings, and collaborative engagement sessions among project partners will facilitate the selection and initiation of an evidence-based pilot intervention to promote better nutrition, emphasizing food access, particularly fruits and vegetables. In Aim 3, the community-academic collaborative will implement and evaluate this pilot intervention, tracking nutritional outcomes, participant satisfaction, and costs and reporting results to Appalachian community members.

"Impact of a Local Staple Food Ordinance on Food Choice and Calories Purchased     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this R01 is to evaluate the impact of a local policy change (i.e., the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance) that establishes minimum stocking criteria for a wide array of healthy foods as a requirement of food store licensing. Recent calls to action from the Institute of Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other authorities have identified improving access to healthy foods as a primary strategy for local governments to use in advancing obesity prevention efforts, but policy initiatives in this area have been limited. In this R01, the impact of the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance will be evaluated by assessing objectively measured changes in: (a) food environments among small, urban food stores, including availability, promotion, advertising, quality, price, and placement of both healthy and unhealthy foods and beverages, (b) nutritional quality of consumer purchases at small food stores, including assessment of energy density and calories via customer intercept surveys and direct observation of purchases and (c) home food environments, including availability of healthy and unhealthy foods/beverages and an overall home food obesogenicity score, among households that frequently shop at small stores. These changes will be assessed pre-policy implementation, as well as 4-, 12- and 24-months post-policy implementation, in two Minnesota cities: Minneapolis and St. Paul, (our control community). The proposed scope of work in this R01 is important because its takes advantage of a unique opportunity to evaluate an innovative local policy addressing a recommended action area for obesity prevention that aligns with key recommendations by leading obesity prevention authorities. To our knowledge, the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance is the only policy of its kind in the US, and as such it could serve as an important model policy for other local governments if it is successful.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving healthy food availability and decreasing the availability of high calorie, low nutrient products, particularly in underserved communities, has been identified as a leading strategy for local governments to prevent obesity. However, policy action in this area to date has been limited.

To our knowledge, this is the only policy of its kind in the US. As such, if it is successful, it could serve as an important model policy for other local governments seeking to increase healthy food availability and prevent obesity through local policy action.            ",Impact of a Local Staple Food Ordinance on Food Choice and Calories Purchased,8814919,R01DK104348,"['Advertising ', ' Beverages ', ' Bread ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food ', ' Food Processing ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infant ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Meat ', ' Minnesota ', ' Model Legislation ', ' Local Government ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Recommendation ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Licensing ', ' Policies ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' Supermarket ', ' American ', ' Intercept ', ' authority ', ' Nutrient ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' food quality ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Juice ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' obesity prevention ', ' energy density ', ' Minority ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' obesity risk ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' public health relevance ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2015,683784,0.2866897304342124
"American Indian Diabetes Prevention Center:  Impacting Health Disparity in Youth PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions); This project collaboratively forges an alternative future for American Indian people relative to diabetes.  Several disciplines are joined from within the clinical health, social, behavioral, and cultural sciences as well as native advisors to comprise the intellectual engine of this proposed center. Knitting these diverse professional cultures into an effective interdisciplinary force will be done by iterative psychoeducational seminars. The Specific Aims are to reduce health disparities among American Indian (Al) people by 1) conducting medical and sociocultural research strengthening diabetes prevention and management in the context of contemporary Al culture, 2) developing interdisciplinary values and skills pervading all operations, 3) developing curricula fostering new skills and manpower in health disparities research, 4) collaborating with Al communities to produce diabetes education in culturally appropriate ways using new, easily accessed media, and 5) administering Center operations by Al's with Al perspectives that honor all people and things. The Administrative Core is composed of the PI, Project Coordinator, Administrative Director, and two staff assistants. This Core will manage all Center functions. The Research Core has three Research Sub- Projects: 1) discovering cultural categories of parental distress due to diabetes care of children with Type 1and 2 diabetes for use in behavioral medicine counseling, 2) testing efficacy of financial incentives for increasing physical activity in obese youth and change in cardiometabolic status, and 3) comparing the differential risk for preeclampsia among Caucasian, American Indian, and Hispanic women to explore hypothesized protective effects in indigenous people of the Western hemisphere. The Research Training/Education Core will 1) develop a new certificate program in nursing on health disparity reduction research, practice, and ethics, 2) develop the capacity to produce a series of 12-minute video stories (a highly valued approach to teaching among Al's) for dissemination and evaluation, and 3) conduct education on diabetes to Al adults with integrated encouragement to serve as health disparities research subjects. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core will 1) conduct a Youth Asset building program using community, family, and individual factors that assist youth in avoiding risky health behaviors, 2) evaluate the CDC Eagle Books in public schools with high Al enrollment, and 3) add a new community partner comprised of owners of rural, small food stores to begin promoting healthy foods, and 4) continue the Oklahoma City Area Intertribal Health Board partnership of all tribes in Oklahoma. Texas, and Kansas.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project will improve the public's health by reducing the unacceptably huge diabetes health disparity crisis among Al people through finding better means to: provide clinical care in its treatment, prevent onset, reduce familial distress in chronic disease coping, develop better healthy decision-making among youth, and develop better means to  communicate healthy lifestyle choices. The project also creates a collaboration with rural, small food outlets as ""Good Food Neighbors"" to promote selling healthier foods and introduces ""digital storytelling"" appropriate to Indian

"Diet and Health Behavior Change to Improve Bone Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sabrina Noel, PhD, RD is currently a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. She has advanced training in nutrition and epidemiology and experience working in both clinical and community settings. Dr. Noel's experience with diet and metabolic health research, and exposure to work with disparities in bone health, has encouraged her to pursue a career in population-based bone research. Her goal is to evaluate the effects of dietary quality on bone health and to develop a culturally and literacy-tailored behavior change intervention targeting dietary and physical activity behaviors among Caribbean Hispanic adults. In contrast to what has been earlier believed, Hispanics have recently been shown to have higher prevalence of osteoporosis, compared with non-Hispanic whites; however, most of this research has focused on Mexican Americans because of their majority status in the U.S. Hispanic population. Caribbean origin Hispanics are one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. population and are underrepresented in bone- related research. Preliminary data from a large study of Puerto Rican adults in Boston, MA, indicates that Caribbean Hispanics are at higher risk for osteoporosis than previously thought. Identifying modifiable health behaviors, such as diet and physical activity, to prevent bone loss is an important public health priority, as adherence to bone medications is generally poor. Increasing evidence suggests that overall dietary quality is critical for bone health; however, studies that use predefined dietary patterns as a measure of overall dietary quality have reported inconsistent associations with bone outcomes. This is likely due to the fact that nutrients and foods known to be important for bone are underrepresented in these existing indices. We, therefore, propose to develop a bone-specific dietary quality index with nationally based data, and to then adapt it to include ethnic (Caribbean Latino) specific food choices related to bone health. Few theory-based interventions have targeted both dietary and physical activity behaviors to promote bone health and none that we know of have focused on overall dietary quality or on Caribbean origin Hispanic adults. This K01 award will provide Dr. Noel with training and research experience in bone health and osteoporosis prevention, health behavior theory, behavioral intervention design, implementation and evaluation, and advanced biostatistics. This training will help Dr. Noel achieve her long-term career goals of becoming a leading independent investigator in nutrition and bone health with expertise in designing and conducting culturally tailored behavioral interventions to improve bone health in diverse populations. Dr. Noel's mentors are highly committed to her career development and future success and will help her build additional knowledge and skills in bone health and intervention research. Dr. Noel's proposed research aims are to: 1) develop a bone-specific dietary quality index that emphasizes specific foods and nutrients known to be important for bone; and to evaluate the effects of a resulting dietary quality score on bone health using national survey data; 2) to adapt the index to include ethnic-specific food choices of Caribbean origin Hispanics, using data from an existing study of Puerto Rican adults, to guide the dietary component of a lifestyle behavior change intervention and; 3) to adapt and pilot test the feasibility and preliminary impact of a theory-based cultural and literacy-tailored intervention to improve dietary and physical activity behaviors among 60 Caribbean origin Hispanic adults. This bone-focused intervention will be modeled after another unique behavioral intervention, which successfully improved dietary quality and other health behaviors in low-income Caribbean Latinos. Innovative strategies, including narrative forms of communication, will be employed to help individuals adopt healthy behaviors. This work will inform a larger scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the behavioral intervention on bone outcomes in Caribbean Hispanics. This has the potential to have significant public health implications for improving bone health and preventing osteoporosis in high-risk, underserved ethnic minority populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoporosis is an increasing health concern among U.S. Hispanic adults. The proposed project will aim to reduce bone disparities in Caribbean origin Hispanic adults through a culturally- and literacy-tailored lifestyle intervention.            ",Diet and Health Behavior Change to Improve Bone Health,8869560,K01AR067894,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' bone ', ' Boston ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Food ', ' bone fracture ', ' Fracture ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' indexing ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' literacy ', ' Massachusetts ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' behavior change ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' professor ', ' bone loss ', ' Nutrient ', ' skills ', ' Cola ', ' Genus Cola ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Component ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' bone health ', ' Osteoporosis prevention ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' population based ', ' Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet ', ' DASH diet ', ' public health priorities ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,K01,2015,98067,0.11632395935736645
"Influence of Food Insecurity on Adherence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research proposal requests 3 years of support to conduct developmental intervention studies to design and field test a theory-based intervention to address food insecurity and improve antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among men and women living with HIV infection. Food insecurity is prevalent among people living with HIV in US inner-cities, with as many as 43% not having sufficient food and experiencing intermittent hunger. Food insecurity has demonstrated direct associations with ART adherence including predicting non-adherence over and above other factors including depression, social support, and alcohol use. Food insecurity is particularly problematic in relation to substance abuse given competing survival needs and the dire combined health consequences of alcoholism, addiction and malnutrition. Guided by the Conservation of Resources Theory of Stress and Coping, we will conduct 3 stages of intervention development research: (1) initial interviews and focus groups with people living with HIV who take ART, use substances, and experience food insecurity. Based on information gained from rapid formative studies, this first stage of research will be used to develop a theory-based intervention to address accessing food and sustaining ART adherence; (2) Test the feasibility of the newly developed food insecurity and adherence intervention with a small sample of HIV positive men and women who are taking ART, use substances, and experience food insecurity. Stage 2 will also finalize and pilot test all assessment instruments and protocols for data collection; and (3) Conduct a randomized field test to determine the potential efficacy of the food insecurity and ART adherence intervention. Participants in the field test will be randomly assigned to either receive the newly developed intervention or a time matched attention comparison condition. Following a 6- month follow-up period, we will test for differences between groups on ART adherence, food access, nutrition, and coping resource outcomes. The intervention development will include pilot testing daily food, mood, and substance use behaviors monitored by interactive text-message surveys. We will also examine the intervention effects on mediating theoretical constructs derived by Conservation of Resources Theory. Our developmental research will also examine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting the intervention in face-to-face intervention sessions. The proposed intervention research will therefore develop new strategies for use with people living with HIV who are taking ART under adverse conditions with multiple competing needs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lack of access to food and the intermittent experience of hunger are prevalent among people living with HIV in the United States. Effective strategies are urgently needed to assist people living with HIV to access food and sustain long- term medication adherence under the most challenging conditions. This proposal requests support to conduct developmental research to design and field test a theory-based intervention to directly address food insecurity, hunger and poor nutrition as barriers to

"Understanding the risk of obesity in food-insecure children: the hidden role of stress ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food insecurity, a household condition of limited food availability, affects 16 million US children today. Food- insecure children are at risk for adverse diet-related health conditions; however, the mechanisms underlying these associations have not been clearly identified. Chronic, psychological stress may represent an important pathway between food insecurity and childhood obesity. The effects of chronic stress on children's cognitive development and cardio-metabolic health have been well-documented. However, research of the psychological component of food insecurity is sparse. Understanding the psychosocial and cognitive mechanisms underlying children's experiences of food insecurity is important to inform the development of strategies to reduce children's food insecurity and its sequelae. I am pursuing a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award to fill critical training gaps in the areas of stress mechanisms and measurement, children's development of cognitive processes related to overeating, and causal mediation analysis. This award will build upon my advanced training as a nutrition epidemiologist and my prior research on the relations between participation in the federal food programs and diet-related chronic disease. The detailed training plan includes formal coursework at UCSF and UC Berkeley, meetings, seminars, readings, and research apprenticeships. The research component of my project will provide opportunities to integrate knowledge from these new areas. Through the proposed series of studies, I will test the hypothesis that household food insecurity increases children's psychological stress, which shapes their cognitive processes related to eating behaviors and food choice, and predicts subsequent weight gain. First, I will develop a measure to capture children's psychological stress of food insecurity, drawing from qualitative interviews with food-insecure children and existing measures of children's psychological stress. The measure's psychometric properties will be empirically tested in a separate sample of low-income children. Second, in a laboratory setting, I will determine the extent to which children's food insecurity-stress mediates the relationship between household food insecurity and children's cognitive processes related to overeating, using the newly developed measure. Finally, I will design and conduct a two- year longitudinal study to examine associations between household food insecurity and children's weight gain, and the extent to which this is mediated through the proposed pathway. This program of research will focus on children during the transition to adolescence (ages 8-12), a significant period for cognitive development and weight gain with lifelong implications. These findings will highlight a novel and important pathway to explain the adverse effects of food insecurity on children's developmental and diet-related outcomes. The proposed training plan and series of studies will provide me with a set of skills and expertise needed to successfully compete for funding as an independent investigator and to serve as a leader in developing interventions and policies to minimize food insecurity and promote health in low-income children.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Food insecurity has been linked with adverse diet-related health outcomes in children; however, the mechanisms underlying these associations are not well-understood. This project will test the hypothesis that household food insecurity promotes children's psychological stress, which shapes their cognitive processes related to eating behaviors and food choice, predicting subsequent weight gain. The proposed research may hold particular promise for interventions and policies that simultaneously address food insecurity and promote children's health.            ",Understanding the risk of obesity in food-insecure children: the hidden role of stress,8949628,K99HD084758,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Reading ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Testing ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' stressed mothers ', ' maternal stress ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Cognitive ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' obesity risk ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2015,134730,0.2226259686262015
"Pathways from Food Insecurity to Health and Treatment Outcomes in Women with HIV     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected women have higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared to men in the United States (U.S.). An important driver of health disparities and worse outcomes among HIV-infected women is food insecurity, or the inability to access food of sufficient quality or quantity in socially acceptable ways. Food insecurity affects 18 million households in the U.S. (40% of low income households), is more prevalent among women, and affects about half of urban poor HIV-infected individuals. Food insecurity is associated with worse immunologic and virologic outcomes in cross-sectional studies, increased HIV-related morbidity and mortality in longitudinal studies, and increased cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) in cross-sectional studies in the general population. Due to these negative health impacts among HIV-infected individuals, governmental and non-governmental organizations have argued to integrate food security and HIV/AIDS programming activities. A rigorous longitudinal study is urgently needed to quantify the impacts and identify the dominant mechanisms by which food insecurity negatively impacts health in order to improve the effectiveness and reach of food assistance programs and guide their integration with HIV/AIDS programs.  The proposed research assembles experts from medicine, infectious disease, immunology, biostatistics, and nutrition for a 4-year longitudinal study to quantify the impacts and identify the pathways linking food insecurity to HIV treatment and cardiovascular health in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). WIHS is an ongoing, prospective study in the U.S. of 1500 HIV-infected women and 650 non-infected, but at-risk, women. We plan to leverage the detailed HIV treatment and cardiovascular risk measures collected in WIHS to accomplish 3 aims. In aims 1 and 2, we hypothesize that food insecurity will be associated with worse HIV treatment and cardiovascular risk outcomes and that these relationships will be partially mediated by nutritional (food quality/quantity, obesity), mental health (depression, stress), and behavioral (treatment non-adherence, missed appointments) pathways. To accomplish aims 1 and 2, we will add measures of food insecurity, dietary quality, socio-economic status, competing demands between food and medical care, and antiretroviral (ARV) hair levels (a technique we pioneered as an objective measure of ARV adherence) to WIHS. Our analytic approach will be guided by a novel conceptual model that we recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. In aim 3, we hypothesize that food insecurity will be associated with markers of gut microbial translocation (MT), inflammation and immune activation among HIV-infected women, and that this association will be mediated by diet, obesity, and worse HIV control. To accomplish aim 3, we will add measures of gut MT and immune activation for a sub-sample of 250 women on ARV therapy. Our work will be critical to attract funding for this priority issue. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop sustainable solutions to tackle the intersecting challenges of food insecurity and HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality among women in the U.S.          Food insecurity is common among poor women and HIV-infected persons, and has been associated with more illness, higher risk of heart disease, and quicker decline to AIDS and death. The proposed study brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts for a 4-year study among over 2000 women to answer two key unresolved questions, namely ""What is the magnitude of the impact of food security on health?"" and ""Which mechanisms drive this impact?""

"The Intra-household Distribution of Food and Health Resources amongst Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Policies targeting health improvements for particular household members can, as a result of resource allocation adjustments, have repercussions for all household members. Understanding how these spillovers work within the household could enable the design of smarter health policies which take into account households' optimal readjustments. But we cannot fully measure these reallocation responses without data on dietary intake, which is arguably the most important health resource, especially for children in low-income settings. I propose to 1) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to collect such data, and 2) use it to analyze the effects of nutrition interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources.  To accomplish the first goal, I will engage in three training activities which will enable me to learn about key concepts in nutritional science and measurement issues in dietary intake assessment in low-income settings: 1) coursework, 2) mentoring meetings, and 3) dissemination of my work. To accomplish the second, I will engage in a research program related to understanding the intra-household spillovers of targeted nutrition interventions, focusing on iodine supplementation.  Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) has significant and irreversible effects on cognitive development.  One third of the global population has IDD. Low in utero exposure to iodine leads to reduced intelligence quotients, and in severe cases can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery and growth, hearing and speech problems. Iodine supplementation and fortification programs-both in utero and in early childhood-have been proven to increase child health and cognitive ability, and are thus often used as policy tools in affected areas. Supplementation programs are usually targeted towards pregnant women and young children. However, little is known about how these interventions affect other children in the household who are not targeted.  My research program has 3 specific aims: 1) collect novel data which combine socioeconomic and demographic information with dietary intake measurements for every child in the household; 2) document the patterns of intra-household allocation of food and other health resources; and 3) study the effects of fetal and early childhood iodine supplementation interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources amongst children.  I will accomplish the first aim by designing a dietary intake assessment module and integrating it into a large-scale household panel survey in Ghana. I will accomplish Aim 2 by performing preliminary analyses with these new data. I will accomplish the last aim through two studies. In the first, I will study the effects of a large feta iodine supplementation program in Tanzania using an existing, nationally representative dataset. In this study, I will apply econometric techniques developed for intra-household analyses to examine whether children exposed to more iodine while in utero receive more health resources than their untreated siblings during childhood. In the second study, I will implement and analyze data from a pilot field experiment that will distribute iodine supplements to children under 5 in Ghana. The experiment will run concurrently with the panel survey data collection, allowing me to measure the resulting changes in dietary intake and other health resource allocations.  Without quantifying the household responses to childhood nutrition interventions, particularly in the context of iodine supplementation policies, it is impossible to know the full impact of these programs. Answering this question-are we helping or hurting other children in the household through targeted interventions?-is essential to the design and improved cost-benefit analysis of childhood nutrition programs around the world. It is impossible to gauge the full impacts of childhood nutrition interventions without measuring how households redistribute resources among children in response.

"Proposed Meal Changes for CACFP: Impact on Child Food Intake and Costs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Revised Federal School Meal Guidelines: Impact on Student Food Intake and Costs CACFP meals are an important influence on diets of children from low-income families enrolled in the CACFP and should meet children's nutrient needs while fostering healthy eating habits that enable them to maintain energy balance. Recent national data revealed that children consumed low intakes of foods that support healthy dietary patterns (whole grains, fruit and vegetables other than potatoes), but high intakes of low nutrient, energy dense foods. The 2011 USDA-commissioned Institute of Medicine (IOM) report for CACFP meals provided new recommendations that include new meal pattern requirements for the meals programs, aligning them with the U.S. Dietary Guidelines to ensure that the meals promote health and reduce inadequate and excessive intakes. The report recommended inclusion of more whole grains, fruit, vegetables, and meat/meat alternatives which will likely increase meal costs. Two of the IOM report recommendations call for research to better understand how the new meal requirements would change children's CACFP meal dietary intakes and food service costs. These are important questions, and answers are needed to inform policy and future technical and educational assistance needs. The overall objective of this R01 grant application is to implement the IOM meal pattern requirements for CACFP meals in day homes and centers in Texas. Our multidisciplinary team will focus on nutrition, economics, and provider outcomes. The specific aims are to assess the impact of the new meal pattern requirements on 1) Meal participation rates; 2) Provider food service costs (food, labor, total meals); and 3) Child dietary intake at CACFP homes and centers. We hypothesize that, compared with control schools; intervention school students will select and consume healthier diets (more fruit, vegetables and whole grains) at school. We will collaborate with the Southwest Human Development Services, Inc. and recruit a total of 16 day care homes and 16 day care centers for the proposed study. We hypothesize that, compared with control sites; children at the intervention sites will select and consume healthier diets (more fruit, vegetable and whole grains) at the center. We also hypothesize that the increase in food costs will be less than that projected in the IOM report. The results on the costs associated with creating the desired meals will be very important as these data have not been systematically collected in previous studies. This significant study targets underserved minority populations with health promoting intervention to reduce health disparities, and in addition, will inform policy on the influence of  healthy food environment on children's diet, as well as provide critical information on costs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application will implement the new IOM meal pattern requirements for CACFP meals promoting whole grain, fruit, vegetables, and meat/meat alternatives in day care centers and homes. Outcomes from this study will identify what changes in children's dietary behaviors occur at CACFP mealtime as a result of the new meal patterns, identify the financial impact on the meal cost, and inform policy.            ",Proposed Meal Changes for CACFP: Impact on Child Food Intake and Costs,8817412,R01HL119520,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' pediatric nutrition ', ' Child Nutrition ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Treatment Day Care ', ' Partial Hospitalization ', ' Day Care ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food ', ' Food Services ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Human Development ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Meat ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Potato ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Ensure ', ' sugar ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' Outcome Study ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' energy balance ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Nutrient ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Day center care ', ' Trans Fats ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Intake ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Process ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' economic outcome ', ' public health relevance ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2015,666214,0.2200014626846133
"Impact of Racially Targeted Food and Beverage Ads on Adolescent Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and diabetes pose significant and costly threats to public health in the United States. Food and beverage marketing has been identified as a major driver of obesity and diabetes, with the majority of advertisements promoting sugary beverages and energy-dense, nutrient-poor food products. Studies show children exposed to food advertisements are more likely to request the advertised food, express preference for the advertised food, and consume more food. Adolescents also represent a key target for marketers because of their buying power and influence over parent purchases. African American and Hispanic adolescents are especially highly targeted consumers because they are perceived by marketers to be ""cultural trendsetters."" Adolescents are exposed to food and beverage advertisements through traditional forms of media, and increasingly, through digital media and social networking websites. To assess how exposure to racially-targeted food and beverage advertisements affects adolescents' food choices and perceptions of products, this study will examine adolescents' ratings of advertisements and featured products, and how exposure to advertisements affects dietary choices. Data collection will occur online through Survey Sampling International's database of participants (Aim 1 and 2, outcomes are ratings of advertisements and willingness to engage in marketing promotions) and through community organizations that serve adolescents (Aim 3, outcomes are advertising ratings and actual food choices). Subjects will be male and female adolescents ages 12-17 years who identify as African American, Hispanic, or White, and a subset of the participants will speak Spanish and English. These data will capture how racially-targeted advertisements affect adolescents' food and beverage choices and perceptions of food and beverage products.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is one of the most complex and costly public health problems in the United States, and food marketing has been identified as a significant driver of obesity.

"Race, Socioeconomic Status, Diet and Chronic Kidney Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are most profound among persons of low socioeconomic status (SES), and dietary factors (limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy dietary patterns) likely underlie much of this disparit. Low SES African Americans (AAs) are more likely to experience food insecurity (the inability to afford nutritionally adequate and safe foods) and live in ""food deserts"" (areas where low-income residents do not have access to healthy food and fast food restaurants predominate) which likely contributes to racial differences in dietary patterns. Little is known regarding the potentil effectiveness of dietary interventions among low SES AAs at high risk for CKD incidence or progression. Studies quantifying the association between poor diet and disparities in CKD incidence and progression among low SES AAs and identifying effective strategies to improve dietary habits in this population are critically needed, and could lead to reduced racial disparitis in CKD. The overall objectives of this proposal are to 1) determine the contribution of racial differences in dietary patterns to racial disparities in progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) among low SES individuals in a national population-based study; 2) examine the impact of availability of healthy foods on the effectiveness of a patient, family and community level intervention among low SES AAs with uncontrolled hypertension by using established measures and developing a novel measure of healthy food availability within AAs' homes; 3) identify perceived barriers to healthy dietary patterns and identify potential interventional strategies deemed acceptable among low SES AAs at very high risk for CKD using qualitative methodology; and 4) develop and pilot-test a tailored dietary intervention for low SES AAs at very high risk for CKD by employing the principles of community-based participatory research. The candidate for this K23 Mentored Career Development Award, Dr. Deidra Crews, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Nephrology at Johns Hopkins University and an Associate Faculty Member at the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research. Her long term goal is to improve health outcomes among vulnerable populations through her work as a clinical investigator. The overarching goal of this application is to establish her successful and independent career studying mechanisms to narrow racial disparities in CKD. Under the guidance of exceptional mentors and advisors, Dr. Crews will extend her prior training and work in clinical epidemiology and health disparities research through further didactic training in nutrition, clinical trials and community-based participatory research, and through the performance of novel, complementary studies. She will conduct this work in the rich training environment of the Welch Center, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the Hopkins Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Health Disparities. Dr. Crews' proposed work will not only assure her successful transition to an R01-funded independent investigator, but will also contribute substantially to what is known about racial and socioeconomic disparities in CKD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are disproportionately affected by chronic kidney disease in the United States, and this disparity is particularly apparent among socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans. Limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy dietary patterns likely contribute to this disparity, and represent modifiable targets fo the prevention of chronic kidney disease in this population.","Race, Socioeconomic Status, Diet and Chronic Kidney Disease",9054832,K23DK097184,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' National Center for Health Statistics ', ' NCHS ', ' United States National Center for Health Statistics ', ' Nephrology ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Diet Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' Funding ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' member ', ' Study Subject ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' hypertension control ', ' DASH diet ', ' Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' dietary approach ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' associate professor ', ' associate faculty ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,169740,0.04814115658787164
"Designing Food Voucher Programs to Reduce Disparities in Healthy Diets Abstract Improving diets through increased food and vegetable (F&V) consumption significantly reduces the risk of car- diovascular disease (CVD). Programs increasing the accessibility and affordability of F&Vs among low-income Americans have been hindered by the food consumption cycle associated with poverty: the tendency to over-consume calories shortly after receiving funds at the beginning of each month, draining the budget for F&V purchases, or for all food purchases, by month's end. Increasing food assistance funding alone does not resolve this problem, but an emerging theory about dietary behavior suggests that providing funds for food in smaller installments distributed throughout the month will smooth the consumption cycle and improve healthy eating—counteracting the tendency to respond to lump sum, once-monthly funding installments by purchasing calorie-dense foods immediately after funds are received. The theory also suggests that funds tar- geted toward specific healthy foods (e.g., F&Vs) will improve diets more than untargeted funds, despite the in- convenience of utilizing targeted funds. Our preliminary data support both hypotheses, which we will rigor- ously test in a real-world setting by comparing alternative approaches for delivering food purchasing vouchers. We have established and tested the infrastructure to provide vouchers accepted by all major food stores (e.g., supermarkets, corner shops) in two low-income neighborhoods. Leveraging this innovative infrastructure, in Aim 1 we propose a randomized trial with a two-by-two factorial design, comparing $20 of vouchers valid for one month to four $5 vouchers each valid for a sequential week of the month (lump sum versus distributed funding), and comparing vouchers restricted to F&V purchases to vouchers redeemable for any food (targeted versus untargeted funding). Low-income adults (N=288) recruited through our community partners will be ran- domized to one of four 6-month interventions: monthly targeted, monthly untargeted, weekly targeted, or week- ly untargeted vouchers. Participants will be assessed through efficient verbal 24-hour dietary recalls validated among low-literacy populations, to determine daily consumption of F&Vs and metrics of overall dietary quality at months 0, 6 and 12 (6 months after vouchers end). Additional surveys will identify moderators and mediators of dietary improvement. In Aim 2, we will calculate the cost-effectiveness of the voucher programs. Vouchers and other interventions that support healthy diets reduce population-level CVD disparities over the course of decades. Hence, the full costs and benefits of such interventions are not possible to directly observe through time-limited trials. Following recent NIH policy statements, we will overcome this problem by applying an inno- vative, validated microsimulation modeling approach—a systems science method that integrates trial results with comprehensive data on the effect of dietary changes on CVD risks and costs over the life course. We will identify which voucher delivery strategies cost-effectively reduce CVD disparities—addressing a key scientific uncertainty in healthy eating intervention research. Public health relevance This study tackles a stubborn scientific issue—how to design and implement cost-effective interventions to support healthy eating among low-income populations—in an effort to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities between low- and higher-income Americans. We will test two hypotheses: that increasing the fre- quency of food assistance but not the overall amount of the assistance, and targeting such assistance towards healthy fruits and vegetables, increases dietary quality in a manner that can cost-effectively reduce CVD dis- parities. Our test of both hypotheses is of potentially high impact and timely, as 1 in 7 Americans are current- ly enrolled in nutrition programs that use monthly, untargeted funding approaches, but program directors are considering new approaches to reduce disparities in healthy diets through program modifications.",Designing Food Voucher Programs to Reduce Disparities in Healthy Diets,9146719,R01HL132814,"['Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' parity ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Tars ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vegetables ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' improved ', ' farmer ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' Supermarket ', ' American ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' voucher ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Sum ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Low Literacy Population ', ' Modification ', ' food consumption ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' federal poverty level ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' public health relevance ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' abstracting ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Budgets ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Low Income Population ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,784413,0.1733071723342179
"The Influence of Quick-Service Restaurants on Children's Diets 7. Project Summary/Abstract Addressing childhood obesity remains one of the greatest public health priorities in the U.S., particularly among minority and lower socioeconomic status (SES) populations where the prevalence of obesity is highest. Studies have found a positive association between quick-service restaurant (QSR) food consumption and body mass index (BMI) among children. This is likely due in part to the high caloric content of foods from QSRs, especially the traditional side dishes and beverages (i.e. fried potato products and sugar-sweetened beverages) which can provide up to 350 additional calories per children’s meal compared with the healthier options available. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence the selection of healthier or less healthy children’s meal side dishes and beverages can have important implications for addressing obesity and health disparities. The proposed research will examine QSR environments (both the physical environment and verbal prompts), as well as parent-child interactions, that promote or discourage the selection of healthier children’s meal side dishes/ beverages. Additionally, we will analyze the impact of healthier side dish/beverage selection on overall meal consumption. Environmental assessments will occur in 136 QSRs in socioeconomically and ethnically diverse communities. Interactions when ordering will be observed among 64 parent-child pairs, and overall meal consumption will be assessed using plate waste methodology among 850 children. Expanding upon Dr. Cohen’s prior nutrition and plate waste research in low-income school districts, this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide additional training in behavior change techniques, qualitative data collection, analyses involving mixed-methods, behavioral/ family-centered theories, and conducting research to address health disparities. Dr. Cohen has the full support of The School of Science and Engineering at Merrimack College, as well as her exceptional, multidisciplinary team of mentors, who are committed to helping Dr. Cohen successfully complete the proposed training and research and become a successful independent researcher. Study results will be used to inform future intervention studies involving both QSRs and families to improve children’s selection/consumption of healthier QSR foods. This award will provide Dr. Cohen with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator conducting cross- disciplinary research that uses behavior change techniques and is informed by studying both environmental influences and the role of parents (applying qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research) to improve the diets of underserved children and reduced their risk of obesity. 8. Project Narrative Children frequently consume foods from quick-service restaurants, which are associated with increased risk of overweight; therefore research is needed to better understand how to improve food selections in this environment. This study will examine the influence of quick-service restaurant environments, as well as parent-child interactions in the restaurants, on children’s side dish and beverage selection and meal consumption. This research will provide an important foundation towards addressing childhood obesity and health disparities, and will improve the diets children in quick-service restaurants.",The Influence of Quick-Service Restaurants on Children's Diets,9179785,K01DK107810,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Award ', ' Beverages ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Selections ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parents ', ' Potato ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' base ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Visual ', ' wasting ', ' sugar ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Calories ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' behavior change ', ' Physical environment ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' saturated fat ', ' Employee ', ' Nutrient ', ' skills ', ' parent role ', ' parental role ', ' theories ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' Food Energy ', ' food consumption ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' obesity risk ', ' parental involvement ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health priorities ', ' school district ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ']",NIDDK,MERRIMACK COLLEGE,K01,2016,127904,0.19343240252340535
"Impact of a Local Staple Food Ordinance on Food Choice and Calories Purchased DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this R01 is to evaluate the impact of a local policy change (i.e., the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance) that establishes minimum stocking criteria for a wide array of healthy foods as a requirement of food store licensing. Recent calls to action from the Institute of Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other authorities have identified improving access to healthy foods as a primary strategy for local governments to use in advancing obesity prevention efforts, but policy initiatives in this area have been limited. In this R01, the impact of the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance will be evaluated by assessing objectively measured changes in: (a) food environments among small, urban food stores, including availability, promotion, advertising, quality, price, and placement of both healthy and unhealthy foods and beverages, (b) nutritional quality of consumer purchases at small food stores, including assessment of energy density and calories via customer intercept surveys and direct observation of purchases and (c) home food environments, including availability of healthy and unhealthy foods/beverages and an overall home food obesogenicity score, among households that frequently shop at small stores. These changes will be assessed pre-policy implementation, as well as 4-, 12- and 24-months post-policy implementation, in two Minnesota cities: Minneapolis and St. Paul, (our control community). The proposed scope of work in this R01 is important because its takes advantage of a unique opportunity to evaluate an innovative local policy addressing a recommended action area for obesity prevention that aligns with key recommendations by leading obesity prevention authorities. To our knowledge, the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance is the only policy of its kind in the US, and as such it could serve as an important model policy for other local governments if it is successful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving healthy food availability and decreasing the availability of high calorie, low nutrient products, particularly in underserved communities, has been identified as a leading strategy for local governments to prevent obesity. However, policy action in this area to date has been limited.

"SES and race-ethnic disparities in food purchasing and dietary intake:2000-2015 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SES and race-ethnic disparities of food purchasing and dietary intake: 2000-2015 Our primary goals are to use in-depth descriptive and longitudinal analyses of shift in food purchases among critical race/ethnic and SES subpopulations to examine the impact of the Great Recession (beginning in 2007), and other SES factors on short-term and long-term food purchase and dietary outcomes. In addition, we will seek to understand factors determining how our key subpopulations select the consumer packaged goods sector (CPGs) foods and beverages they purchase and how this affects their nutrient intake. Food purchase and dietary outcomes include nutritional quality (calories, sodium, saturated fat and added sugars), and patterns (focusing on selected subgroups of foods considered to contain large proportions of empty calories, and away-from-home intakes). Using data purchased under separate funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), the UNC Food Research Program (UNCFRP) has created a longitudinal file of Nielsen Homescan household purchase data from 2000-2012, and we propose to expand this work to later years and additional analyses under this grant. We examine a number of key issues related to the diets of key minority (Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites) and lower income subpopulations. We will use longitudinal commercial data on CPG food and beverage purchases by a nationally representative sample of 35,000 to 60,000 households in each quarter linked with nutrition facts panel data at the barcode level. With a unique crosswalk, we link these commercial data to the publicly available What We Eat in America (WWEIA) dietary intake interview component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) and the US Department of Agriculture nutrient databases. We will implement established linear programming methods to estimate added sugar content of all commercial CPG products (706,451 items in 2000-10 alone). We use longitudinal methods, correct for endogeneity in selection of various types of stores (convenience, grocery, mass merchandisers/supercenters, and warehouse/club stores), account for dynamics in market shares of branded vs. private label products, and examine other issues relevant to dynamics of food purchase and diet among race-ethnic, age and income subpopulations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to evaluate how an array of economic changes, including the Great Recession, may have differentially affected the nutrient composition of consumer package foods and beverages purchases from various categories of food stores, branded vs. private label brands by critical subpopulations. In addition, we will link these changes to individual dietary intake changes in national dietary intake to understand what these changes mean for trends and patterns in access to and intake of key foods and nutrients.

"The Effect of Food Marketing and Attentional Biases on Eating behaviors in the African American Adolescent Girls ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIMHD Strategic Plan proposes a critical focus on studying underlying factors contributing to health disparities, such as obesity, among racial/ethnic minorities. The proposed Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA is a two-year program of research and training focused on uncovering the underlying associations among environmental, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to obesity health disparities among African American (AA) adolescent girls. Rates of overweight/obesity and related comorbidities among AA adolescent girls are much higher than rates in other racial/ethnic groups, highlighting a critical health disparity. AAs who are obese are more likely to remain obese through adulthood and develop health consequences, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Therefore, preventing overweight/obesity in this group is critical. Yet, prevention and intervention efforts must account for the multiple systems that influence obesity risk, specifically individual and environmental factors. AA individuals may be more vulnerable to environmental factors, such as food marketing, compared to other groups. Obese AA adolescents may be more prone to over-attention toward food-related stimuli (i.e., attentional biases [ABs]) increasing the potential rol of food marketing. Together, these factors may lead to unhealthy eating behaviors and increase obesity risk. Among 120 AA obese (n=60) and non-overweight (n=60) adolescent girls, the proposed project will examine the effect of food marketing and ABs on eating behaviors. Food cue ABs will be examined using an attention bias visual dot probe task. Afterwards, AA girls will view a video clip embedded with either a food commercial or a neutral/non-food commercial. Eating behavior will be assessed using a laboratory test meal. This study will evaluate the hypotheses that food marketing and ABs individually impact food consumption among AA adolescent girls. Further, we expect that girls who view the food commercial and have high ABs will consume more overall food. Findings from the proposed study will elucidate the associations among environmental, cognitive, and behavioral factors that may contribute to obesity risk in AA adolescent girls. If successful, this project may assist in identifying individual and environmenta targets for obesity prevention, such as attentional retraining and limits on youth-targeted food marketing, respectively. Data have the potential to build scientific support towards important regulatory policies to encourage alignment of marketing with nutritional guidelines and limits on food marketing towards youth and racial/ethnic minorities. The proposed NRSA will provide conceptual, technical, and professional skills training in understanding socio-ecological factors within health disparities research, psychological theories that drive marketing techniques, ABs, and ways to disseminate research to inform policy. The innovative integration of food marketing, an ABs paradigm, and a laboratory test meal will elucidate how the current food environment, food-related cognitions, and eating behaviors interact to contribute to the development and maintenance of obesity risk in AA girls, a vulnerable group.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American adolescent girls have the highest obesity rates of all other racial/ethnic youth. More food advertisements that promote unhealthy foods are shown to African Americans compared to other groups, which may lead to unhealthy eating and obesity, especially among African American girls who pay more attention to food images than any other images in their environment. Results from this study may help determine individual and environmental changes that must be made in order to reduce these effects in African American girls.        ",The Effect of Food Marketing and Attentional Biases on Eating behaviors in the African American Adolescent Girls,9126868,F31MD010675,"['Accounting ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Advertising ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cartoons ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Cues ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Preferences ', ' Health ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Marketing ', ' Motivation ', ' Music ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Precipitating Factors ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Television ', ' Testing ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Clip ', ' density ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' skills training ', ' Participant ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' food craving ', ' Advertisements ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' NRSA ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' food consumption ', ' environmental change ', ' obesity prevention ', ' food advertising ', ' food ads ', ' food marketing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Non obese ', ' Nonobese ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' obesity risk ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' nutritional guideline ', ' food environment ', ' cognitive process ', ' attentional bias ', ' sustained attention ', ' Adolescent obesity ', ' obesity among adolescents ', ' obese adolescents ', ' ']",NIMHD,HENRY M.

"The Intra-household Distribution of Food and Health Resources amongst Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Policies targeting health improvements for particular household members can, as a result of resource allocation adjustments, have repercussions for all household members. Understanding how these spillovers work within the household could enable the design of smarter health policies which take into account households' optimal readjustments. But we cannot fully measure these reallocation responses without data on dietary intake, which is arguably the most important health resource, especially for children in low-income settings. I propose to 1) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to collect such data, and 2) use it to analyze the effects of nutrition interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources.  To accomplish the first goal, I will engage in three training activities which will enable me to learn about key concepts in nutritional science and measurement issues in dietary intake assessment in low-income settings: 1) coursework, 2) mentoring meetings, and 3) dissemination of my work. To accomplish the second, I will engage in a research program related to understanding the intra-household spillovers of targeted nutrition interventions, focusing on iodine supplementation.  Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) has significant and irreversible effects on cognitive development.  One third of the global population has IDD. Low in utero exposure to iodine leads to reduced intelligence quotients, and in severe cases can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery and growth, hearing and speech problems. Iodine supplementation and fortification programs-both in utero and in early childhood-have been proven to increase child health and cognitive ability, and are thus often used as policy tools in affected areas. Supplementation programs are usually targeted towards pregnant women and young children. However, little is known about how these interventions affect other children in the household who are not targeted.  My research program has 3 specific aims: 1) collect novel data which combine socioeconomic and demographic information with dietary intake measurements for every child in the household; 2) document the patterns of intra-household allocation of food and other health resources; and 3) study the effects of fetal and early childhood iodine supplementation interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources amongst children.  I will accomplish the first aim by designing a dietary intake assessment module and integrating it into a large-scale household panel survey in Ghana. I will accomplish Aim 2 by performing preliminary analyses with these new data. I will accomplish the last aim through two studies. In the first, I will study the effects of a large feta iodine supplementation program in Tanzania using an existing, nationally representative dataset. In this study, I will apply econometric techniques developed for intra-household analyses to examine whether children exposed to more iodine while in utero receive more health resources than their untreated siblings during childhood. In the second study, I will implement and analyze data from a pilot field experiment that will distribute iodine supplements to children under 5 in Ghana. The experiment will run concurrently with the panel survey data collection, allowing me to measure the resulting changes in dietary intake and other health resource allocations.  Without quantifying the household responses to childhood nutrition interventions, particularly in the context of iodine supplementation policies, it is impossible to know the full impact of these programs. Answering this question-are we helping or hurting other children in the household through targeted interventions?-is essential to the design and improved cost-benefit analysis of childhood nutrition programs around the world. It is impossible to gauge the full impacts of childhood nutrition interventions without measuring how households redistribute resources among children in response.

In the short term, she aims to build on this work, investigating the effect of gender inequality and food insecurity on maternal and child health outcomes in newly married women in Nepal. In the long term, she aspires to conduct research that results in interventions that will improve gender inequality and food access, and ultimately improve maternal and child health outcomes for women across their life course, with a focus on the pre-conception period. The knowledge and experience she will gain from this K01 award will prepare her to compete for NICHD R01 funding to test the household level behavior change and food insecurity intervention to address household dynamics around women's empowerment and access to food and nutrition in Nepal developed in this proposal in a randomized intervention trial. Environment: The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) provides generous support for junior faculty. UCSF researchers have a long history of pursuing innovative ideas in reproductive health, studying food insecurity, and working in low and middle-income countries. Key Elements of Research Career Development Plan: Dr. Diamond-Smith has a strong background in public health (epidemiology and biostatistics) and demographic methods, with substantial experience analyzing large datasets and conducting qualitative data. This career development award will enable her to address several remaining gaps in her training specific to her career goals, and to gain applied experience planning and executing a primary data collection study on gender inequality and food insecurity, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. She seeks training in (1) maternal and child nutrition and food insecurity; (2) women's empowerment theory and measurement; and (3) implementation sciences, including designing behavioral interventions and evaluating interventions. To achieve these goals, Dr. Diamond-Smith has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team. It includes her Primary Mentor, Sheri Weiser, MD, MPH, in the School of Medicine at UCSF with a secondary appointment in Global Health Sciences at UCSF, who has extensive experience conducting research and developing interventions on food insecurity and health outcomes, and co-mentor Mallory Johnson, PhD, a Clinical Health Psychologist in UCSF's School of Medicine and an expert behavior change interventions and intervention design and evaluation. Her team includes three additional, complementary advisors: Cynthia Harper, PhD, in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at UCSF, with an expertise in demography and women's reproductive health and experience working in Nepal; Anita Raj, PhD, in the Division of Global Public Health, Department of Medicine, at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), with training in Developmental Psychology and extensive experience in South Asia on topics including sexual and reproductive health, maternal and child health, and gender based violence; and George W. Rutherford, MD, Vice Chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the School of Medicine at UCSF, with expertise in pediatric epidemiology and interventions to improve child health. Dr. Diamond-Smith's training will include a combination of structured reading lists and tutorials with mentors, coursework, workshops, conference presentations and attendance, and seminars. Description of the Research Project: Women and children in Nepal are especially vulnerable to malnutrition, which I hypothesize is due to pervasive gender inequality across women's life course combined with food insecurity at the individual and household level. I hypothesize that household dynamics around women's empowerment and access to food are especially crucial in the pre-conception period. The overall objective of this study is to examine the pathways between gender inequality, food insecurity, and maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) in newly married households in Nepal and to adapt an existing intervention to this population. My main hypothesis is that gender inequality and food insecurity intersect to compromise pre- conception health, which in turn contributes to poor MNCH. This research will assess this hypothesis through three specific aims. In Aim 1, I will conduct qualitative interviews with newly married women, their husbands, and mothers-in-law to understand the interactions between gender inequality and food insecurity at the household level. In Aim 2, I will collect longitudinal data with newly married women for 18 months to evaluate how household gender dynamics and food insecurity impact maternal and child health and change in the first 18 months of marriage. In Aim 3, I will build off an existing food insecurity intervention developed by Helen Keller International, to adapt it for newly married women and their households and include an empowerment component, and test the feasibility of this intervention in a small subset of households. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare me for the successful submission of an R01 application to test the intervention developed in Aim 3 in a larger population. Project Narrative In Nepal in 2011 about 30% of children and 27% of women were underweight and just over 50% of household reported some level of food insecurity. Nepal has high levels of gender inequality, reinforced by house dynamics, where young, newly married women have especially low status in the household and are at increased risk of poor health outcomes, yet little research and few interventions have focused on this population. The knowledge gained and the intervention designed in this study will help improve maternal and child health by addressing the intersection of gender inequality and food insecurity among newly married households in Nepal.",Understanding the role of gender inequality and food insecurity on maternal and child health,9180433,K01HD086281,"['abstracting ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Appointment ', ' Asia ', '

"Pathways contributing to racial disparities in HIV virologic response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) currently experience an inequitable burden of adverse HIV-related outcomes in the United States (U.S.). Such adverse outcomes include infection, AIDS diagnoses, virologic failure, and death. One of the three goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the U.S. issued by the White House in 2010 was to permanently reduce long-standing health disparities in HIV-disease, in particular racial/ethnic disparities. Identifying the major pathways that mediate HIV racial/ethnic disparities is critical or prioritizing targets for effective interventions to achieve this goal. Differential use (i.e., initation, modification, and adherence) of antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) by race may be a main mediator of observed racial disparities in adverse HIV- related outcomes between AAs and Caucasians in the U.S. However, short-term interventions (e.g., education programs) solely and directly targeted at improving ART initiation and adherence among AAs who have been observed to receive and adhere to ART less often than Caucasians may be insufficient to permanently reduce racial differences in adverse HIV-related outcomes. Therefore, to meet the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, more upstream, distal factors potentially influenced by race that likely directly or indirectly effect ART use and in turn HIV-related outcomes should be evaluated as important mediators of HIV racial disparities. As such, the goal of the proposed research is to establish whether inadequate insurance and food insecurity are important, more distal mediators through which a substantial proportion of differences in virologic response between HIV-infected AA and Caucasian adults in the U.S. operate. Existing and to be collected data from AA and Caucasian participants enrolled in the large, racially and geographically diverse Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) combined HIV clinic cohort (R24 AI067039; M. Saag, PI; www.uab.edu/cnics/) will be used for the proposed study. Specifically, this study aims to (1) examine if and quantify the degree to which food insecurity mediates racial differences in HIV clinic attendance, (2) examine if and quantify the degree to which inadequate insurance and food insecurity mediate racial differences in virologic response, and (3) examine if and quantify the degree to which HIV clinic attendance mediates differences in virologic response by food insecurity. Novel quantitative methods for causal mediation analysis based on the counterfactual framework will be used to estimate total, direct, and indirect effects and in turn the relevant proportion mediated for all proposed mediation analyses. We expect that completing the proposed aims will establish whether food insecurity and inadequate insurance represent important, more distal mediators of HIV racial disparities that should be prioritized as targets when developing effective interventions to achieve the health disparities goals of the 2010 U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will establish if and quantify the extent to which inadequate insurance and food insecurity contribute to substantial and long-standing racial differences in virologic response between HIV-infected African American and Caucasian adults in the United States. Completing this work will provide policymakers with critical evidence necessary to determine whether inadequate insurance and food insecurity represent priority intervention targets for achieving the health disparities goals of the 2010 White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy.",Pathways contributing to racial disparities in HIV virologic response,9315350,R56AI120830,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Housing ', ' Infection ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' AIDS diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Modification ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effective intervention ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' ']",NIAID,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R56,2016,466591,0.052371271502499005
"A Systems Science Approach to Understanding Racial/Ethnic Dispartities in Obesity ABSTRACT Identifying effective strategies for reducing obesity is critical for alleviating the unequal burden of obesity and related adverse cardiopulmonary and sleep outcomes facing black and Hispanic women in the U.S. Studies typically focus on identifying independent effects of individual and environmental factors on obesity, but this approach overlooks important inter-relationships between these factors. This is challenging to model using traditional regression modeling approaches which are not well equipped to handle the complex ways individuals interact with their environments. Systems science approaches were promoted in two recent reports released by the Institute of Medicine and are part of the NHLBI Strategic Research Priorities because predictive and simulation-based models can both elucidate the complex inter-relationships between social, economic, and environmental causes of poor health and assess the benefits and harms of policy and intervention options. Thus, the overall goal of this application is to use a systems science methodology, agent- based modeling, to understand how individual-level behaviors and psychosocial factors interact with characteristics of the food environment to influence eating behaviors and obesity. This goal will be accomplished by executing the following aims: 1) to examine associations of food store characteristics with body mass index among Hispanic, black and white women; 2) to develop an exploratory agent-based model that simulates the emergence of racial/ethnic disparities in obesity among women; and 3) to investigate the effectiveness of potential multi-level interventions to reduce obesity. The candidate, Kiarri Kershaw, is an Assistant Professor of Preventive Medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Her strong training in general epidemiology, social epidemiology, and population health has allowed her to pursue a research agenda focused on racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and place-based disparities in cardiovascular disease risk factors. The K01 award will allow her to build on her current training by providing her with protected time to collect data on factors that influence lifestyle choices and to build and test an initial agent- based simulation. It will also allow her to learn how to work with community stakeholders and policymakers in order to develop research studies with a greater potential to translate into public health improvements. This training will help Dr. Kershaw achieve her long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program that focuses on how inter-relationships between individuals and their environments influence disparities in CVD risk. RELEVANCE: The results of this research project and future studies will allow for the development of effective, comprehensive multi-level interventions to promote cardiovascular health by reducing racial/ethnic disparities in obesity. Specifically, the execution of these aims will lead to an improved understanding of the dynamic inter-relationships between individuals and their environments that contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in eating behaviors and obesity.",A Systems Science Approach to Understanding Racial/Ethnic Dispartities in Obesity,9166868,K01HL133531,"['Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Local Government ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' tool ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' Physical environment ', ' professor ', ' Nutrient ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' systematic review ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population health ', ' food environment ', ' public health intervention ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2016,133507,0.04161319743019387
"Understanding & Overcoming Food Insecurity in Diabetes Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food insecurity, defined as difficulty affording an adequate diet owing to cost, affects over 20% of the 29 million Americans with diabetes. Food insecurity is an important socioeconomic barrier to effective diabetes care: it is associated with worse diabetes control and increased emergency department visits and hospitalization. By incentivizing consumption of calorie-dense foods high in simple carbohydrates and saturated fats, instead of more expensive fresh produce and whole grains, food insecurity may undermine healthy diets that are crucial for diabetes management. This project will help advance our knowledge of the relationship between food insecurity and diabetes by identifying how food insecurity affects current diabetes management and examining the clinical effects of using different strategies to overcome it. Fundamental questions regarding the mechanisms underlying potential interventions remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To determine the impact of food insecurity on a lifestyle change intervention: the REAL HEALTH Diabetes trial (R18 DK102737 NCT02320253), a pragmatic adaptation of the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention to community health centers, 2)To estimate the effect of nutrition assistance program use on diabetes control for patients in a primary care network, and 3) To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility of home-delivered medically tailored meals for food insecure diabetes patients with hyperglycemia. This research program complements the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' strategic focus on translating clinical research to practice by overcoming barriers faced by patients in real-world settings, reducing disparities in special populations, making care more patient-centered, and innovating within systems of care. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in understanding how socioeconomic barriers affect diabetes management and pragmatic interventions to overcome them. Career development activities include training in advanced analytic methods and intervention design through formal coursework as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will fill important knowledge gaps, and help improve diabetes management and reduce diabetes complications in patients with food insecurity.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Over 29 million Americans have diabetes, and 1 in 5, nearly 6 million, report food insecurity, or difficulty accessing nutritious food owing to cost. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of the role food insecurity plays in diabetes management, and assess 2 strategies to address food insecurity in diabetes patients: 1) improving food access using nutritional assistance programs, and 2) directly providing medically tailored meals. This program has the potential to expand partnerships between healthcare systems and community organizations, and may reduce the impact of food insecurity among vulnerable diabetes patients        ",Understanding & Overcoming Food Insecurity in Diabetes Patients,9087461,K23DK109200,"['Affect ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' digestive tract disease ', ' digestive disorder ', ' GI tract disorder ', ' Digestive System Diseases ', ' Digestive Diseases ', ' Digestive System Disorders ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' indexing ', ' Institutes ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' SNAP ', ' S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine ', ' American ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' saturated fat ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' Food Access ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinical effect ', ' community organizations ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' diabetes control ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' delivered meals ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' ']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2016,186942,0.30886206818434964
"Pathways from Food Insecurity to Health and Treatment Outcomes in Women with HIV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected women have higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared to men in the United States (U.S.). An important driver of health disparities and worse outcomes among HIV-infected women is food insecurity, or the inability to access food of sufficient quality or quantity in socially acceptable ways. Food insecurity affects 18 million households in the U.S. (40% of low income households), is more prevalent among women, and affects about half of urban poor HIV-infected individuals. Food insecurity is associated with worse immunologic and virologic outcomes in cross-sectional studies, increased HIV-related morbidity and mortality in longitudinal studies, and increased cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) in cross-sectional studies in the general population. Due to these negative health impacts among HIV-infected individuals, governmental and non-governmental organizations have argued to integrate food security and HIV/AIDS programming activities. A rigorous longitudinal study is urgently needed to quantify the impacts and identify the dominant mechanisms by which food insecurity negatively impacts health in order to improve the effectiveness and reach of food assistance programs and guide their integration with HIV/AIDS programs.  The proposed research assembles experts from medicine, infectious disease, immunology, biostatistics, and nutrition for a 4-year longitudinal study to quantify the impacts and identify the pathways linking food insecurity to HIV treatment and cardiovascular health in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). WIHS is an ongoing, prospective study in the U.S. of 1500 HIV-infected women and 650 non-infected, but at-risk, women. We plan to leverage the detailed HIV treatment and cardiovascular risk measures collected in WIHS to accomplish 3 aims. In aims 1 and 2, we hypothesize that food insecurity will be associated with worse HIV treatment and cardiovascular risk outcomes and that these relationships will be partially mediated by nutritional (food quality/quantity, obesity), mental health (depression, stress), and behavioral (treatment non-adherence, missed appointments) pathways. To accomplish aims 1 and 2, we will add measures of food insecurity, dietary quality, socio-economic status, competing demands between food and medical care, and antiretroviral (ARV) hair levels (a technique we pioneered as an objective measure of ARV adherence) to WIHS. Our analytic approach will be guided by a novel conceptual model that we recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. In aim 3, we hypothesize that food insecurity will be associated with markers of gut microbial translocation (MT), inflammation and immune activation among HIV-infected women, and that this association will be mediated by diet, obesity, and worse HIV control. To accomplish aim 3, we will add measures of gut MT and immune activation for a sub-sample of 250 women on ARV therapy. Our work will be critical to attract funding for this priority issue. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop sustainable solutions to tackle the intersecting challenges of food insecurity and HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality among women in the U.S. Food insecurity is common among poor women and HIV-infected persons, and has been associated with more illness, higher risk of heart disease, and quicker decline to AIDS and death. The proposed study brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts for a 4-year study among over 2000 women to answer two key unresolved questions, namely ""What is the magnitude of the impact of food security on health?"" and ""Which mechanisms drive this impact?"" This research will be critical to a) help increase funding for the integration of HIV and nutrition programs in the U.S. and elsewhere; b) select among the various programmatic options for improving food insecurity among HIV-infected women; and c) improve the reach and effectiveness of existing supplemental nutritional assistance programs.",Pathways from Food Insecurity to Health and Treatment Outcomes in Women with HIV,8978338,R01MH095683,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Appointment ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Color ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health Planning ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Household ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' elevated triglyceride ', ' elevated tg ', ' Triglycerides high ', ' Triglyceride increased ', ' Raised triglycerides ', ' Raised TG ', ' Hyperglyceridemia ', ' Hypertriglyceridemia ', ' Inflammation ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' alpha-Lipoproteins ', ' High density lipoprotein ', ' Heavy Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Lipoproteins ', ' HDL ', ' High Density Lipoproteins ', ' beta-Lipoproteins ', ' LDL Lipoproteins ', ' LDL ', ' Low-Density Lipoproteins ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"American Indian Diabetes Prevention Center:  Impacting Health Disparity in Youth PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions); This project collaboratively forges an alternative future for American Indian people relative to diabetes.  Several disciplines are joined from within the clinical health, social, behavioral, and cultural sciences as well as native advisors to comprise the intellectual engine of this proposed center. Knitting these diverse professional cultures into an effective interdisciplinary force will be done by iterative psychoeducational seminars. The Specific Aims are to reduce health disparities among American Indian (Al) people by 1) conducting medical and sociocultural research strengthening diabetes prevention and management in the context of contemporary Al culture, 2) developing interdisciplinary values and skills pervading all operations, 3) developing curricula fostering new skills and manpower in health disparities research, 4) collaborating with Al communities to produce diabetes education in culturally appropriate ways using new, easily accessed media, and 5) administering Center operations by Al's with Al perspectives that honor all people and things. The Administrative Core is composed of the PI, Project Coordinator, Administrative Director, and two staff assistants. This Core will manage all Center functions. The Research Core has three Research Sub- Projects: 1) discovering cultural categories of parental distress due to diabetes care of children with Type 1and 2 diabetes for use in behavioral medicine counseling, 2) testing efficacy of financial incentives for increasing physical activity in obese youth and change in cardiometabolic status, and 3) comparing the differential risk for preeclampsia among Caucasian, American Indian, and Hispanic women to explore hypothesized protective effects in indigenous people of the Western hemisphere. The Research Training/Education Core will 1) develop a new certificate program in nursing on health disparity reduction research, practice, and ethics, 2) develop the capacity to produce a series of 12-minute video stories (a highly valued approach to teaching among Al's) for dissemination and evaluation, and 3) conduct education on diabetes to Al adults with integrated encouragement to serve as health disparities research subjects. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core will 1) conduct a Youth Asset building program using community, family, and individual factors that assist youth in avoiding risky health behaviors, 2) evaluate the CDC Eagle Books in public schools with high Al enrollment, and 3) add a new community partner comprised of owners of rural, small food stores to begin promoting healthy foods, and 4) continue the Oklahoma City Area Intertribal Health Board partnership of all tribes in Oklahoma. Texas, and Kansas.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project will improve the public's health by reducing the unacceptably huge diabetes health disparity crisis among Al people through finding better means to: provide clinical care in its treatment, prevent onset, reduce familial distress in chronic disease coping, develop better healthy decision-making among youth, and develop better means to  communicate healthy lifestyle choices. The project also creates a collaboration with rural, small food outlets as ""Good Food Neighbors"" to promote selling healthier foods and introduces ""digital storytelling"" appropriate to Indian

"Diet and Health Behavior Change to Improve Bone Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sabrina Noel, PhD, RD is currently a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. She has advanced training in nutrition and epidemiology and experience working in both clinical and community settings. Dr. Noel's experience with diet and metabolic health research, and exposure to work with disparities in bone health, has encouraged her to pursue a career in population-based bone research. Her goal is to evaluate the effects of dietary quality on bone health and to develop a culturally and literacy-tailored behavior change intervention targeting dietary and physical activity behaviors among Caribbean Hispanic adults. In contrast to what has been earlier believed, Hispanics have recently been shown to have higher prevalence of osteoporosis, compared with non-Hispanic whites; however, most of this research has focused on Mexican Americans because of their majority status in the U.S. Hispanic population. Caribbean origin Hispanics are one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. population and are underrepresented in bone- related research. Preliminary data from a large study of Puerto Rican adults in Boston, MA, indicates that Caribbean Hispanics are at higher risk for osteoporosis than previously thought. Identifying modifiable health behaviors, such as diet and physical activity, to prevent bone loss is an important public health priority, as adherence to bone medications is generally poor. Increasing evidence suggests that overall dietary quality is critical for bone health; however, studies that use predefined dietary patterns as a measure of overall dietary quality have reported inconsistent associations with bone outcomes. This is likely due to the fact that nutrients and foods known to be important for bone are underrepresented in these existing indices. We, therefore, propose to develop a bone-specific dietary quality index with nationally based data, and to then adapt it to include ethnic (Caribbean Latino) specific food choices related to bone health. Few theory-based interventions have targeted both dietary and physical activity behaviors to promote bone health and none that we know of have focused on overall dietary quality or on Caribbean origin Hispanic adults. This K01 award will provide Dr. Noel with training and research experience in bone health and osteoporosis prevention, health behavior theory, behavioral intervention design, implementation and evaluation, and advanced biostatistics. This training will help Dr. Noel achieve her long-term career goals of becoming a leading independent investigator in nutrition and bone health with expertise in designing and conducting culturally tailored behavioral interventions to improve bone health in diverse populations. Dr. Noel's mentors are highly committed to her career development and future success and will help her build additional knowledge and skills in bone health and intervention research. Dr. Noel's proposed research aims are to: 1) develop a bone-specific dietary quality index that emphasizes specific foods and nutrients known to be important for bone; and to evaluate the effects of a resulting dietary quality score on bone health using national survey data; 2) to adapt the index to include ethnic-specific food choices of Caribbean origin Hispanics, using data from an existing study of Puerto Rican adults, to guide the dietary component of a lifestyle behavior change intervention and; 3) to adapt and pilot test the feasibility and preliminary impact of a theory-based cultural and literacy-tailored intervention to improve dietary and physical activity behaviors among 60 Caribbean origin Hispanic adults. This bone-focused intervention will be modeled after another unique behavioral intervention, which successfully improved dietary quality and other health behaviors in low-income Caribbean Latinos. Innovative strategies, including narrative forms of communication, will be employed to help individuals adopt healthy behaviors. This work will inform a larger scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the behavioral intervention on bone outcomes in Caribbean Hispanics. This has the potential to have significant public health implications for improving bone health and preventing osteoporosis in high-risk, underserved ethnic minority populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoporosis is an increasing health concern among U.S. Hispanic adults.

"The Impact of Healthy Food Marketing Strategies In Supermarkets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the prevalence of obesity has increased, public health experts have increasingly focused on the environments that shape overeating and unhealthy food choices. Retail grocery stores are pivotally positioned to influence choices and favorably affect energy balance. Greater availability of healthier foods, if translated to health-promoting purchases, can positively affect diet quality among those at greatest risk for obesity- low-income, ethnic minorities.  The aims of the proposed study are:  1. To evaluate, in a cluster randomized controlled trial design, effects of in-store healthy food  marketing strategies on sales and purchase of healthier items in six product categories  (milk, frozen entrees, beverage checkout coolers, bread, salty snacks and cheese); and  2. To evaluate the association of changes in supermarket food marketing environments with  changes in sales of specific healthier food items in the same six product categories; and  3. To examine the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and changes in sales and purchases of healthier items in the six product categories. We hypothesize that sales of targeted products will be significantly higher, and that more health- focused food marketing environments will be associated with higher sales of healthy food items.  The study will be conducted in 32 supermarkets in urban, low-income, high-minority neighbor- hoods in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Intervention strategies will include prime placement, increased visibility of healthier products, call-out signs, and taste-testing for milk. Control stores will be assessment-only. Supermarket chains will help implement the strategies and provide data on sales of targeted products. Interventions will be conducted for 2 years, with an emphasis on scalability and long-term sustainability. The primary outcome measures of purchasing will be weekly sales per store for each product. Individual purchasing will be assessed in a cohort of shoppers by interviews and shopping receipts. The Grocery Marketing Environment Assessment (GMEA) tool will be used to assess marketing environments.  The research team completed a randomized pilot study of a 6-month intervention in eight supermarkets, which demonstrated the impact of the interventions on three food categories. The proposed study will provide an expanded and extended, larger-scale, rigorous test of novel and widely applicable strategies to encourage healthy retail sales, complement increased- access initiatives, and reduce health disparities in obesity and related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using a cluster randomized controlled design, this study will evaluate effects of in-store healthy food marketing strategies on sales and purchase of specific healthier items in six product categories (milk, frozen entrees, beverage checkout coolers, salty snacks, bread and cheese); and examine the effects of changes in in-store food marketing environments on sales of healthier foods.

"Community-Based Dietary Approach for Hypertensive African Americans with Chronic Kidney Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) when compared to whites. Racial disparities are most profound among persons of low socioeconomic status (SES) and dietary factors likely underlie much of this disparity. Low SES AAs are more likely to experience food insecurity and live in ""food deserts"" and are less likely to follow a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordant diet than are whites. This is despite evidence that adherence to the DASH diet may have greater blood pressure benefit for AAs than whites, and evidence that the DASH diet may slow CKD progression (including reductions in urine albumin excretion). We propose to build upon encouraging results of our pilot study, ""The Five-Plus Nuts and Beans Trial"", which was conducted as a partnership between Johns Hopkins investigators, a community supermarket, the Baltimore City Health Department's ""Virtual Supermarket"" program, a community-based clinic and a highly engaged Community Advisory Board. This randomized trial tested the effects of a dietary approach to increase consumption of a central feature of the DASH diet--high potassium foods. A total of 123 AA patients with controlled hypertension, and recruited from a community-based clinic, were provided personalized dietary advice, assistance with grocery ordering and delivery, and $30 per week worth of high potassium foods for an 8-week period. With this approach, we demonstrated statistically significant increases in consumption of fruits, vegetables, potassium, magnesium and fiber, and decreases in sodium intake. Also, there was a 14% reduction in urinary albumin excretion overall, and a 30% reduction among patients with significant albuminuria at enrollment. In this application, we propose a larger (n=150) and longer (1 year) trial of a dietary intervention in AAs with hypertension (controlled or uncontrolled) plus mild/moderate CKD-a population at very high risk of the adverse effects of poor diets. The primary aim, in the setting of a randomized trial, is to test the hypothesis that delivery of nutritional advice to adopt the DASH diet and $30 per week worth of potassium-rich foods, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores of patients recruited from community-based clinics, will reduce blood pressure and reduce urinary albumin excretion in low SES AAs with hypertension and CKD. Strengths of our proposal include the integration of an experienced, highly collaborative team of investigators with expertise in clinical trials, nephrology, health disparities, community-based participatory research, integration of trials into primary care practices, and statistical analyses The investigation team includes a highly involved Community Advisory Board, and has an established close partnership with Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, the Baltimore City Health Department and local supermarkets. If our hypothesis is correct, then our trial will establish an immediately translatable, inexpensive, and safe approach for adjuvant therapy in the treatment of hypertension and kidney damage (albuminuria) among low SES AAs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are disproportionately affected by hypertension and kidney disease in the United States, and these disparities are particularly apparent among socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans. Limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy diets likely contribute to these disparities. In this community-based randomized clinical trial, we will test whether delivering nutritional advice to adopt the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and $30 per week worth of fruits and vegetables, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores, will reduce blood pressure and kidney damage in socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans with hypertension and chronic kidney disease.        ",Community-Based Dietary Approach for Hypertensive African Americans with Chronic Kidney Disease,9128134,U01MD010550,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Albumins ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Baltimore ', ' bean ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Weight Change ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Selections ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mg element ', ' Magnesium ', ' Milk ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nephrology ', ' Nuts ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' K element ', ' Potassium ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' excretion ', ' Excretory function ', ' Fiber ', ' Disease Progression ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Community Physician ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' Supermarket ', ' experience ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Intake ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' urinary ', ' early onset ', ' pilot trial ', ' hypertension treatment ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' high risk ', ' hypertension control ', ' intervention effect ', ' DASH diet ', ' Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' dietary approach ', ' blood pressure reduction ', ' reduction in blood pressure ', ' reduction in BP ', ' reduce blood pressure ', ' reduce BP ', ' lower blood pressure ', ' lower BP ', ' BP reduction ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' ']",NIMHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,479724,0.04410286389985114
"Proposed Meal Changes for CACFP: Impact on Child Food Intake and Costs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Revised Federal School Meal Guidelines: Impact on Student Food Intake and Costs CACFP meals are an important influence on diets of children from low-income families enrolled in the CACFP and should meet children's nutrient needs while fostering healthy eating habits that enable them to maintain energy balance. Recent national data revealed that children consumed low intakes of foods that support healthy dietary patterns (whole grains, fruit and vegetables other than potatoes), but high intakes of low nutrient, energy dense foods. The 2011 USDA-commissioned Institute of Medicine (IOM) report for CACFP meals provided new recommendations that include new meal pattern requirements for the meals programs, aligning them with the U.S. Dietary Guidelines to ensure that the meals promote health and reduce inadequate and excessive intakes. The report recommended inclusion of more whole grains, fruit, vegetables, and meat/meat alternatives which will likely increase meal costs. Two of the IOM report recommendations call for research to better understand how the new meal requirements would change children's CACFP meal dietary intakes and food service costs. These are important questions, and answers are needed to inform policy and future technical and educational assistance needs. The overall objective of this R01 grant application is to implement the IOM meal pattern requirements for CACFP meals in day homes and centers in Texas. Our multidisciplinary team will focus on nutrition, economics, and provider outcomes. The specific aims are to assess the impact of the new meal pattern requirements on 1) Meal participation rates; 2) Provider food service costs (food, labor, total meals); and 3) Child dietary intake at CACFP homes and centers. We hypothesize that, compared with control schools; intervention school students will select and consume healthier diets (more fruit, vegetables and whole grains) at school. We will collaborate with the Southwest Human Development Services, Inc. and recruit a total of 16 day care homes and 16 day care centers for the proposed study. We hypothesize that, compared with control sites; children at the intervention sites will select and consume healthier diets (more fruit, vegetable and whole grains) at the center. We also hypothesize that the increase in food costs will be less than that projected in the IOM report. The results on the costs associated with creating the desired meals will be very important as these data have not been systematically collected in previous studies. This significant study targets underserved minority populations with health promoting intervention to reduce health disparities, and in addition, will inform policy on the influence of  healthy food environment on children's diet, as well as provide critical information on costs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application will implement the new IOM meal pattern requirements for CACFP meals promoting whole grain, fruit, vegetables, and meat/meat alternatives in day care centers and homes. Outcomes from this study will identify what changes in children's dietary behaviors occur at CACFP mealtime as a result of the new meal patterns, identify the financial impact on the meal cost, and inform policy.",Proposed Meal Changes for CACFP: Impact on Child Food Intake and Costs,9136845,R01HL119520,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' pediatric nutrition ', ' Child Nutrition ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Treatment Day Care ', ' Partial Hospitalization ', ' Day Care ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Services ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Human Development ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Meat ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Potato ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Diet Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Ensure ', ' sugar ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' Outcome Study ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' energy balance ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Nutrient ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Day center care ', ' Trans Fats ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Intake ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Process ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' economic outcome ', ' food environment ', ' underserved minority ', ' racial minority ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' ']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2016,643418,0.2200014626846133
"Evaluation and Enhancement of the Summer Food Service Program in Youth from an Urban, Low-Resource Community PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal entitled, ‘Evaluation and enhancement of the Summer Food Service Program in youth from an urban, low-resource community’, is for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) for Dr. E. Whitney Evans, PhD, RD an Instructor (Research) at the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center (WCDRC) at The Miriam Hospital and Brown University Medical School. Dr. Evans received her PhD in nutritional epidemiology from the Tufts University Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, where she developed expertise in nutrition and the analytical skills to study the role of diet in relative weight in youth. Dr. Evans’ long-term career goal is to draw upon this background to design and conduct innovative obesity interventions specific to low-income youth. Thus, in response to evidence that low-income youth are at increased risk for excess summer weight gain, this application focuses on an existing federal nutrition assistance program – the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) – to determine how it can be enhanced to minimize income-related health disparities.  To help Dr. Evans successfully carry out this research and achieve her long-term career goal, this award will provide training in four key content areas: 1) qualitative research methods, 2) the design and conduct of behavioral obesity interventions, 3) advanced statistical methods to analyze data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 4) weight-related health disparities. This training will occur through formal didactics and hands-on research experience under the guidance of a highly qualified team of mentors. Dr. Evans will work closely with her primary mentor, Dr. Rena Wing, an internationally recognized obesity researcher, and four co- mentors: Dr. Sara Folta (qualitative research methods); Dr. Elissa Jelalian (behavioral obesity interventions for youth); Dr. Richard Jones (RCT statistical analysis); and Dr. Elsie Taveras (weight-related health disparities).  Through three complimentary studies, the proposed research project will thoroughly evaluate the SFSP. First, it will examine how dietary intake patterns (total energy intake and diet quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index, 2010), change in BMI z-score (as a proxy for change in total body adiposity), and SFSP participation over the summer relate to each other low-income schoolchildren, ages 6-12 years. Second, through focus groups with low-income families, it will identify motivators for and barriers to SFSP participation. Findings from these two formative studies along with the training Dr. Evans receives in behavioral obesity intervention development will be used to design an enhanced version of the SFSP. The enhanced SFSP will target relevant obesity risk factors identified in study 1 as well as SFSP participation barriers identified in study 2 to improve SFSP engagement. The feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of this enhanced version of the SFSP will then be compared to the standard SFSP in an RCT on the basis of participation, diet and excess summer weight gain. This research will form the basis for a larger efficacy trial of the intervention to be proposed in an R01 application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed K01 application is designed to assist Dr. Evans in establishing an independent research career in the field of childhood obesity by providing training, experience and mentorship in the areas of: (1) qualitative research, (2) innovative behavioral obesity interventions; (3) advanced statistical skills to analyze data from randomized controlled trials; and (4) weight-related health disparities. As obesity prevalence continues to rise among low-income youth, there is a need for novel interventions that specifically help them manage income- related barriers and prevent excess weight gain. Through three complimentary studies with children from a low-resource, urban community, the proposed research project will clarify how participation in the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), dietary intake patterns and excess summer weight gain relate to each other, identify salient barriers to SFSP participation, and test whether an enhanced version of the SFSP is more acceptable and effective at preventing excess weight gain than the standard program.","Evaluation and Enhancement of the Summer Food Service Program in Youth from an Urban, Low-Resource Community",9162739,K01DK110142,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Services ', ' Foundations ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Lipids ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Nutrition Policy ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' instructor ', ' experience ', ' energy balance ', ' intervention program ', ' Proxy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' nutritional epidemiology ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Qualifying ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' obesity prevention ', ' cost ', ' national surveillance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' obesity risk ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' surveillance data ', ' healthy weight ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition science ', ' summer program ', ' summer session ', ' urban children ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' ']",NIDDK,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,K01,2016,141951,0.08841343958824498
"Appalachians Together Restoring the Eating Environment (Appal-TREE): Advancing Sustainable CBPR Interventions to Improve Healthy Diet in Rural Appalachian Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The National Institutes of Health has acknowledged that residents of rural Appalachia experience among the nation's worst health and economic profiles, including disability and premature mortality stemming from elevated rates of heart disease and stroke, various cancers, diabetes, all of which are closely associated with suboptimal dietary intake, obesity, and overweight. Community members are particularly concerned about their children, who have among the highest rates of obesity, overweight, and suboptimal dietary intake in the nation. Eliminating these health disparities requires scientificaly informed community-engaged research to develop and evaluate innovative and sustainable programs and policies. For the proposed application, our community-research team will (1) use an innovative information technology CBPR method - Structured Public Involvement - to refine and tailor a package of pilot tested healthy eating interventions; (2) conduct and evaluate this package of interventions that were found to be feasible, culturally consonant, and promising during R24MD008018 and (3) build community capacity in social marketing, an innovative approach to enhance sustainability of the intervention. Our partners include the Community Farm Alliance, local school districts, the Cooperative Extension Service, and other community organizations. For the first aim, the innovative CBPR approach Structured Public Involvement will allow us to tailor the intervention while maintaining project fidelity. For the second aim, we will administer and evaluate three interrelated interventions to transform access to and intake of healthy foods for Appalachian children; (1) a school-based water campaign to decrease sugar sweetened beverage consumption (2) healthy cooking classes to encourage healthy cooking on a budget; and (3).a farmer's market-based healthy summer feeding program. Finally, in Aim 3, we will administer a CBPR-oriented approach, social marketing, to enhance sustainability, a challenge for all behavioral interventions. Through the schools, we will train teachers and administrators to teach social marketing to students, who will be encouraged to develop marketing campaigns supporting healthy diets. All of these efforts will be developed, implemented, and evaluated in conjunction with our Community Advisory Boards. As one of our local stakeholders told us, ""If you really are what you eat, it's no wonder so many of us are unhealthy."" By developing sustainable, evidence-based programming, we aim to transform consumption patterns and the eating environment so the next generation of rural residents can overcome pernicious health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Appalachians Together Restoring the Eating Environment (Appal-TREE) uses a new CBPR technology to solicit community input, delivers a tested package of healthy diet interventions (water promotion, cooking classes, and expansion of the Summer Food Service Program via farmers markets) to Appalachian communities.

"Evaluating a Food Hub Opening in an Urban Context ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food hubs are an emerging and increasingly popular approach to reduce obesity trends by improving diet through increased access to nutritious foods. Food hubs offer a wide variety of healthy foods for purchase by both consumers and other food retailers (e.g., corner stores), and typically operate on a value-based business model that prioritizes both economic development and community benefit. Food hubs may be particularly impactful in ""food desert"" communities that have limited or no access to traditional food retailers, are low income, and have high rates of obesity. However, there is currently no evidence of the influence of a food hub on dietary behaviors related to preventing and reducing obesity. This study will provide programmatic and policy-relevant evidence to close this gap by taking advantage of a time-sensitive opportunity to evaluate a newly forming food hub that will be established through two independent grants awarded to the community (not the research team) in late 2014. The new food hub will open in October 2015, and this rapid response study will provide a chance to collect baseline data prior to opening. The central hypothesis guiding this research is that the food hub will improve both physical and social access to nutritious foods, which will improve diet quality, fruit and vegetable consumption, and caloric intake among people living near the new food hub. Using a quasi-experimental design with repeated measures, changes in diet will be compared between primary food shoppers living in the intervention community receiving the new food hub to those in a matched control community. Dietary changes will be measured at three time points (baseline and 12 and 24 months post food hub) using the Nutrition Data System for Research, the gold standard for assessing 24-hour dietary recalls to examine individual-level changes. At each time point, three dietary recalls will be collected to provide more accurate estimates. The study will examine changes in the three diet outcomes (e.g., diet quality, FV consumption, caloric intake) between residents in the two communities, will assess the extent that psychosocial factors explain these changes, and, among residents in the intervention community, will examine the dose-response relationship between food hub use and changes in diet using objective measures of food hub shopping. Additionally, this research will contribute to the science of food environment interventions to prevent or reduce obesity by assessing the impact of the new food hub on the broader food retail environment. Finally, the study will contribute to the science and practice of implementing food hub interventions by examining how the specific intervention components (such as healthy food incentives, healthy food community organizers, cooking clubs, etc.) are implemented and received by the community as well as intended and unintended consequences. Findings will provide evidence about the extent to which food hub interventions contribute to changes in diet among people living in low-income, urban communities, and will offer guidance for reducing obesity trends and inequities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This study will evaluate the effect of a new food hub opening in a low-income, urban community that is currently defined as a food desert. The study will evaluate the impact of the food hub on changes in diet among people living near the food hub. Results will provide critical and timely guidance to inform public health policy and programs to achieve the Healthy People 2020 goal to reduce obesity trends and inequities.",Evaluating a Food Hub Opening in an Urban Context,9096786,R01DK108184,"['Adoption ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Economical Development ', ' Economic Development ', ' Environment ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incentives ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Ohio ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vendor ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' cooking ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' psychosocial ', ' Supermarket ', ' sq. ft ', ' square foot ', ' Prevention Research ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' trend ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' community intervention ', ' consumer demand ', ' systems research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' intervention effect ', ' public health research ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' food environment ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' ']",NIDDK,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,670008,0.33854425458696996
"Impact of Racially Targeted Food and Beverage Ads on Adolescent Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and diabetes pose significant and costly threats to public health in the United States. Food and beverage marketing has been identified as a major driver of obesity and diabetes, with the majority of advertisements promoting sugary beverages and energy-dense, nutrient-poor food products. Studies show children exposed to food advertisements are more likely to request the advertised food, express preference for the advertised food, and consume more food. Adolescents also represent a key target for marketers because of their buying power and influence over parent purchases. African American and Hispanic adolescents are especially highly targeted consumers because they are perceived by marketers to be ""cultural trendsetters."" Adolescents are exposed to food and beverage advertisements through traditional forms of media, and increasingly, through digital media and social networking websites. To assess how exposure to racially-targeted food and beverage advertisements affects adolescents' food choices and perceptions of products, this study will examine adolescents' ratings of advertisements and featured products, and how exposure to advertisements affects dietary choices. Data collection will occur online through Survey Sampling International's database of participants (Aim 1 and 2, outcomes are ratings of advertisements and willingness to engage in marketing promotions) and through community organizations that serve adolescents (Aim 3, outcomes are advertising ratings and actual food choices). Subjects will be male and female adolescents ages 12-17 years who identify as African American, Hispanic, or White, and a subset of the participants will speak Spanish and English. These data will capture how racially-targeted advertisements affect adolescents' food and beverage choices and perceptions of food and beverage products. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is one of the most complex and costly public health problems in the United States, and food marketing has been identified as a significant driver of obesity.

"Understanding the risk of obesity in food-insecure children: the hidden role of stress ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food insecurity, a household condition of limited food availability, affects 16 million US children today. Food- insecure children are at risk for adverse diet-related health conditions; however, the mechanisms underlying these associations have not been clearly identified. Chronic, psychological stress may represent an important pathway between food insecurity and childhood obesity. The effects of chronic stress on children's cognitive development and cardio-metabolic health have been well-documented. However, research of the psychological component of food insecurity is sparse. Understanding the psychosocial and cognitive mechanisms underlying children's experiences of food insecurity is important to inform the development of strategies to reduce children's food insecurity and its sequelae. I am pursuing a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award to fill critical training gaps in the areas of stress mechanisms and measurement, children's development of cognitive processes related to overeating, and causal mediation analysis. This award will build upon my advanced training as a nutrition epidemiologist and my prior research on the relations between participation in the federal food programs and diet-related chronic disease. The detailed training plan includes formal coursework at UCSF and UC Berkeley, meetings, seminars, readings, and research apprenticeships. The research component of my project will provide opportunities to integrate knowledge from these new areas. Through the proposed series of studies, I will test the hypothesis that household food insecurity increases children's psychological stress, which shapes their cognitive processes related to eating behaviors and food choice, and predicts subsequent weight gain. First, I will develop a measure to capture children's psychological stress of food insecurity, drawing from qualitative interviews with food-insecure children and existing measures of children's psychological stress. The measure's psychometric properties will be empirically tested in a separate sample of low-income children. Second, in a laboratory setting, I will determine the extent to which children's food insecurity-stress mediates the relationship between household food insecurity and children's cognitive processes related to overeating, using the newly developed measure. Finally, I will design and conduct a two- year longitudinal study to examine associations between household food insecurity and children's weight gain, and the extent to which this is mediated through the proposed pathway. This program of research will focus on children during the transition to adolescence (ages 8-12), a significant period for cognitive development and weight gain with lifelong implications. These findings will highlight a novel and important pathway to explain the adverse effects of food insecurity on children's developmental and diet-related outcomes. The proposed training plan and series of studies will provide me with a set of skills and expertise needed to successfully compete for funding as an independent investigator and to serve as a leader in developing interventions and policies to minimize food insecurity and promote health in low-income children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Food insecurity has been linked with adverse diet-related health outcomes in children; however, the mechanisms underlying these associations are not well-understood. This project will test the hypothesis that household food insecurity promotes children's psychological stress, which shapes their cognitive processes related to eating behaviors and food choice, predicting subsequent weight gain.

"Dietary Quality, Cognitive Decline and Brain Health in Puerto Rican Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this proposal is that consumption of highly processed foods contributes to cognitive decline with aging. These dietary effects may lead to health disparities in cognitive decline due to the known greater consumption of highly processed foods in low-income populations. While many factors are associated with the effects of a diet characterized by highly processed foods, including displacement of healthy foods and the myriad of nutrients associated with these, we propose that two nutrients, in particular, may have effects through known or emerging pathways that affect brain function. First, there is evidence that highly processed foods contribute to greater intake of phosphorus (P) through P-based food additives which can increase food P content by ≥70%. Vascular risk factors predict cognitive decline and excess P may elevate CVD risk. However, the role of P in cognitive decline remains unclear. One novel pathway is compensatory elevation in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a predictor of vascular calcification and CVD. Klotho, a putative anti-aging factor, may be protective against CVD and cognitive decline. Among mice, a high P diet reduced klotho secretion. Excessive P consumption may lower klotho and impair cognitive function through modulation of FGF23, but human data remain sparse. P also elevates parathyroid hormone (PTH), which predicts CVD mortality and presence of cerebral infarcts. Second, vitamin B6 (B6), a critical cofactor for ≥100 metabolic reactions, is easily lost with food processing and unlike other B vitamins is not added back to enriched grains. We have shown that low B6 status was associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and depressive symptoms in Puerto Rican adults. Earlier work with non-Hispanic white men, showed associations of both diet and plasma B6 (pyridoxl-5'-phosphate,PLP) with 3 y cognitive decline. Latinos appear to be disproportionately burdened by cognitive impairment compared to non-Hispanic whites. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that Puerto Ricans have >twice the odds of low global cognitive function compared to Mexicans. With the growing and aging Latino population in the U.S likely to contribute to major increases in the burden of cognitive decline, it is critical that we improve our understanding of preventive risk factors that may inform interventions. We will use data from the Boston Puerto Rican Health study (BPRHS), a longitudinal cohort study of U.S. mainland Puerto Ricans (45-74 y) with diet, nutritional biomarkers, and cognitive function testing data available at baseline and 2 and 5 y follow-up. We will recruit BPRHS participants to return (~ 8-y from baseline) for a repeat battery of cognitive exams and, for a subset, an MRI scan. We will quantify the associations between processed foods consumption, P status (serum P, FGF23, klotho, and PTH), dietary B6, and PLP, as exposures, with ~8 y cognitive decline (psychometric testing) and brain structure, cerebral infarcts, white matter integrity, and connectivity (MRI) at ~8 y, as outcomes. Further the potential mediative roles of inflammation (CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) will be measured. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive decline is an increasing health concern among U.S. Latino adults, particularly those of Puerto Rican heritage. The proposed project aims to quantify the importance of highly processed foods consumption and phosphorus and vitamin B6 status in relation to cognitive decline (psychometric testing) and brain health (MRI) among older U.S. mainland Puerto Rican adults. With the growing and aging Latino population in the U.S likely to contribute to major increases in the burden of cognitive decline, these data will provide critical information to improve our understanding of preventive risk factors that may inform interventions.","Dietary Quality, Cognitive Decline and Brain Health in Puerto Rican Adults",9447763,R01AG055948,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human

"The Impact of Healthy Food Marketing Strategies In Supermarkets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the prevalence of obesity has increased, public health experts have increasingly focused on the environments that shape overeating and unhealthy food choices. Retail grocery stores are pivotally positioned to influence choices and favorably affect energy balance. Greater availability of healthier foods, if translated to health-promoting purchases, can positively affect diet quality among those at greatest risk for obesity- low-income, ethnic minorities.  The aims of the proposed study are:  1. To evaluate, in a cluster randomized controlled trial design, effects of in-store healthy food  marketing strategies on sales and purchase of healthier items in six product categories  (milk, frozen entrees, beverage checkout coolers, bread, salty snacks and cheese); and  2. To evaluate the association of changes in supermarket food marketing environments with  changes in sales of specific healthier food items in the same six product categories; and  3. To examine the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and changes in sales and purchases of healthier items in the six product categories. We hypothesize that sales of targeted products will be significantly higher, and that more health- focused food marketing environments will be associated with higher sales of healthy food items.  The study will be conducted in 32 supermarkets in urban, low-income, high-minority neighbor- hoods in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Intervention strategies will include prime placement, increased visibility of healthier products, call-out signs, and taste-testing for milk. Control stores will be assessment-only. Supermarket chains will help implement the strategies and provide data on sales of targeted products. Interventions will be conducted for 2 years, with an emphasis on scalability and long-term sustainability. The primary outcome measures of purchasing will be weekly sales per store for each product. Individual purchasing will be assessed in a cohort of shoppers by interviews and shopping receipts. The Grocery Marketing Environment Assessment (GMEA) tool will be used to assess marketing environments.  The research team completed a randomized pilot study of a 6-month intervention in eight supermarkets, which demonstrated the impact of the interventions on three food categories. The proposed study will provide an expanded and extended, larger-scale, rigorous test of novel and widely applicable strategies to encourage healthy retail sales, complement increased- access initiatives, and reduce health disparities in obesity and related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using a cluster randomized controlled design, this study will evaluate effects of in-store healthy food marketing strategies on sales and purchase of specific healthier items in six product categories (milk, frozen entrees, beverage checkout coolers, salty snacks, bread and cheese); and examine the effects of changes in in-store food marketing environments on sales of healthier foods.

"Race and the transformation of the food environment:  Fast food, African Americans, and the color line, 1955-1995 African Americans suffer from a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality from a wide spectrum of conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer, and these disparities are not attributable solely to individual socioeconomic status or access to health care. Research has shown that social determinants are key factors in African American health and health disparities. Evidence is mounting for the health impact of neighborhood context, particularly with regard to the food environment. Several studies have documented that African American communities are disproportionately exposed to fast food, and other studies have shown that exposure to fast food is associated with greater risk of obesity and other chronic disease. What have been little studied are the complex historical drivers of racially patterned exposure to fast food. Research is needed to interrogate the forces that moved fast food from its historical origins of middle-class White suburban and rural communities to the predominantly Black central city. The proposed study seeks to advance research on social determinants of health by conducting historical analyses of the racial transformation of fast food in the U.S. from 1955 to 1995, focusing on large cities with large Black populations in the Midwest and Northeast. Drawing on archival resources from a number of collections, I will produce a book that will be of interest to scholars in public health, the social sciences and the humanities. In so doing, the proposed work will make an innovative contribution to understanding what puts African Americans at risk of health risks. Project Narrative This project focuses on the history of fast food in urban African American neighborhoods in the U.S. The project will study when and how fast food shifted its target consumers, moving from the predominantly White middle class suburbs where fast food chains became popular, to predominantly Black central city communities, where they are most dense today. The project has strong relevance for public health because it investigates the forces that have shaped the food environment in African American communities, which is important to understanding the context of chronic disease.","Race and the transformation of the food environment:  Fast food, African Americans, and the color line, 1955-1995",9229996,G13LM012463,"['accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' suburban communities ', ' Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Advertising ', ' Archives ', ' Attention ', ' Books ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Central City ', ' Chicago ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Darkness ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Economics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Humanities ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Ownership ', ' Periodicals ', ' Politics ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Privatization ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Scholarship ', ' Social Sciences ', ' State Government ', ' Provincial Government ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' Rural Community ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' TimeLine ', ' base ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Food Industry ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Food Chain ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' consumer demand ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' obesity risk ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' public health relevance ', ' social health determinants ', ' food environment ', ' health data ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' ']",NLM,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",G13,2017,50000,0.2616019937729221
"A Systems Science Approach to Understanding Racial/Ethnic Dispartities in Obesity ABSTRACT Identifying effective strategies for reducing obesity is critical for alleviating the unequal burden of obesity and related adverse cardiopulmonary and sleep outcomes facing black and Hispanic women in the U.S. Studies typically focus on identifying independent effects of individual and environmental factors on obesity, but this approach overlooks important inter-relationships between these factors. This is challenging to model using traditional regression modeling approaches which are not well equipped to handle the complex ways individuals interact with their environments. Systems science approaches were promoted in two recent reports released by the Institute of Medicine and are part of the NHLBI Strategic Research Priorities because predictive and simulation-based models can both elucidate the complex inter-relationships between social, economic, and environmental causes of poor health and assess the benefits and harms of policy and intervention options. Thus, the overall goal of this application is to use a systems science methodology, agent- based modeling, to understand how individual-level behaviors and psychosocial factors interact with characteristics of the food environment to influence eating behaviors and obesity. This goal will be accomplished by executing the following aims: 1) to examine associations of food store characteristics with body mass index among Hispanic, black and white women; 2) to develop an exploratory agent-based model that simulates the emergence of racial/ethnic disparities in obesity among women; and 3) to investigate the effectiveness of potential multi-level interventions to reduce obesity. The candidate, Kiarri Kershaw, is an Assistant Professor of Preventive Medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Her strong training in general epidemiology, social epidemiology, and population health has allowed her to pursue a research agenda focused on racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and place-based disparities in cardiovascular disease risk factors. The K01 award will allow her to build on her current training by providing her with protected time to collect data on factors that influence lifestyle choices and to build and test an initial agent- based simulation. It will also allow her to learn how to work with community stakeholders and policymakers in order to develop research studies with a greater potential to translate into public health improvements. This training will help Dr. Kershaw achieve her long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program that focuses on how inter-relationships between individuals and their environments influence disparities in CVD risk. RELEVANCE: The results of this research project and future studies will allow for the development of effective, comprehensive multi-level interventions to promote cardiovascular health by reducing racial/ethnic disparities in obesity. Specifically, the execution of these aims will lead to an improved understanding of the dynamic inter-relationships between individuals and their environments that contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in eating behaviors and obesity.",A Systems Science Approach to Understanding Racial/Ethnic Dispartities in Obesity,9330925,K01HL133531,"['Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Local Government ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' tool ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' cardio-pulmonary ', ' Physical environment ', ' professor ', ' Nutrient ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' systematic review ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population health ', ' food environment ', ' public health intervention ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Data Analytics ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2017,133507,0.04161319743019387
"Impact of a Local Staple Food Ordinance on Food Choice and Calories Purchased DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this R01 is to evaluate the impact of a local policy change (i.e., the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance) that establishes minimum stocking criteria for a wide array of healthy foods as a requirement of food store licensing. Recent calls to action from the Institute of Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other authorities have identified improving access to healthy foods as a primary strategy for local governments to use in advancing obesity prevention efforts, but policy initiatives in this area have been limited. In this R01, the impact of the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance will be evaluated by assessing objectively measured changes in: (a) food environments among small, urban food stores, including availability, promotion, advertising, quality, price, and placement of both healthy and unhealthy foods and beverages, (b) nutritional quality of consumer purchases at small food stores, including assessment of energy density and calories via customer intercept surveys and direct observation of purchases and (c) home food environments, including availability of healthy and unhealthy foods/beverages and an overall home food obesogenicity score, among households that frequently shop at small stores. These changes will be assessed pre-policy implementation, as well as 4-, 12- and 24-months post-policy implementation, in two Minnesota cities: Minneapolis and St. Paul, (our control community). The proposed scope of work in this R01 is important because its takes advantage of a unique opportunity to evaluate an innovative local policy addressing a recommended action area for obesity prevention that aligns with key recommendations by leading obesity prevention authorities. To our knowledge, the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance is the only policy of its kind in the US, and as such it could serve as an important model policy for other local governments if it is successful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving healthy food availability and decreasing the availability of high calorie, low nutrient products, particularly in underserved communities, has been identified as a leading strategy for local governments to prevent obesity. However, policy action in this area to date has been limited. This R01 will examine the impact of a local policy change that establishes minimum stocking criteria for a wide array of healthy foods as a requirement of food store licensing. To our knowledge, this is the only policy of its kind in the US.

"Understanding & Overcoming Food Insecurity in Diabetes Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food insecurity, defined as difficulty affording an adequate diet owing to cost, affects over 20% of the 29 million Americans with diabetes. Food insecurity is an important socioeconomic barrier to effective diabetes care: it is associated with worse diabetes control and increased emergency department visits and hospitalization. By incentivizing consumption of calorie-dense foods high in simple carbohydrates and saturated fats, instead of more expensive fresh produce and whole grains, food insecurity may undermine healthy diets that are crucial for diabetes management. This project will help advance our knowledge of the relationship between food insecurity and diabetes by identifying how food insecurity affects current diabetes management and examining the clinical effects of using different strategies to overcome it. Fundamental questions regarding the mechanisms underlying potential interventions remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To determine the impact of food insecurity on a lifestyle change intervention: the REAL HEALTH Diabetes trial (R18 DK102737 NCT02320253), a pragmatic adaptation of the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention to community health centers, 2)To estimate the effect of nutrition assistance program use on diabetes control for patients in a primary care network, and 3) To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility of home-delivered medically tailored meals for food insecure diabetes patients with hyperglycemia. This research program complements the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' strategic focus on translating clinical research to practice by overcoming barriers faced by patients in real-world settings, reducing disparities in special populations, making care more patient-centered, and innovating within systems of care. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in understanding how socioeconomic barriers affect diabetes management and pragmatic interventions to overcome them. Career development activities include training in advanced analytic methods and intervention design through formal coursework as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will fill important knowledge gaps, and help improve diabetes management and reduce diabetes complications in patients with food insecurity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Over 29 million Americans have diabetes, and 1 in 5, nearly 6 million, report food insecurity, or difficulty accessing nutritious food owing to cost. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of the role food insecurity plays in diabetes management, and assess 2 strategies to address food insecurity in diabetes patients: 1) improving food access using nutritional assistance programs, and 2) directly providing medically tailored meals. This program has the potential to expand partnerships between healthcare systems and community organizations, and may reduce the impact of food insecurity among vulnerable diabetes patients",Understanding & Overcoming Food Insecurity in Diabetes Patients,9322430,K23DK109200,"['Affect ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' Incentives ', ' indexing ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Program Development ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' nutritional supplement ', ' diet supplement ', ' dietary supplements ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Calories ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' good diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine ', ' SNAP ', ' American ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Improve Access ', ' International ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' Food Access ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical effect ', ' community organizations ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' diabetes control ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' delivered meals ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' ']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2017,96932,0.30886206818434964
"Evaluation and Enhancement of the Summer Food Service Program in Youth from an Urban, Low-Resource Community PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal entitled, ‘Evaluation and enhancement of the Summer Food Service Program in youth from an urban, low-resource community’, is for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) for Dr. E. Whitney Evans, PhD, RD an Instructor (Research) at the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center (WCDRC) at The Miriam Hospital and Brown University Medical School. Dr. Evans received her PhD in nutritional epidemiology from the Tufts University Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, where she developed expertise in nutrition and the analytical skills to study the role of diet in relative weight in youth. Dr. Evans’ long-term career goal is to draw upon this background to design and conduct innovative obesity interventions specific to low-income youth. Thus, in response to evidence that low-income youth are at increased risk for excess summer weight gain, this application focuses on an existing federal nutrition assistance program – the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) – to determine how it can be enhanced to minimize income-related health disparities.  To help Dr. Evans successfully carry out this research and achieve her long-term career goal, this award will provide training in four key content areas: 1) qualitative research methods, 2) the design and conduct of behavioral obesity interventions, 3) advanced statistical methods to analyze data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 4) weight-related health disparities. This training will occur through formal didactics and hands-on research experience under the guidance of a highly qualified team of mentors. Dr. Evans will work closely with her primary mentor, Dr. Rena Wing, an internationally recognized obesity researcher, and four co- mentors: Dr. Sara Folta (qualitative research methods); Dr. Elissa Jelalian (behavioral obesity interventions for youth); Dr. Richard Jones (RCT statistical analysis); and Dr. Elsie Taveras (weight-related health disparities).  Through three complimentary studies, the proposed research project will thoroughly evaluate the SFSP. First, it will examine how dietary intake patterns (total energy intake and diet quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index, 2010), change in BMI z-score (as a proxy for change in total body adiposity), and SFSP participation over the summer relate to each other low-income schoolchildren, ages 6-12 years. Second, through focus groups with low-income families, it will identify motivators for and barriers to SFSP participation. Findings from these two formative studies along with the training Dr. Evans receives in behavioral obesity intervention development will be used to design an enhanced version of the SFSP. The enhanced SFSP will target relevant obesity risk factors identified in study 1 as well as SFSP participation barriers identified in study 2 to improve SFSP engagement. The feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of this enhanced version of the SFSP will then be compared to the standard SFSP in an RCT on the basis of participation, diet and excess summer weight gain. This research will form the basis for a larger efficacy trial of the intervention to be proposed in an R01 application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed K01 application is designed to assist Dr. Evans in establishing an independent research career in the field of childhood obesity by providing training, experience and mentorship in the areas of: (1) qualitative research, (2) innovative behavioral obesity interventions; (3) advanced statistical skills to analyze data from randomized controlled trials; and (4) weight-related health disparities. As obesity prevalence continues to rise among low-income youth, there is a need for novel interventions that specifically help them manage income- related barriers and prevent excess weight gain. Through three complimentary studies with children from a low-resource, urban community, the proposed research project will clarify how participation in the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), dietary intake patterns and excess summer weight gain relate to each other, identify salient barriers to SFSP participation, and test whether an enhanced version of the SFSP is more acceptable and effective at preventing excess weight gain than the standard program.","Evaluation and Enhancement of the Summer Food Service Program in Youth from an Urban, Low-Resource Community",9321487,K01DK110142,"['Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Nutrition Policy ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' instructor ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Dietary intake ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' nutritional epidemiology ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' International ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' obesity prevention ', ' cost ', ' national surveillance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' obesity risk ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' surveillance data ', ' healthy weight ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition science ', ' summer program ', ' summer session ', ' hands on research ', ' urban children ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' lower income families ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Services ', ' Foundations ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Lipids ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' ']",NIDDK,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,K01,2017,140726,0.08841343958824498
"SES and race-ethnic disparities in food purchasing and dietary intake:2000-2015 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SES and race-ethnic disparities of food purchasing and dietary intake: 2000-2015 Our primary goals are to use in-depth descriptive and longitudinal analyses of shift in food purchases among critical race/ethnic and SES subpopulations to examine the impact of the Great Recession (beginning in 2007), and other SES factors on short-term and long-term food purchase and dietary outcomes. In addition, we will seek to understand factors determining how our key subpopulations select the consumer packaged goods sector (CPGs) foods and beverages they purchase and how this affects their nutrient intake. Food purchase and dietary outcomes include nutritional quality (calories, sodium, saturated fat and added sugars), and patterns (focusing on selected subgroups of foods considered to contain large proportions of empty calories, and away-from-home intakes). Using data purchased under separate funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), the UNC Food Research Program (UNCFRP) has created a longitudinal file of Nielsen Homescan household purchase data from 2000-2012, and we propose to expand this work to later years and additional analyses under this grant. We examine a number of key issues related to the diets of key minority (Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites) and lower income subpopulations. We will use longitudinal commercial data on CPG food and beverage purchases by a nationally representative sample of 35,000 to 60,000 households in each quarter linked with nutrition facts panel data at the barcode level. With a unique crosswalk, we link these commercial data to the publicly available What We Eat in America (WWEIA) dietary intake interview component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) and the US Department of Agriculture nutrient databases. We will implement established linear programming methods to estimate added sugar content of all commercial CPG products (706,451 items in 2000-10 alone). We use longitudinal methods, correct for endogeneity in selection of various types of stores (convenience, grocery, mass merchandisers/supercenters, and warehouse/club stores), account for dynamics in market shares of branded vs. private label products, and examine other issues relevant to dynamics of food purchase and diet among race-ethnic, age and income subpopulations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to evaluate how an array of economic changes, including the Great Recession, may have differentially affected the nutrient composition of consumer package foods and beverages purchases from various categories of food stores, branded vs. private label brands by critical subpopulations. In addition, we will link these changes to individual dietary intake changes in national dietary intake to understand what these changes mean for trends and patterns in access to and intake of key foods and nutrients. The entire focus is on explaining differences within and between major race-ethnic-income-age subpopulations.",SES and race-ethnic disparities in food purchasing and dietary intake:2000-2015,9328072,R01DK098072,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Americas ', ' Behavior ', ' Beverages ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' nutrition ', ' Privatization ', ' Product Labeling ', ' Linear Programming ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vendor ', ' Wood ', ' Wood material ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Label ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Calories ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' Nutrient ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' food surveillance ', ' food supply surveillance ', ' food supply monitoring ', ' food monitoring ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Macronutrients ', ' Macronutrients Nutrition ', ' Update ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' trend ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' public health relevance ', ' health inequalities ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,701668,0.283185842301144
"Understanding the role of gender inequality and food insecurity on maternal and child health Project Summary/Abstract Career Goals: This is a resubmission of an application for a K01 Career Development Award in Population Research for Nadia Diamond-Smith, PhD, MSc, an Assistant Professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Her preliminary research focuses on maternal and child health in South Asia, specifically the role of gender inequality and food insecurity. In the short term, she aims to build on this work, investigating the effect of gender inequality and food insecurity on maternal and child health outcomes in newly married women in Nepal. In the long term, she aspires to conduct research that results in interventions that will improve gender inequality and food access, and ultimately improve maternal and child health outcomes for women across their life course, with a focus on the pre-conception period. The knowledge and experience she will gain from this K01 award will prepare her to compete for NICHD R01 funding to test the household level behavior change and food insecurity intervention to address household dynamics around women's empowerment and access to food and nutrition in Nepal developed in this proposal in a randomized intervention trial. Environment: The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) provides generous support for junior faculty. UCSF researchers have a long history of pursuing innovative ideas in reproductive health, studying food insecurity, and working in low and middle-income countries. Key Elements of Research Career Development Plan: Dr. Diamond-Smith has a strong background in public health (epidemiology and biostatistics) and demographic methods, with substantial experience analyzing large datasets and conducting qualitative data. This career development award will enable her to address several remaining gaps in her training specific to her career goals, and to gain applied experience planning and executing a primary data collection study on gender inequality and food insecurity, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. She seeks training in (1) maternal and child nutrition and food insecurity; (2) women's empowerment theory and measurement; and (3) implementation sciences, including designing behavioral interventions and evaluating interventions. To achieve these goals, Dr. Diamond-Smith has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team. It includes her Primary Mentor, Sheri Weiser, MD, MPH, in the School of Medicine at UCSF with a secondary appointment in Global Health Sciences at UCSF, who has extensive experience conducting research and developing interventions on food insecurity and health outcomes, and co-mentor Mallory Johnson, PhD, a Clinical Health Psychologist in UCSF's School of Medicine and an expert behavior change interventions and intervention design and evaluation. Her team includes three additional, complementary advisors: Cynthia Harper, PhD, in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at UCSF, with an expertise in demography and women's reproductive health and experience working in Nepal; Anita Raj, PhD, in the Division of Global Public Health, Department of Medicine, at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), with training in Developmental Psychology and extensive experience in South Asia on topics including sexual and reproductive health, maternal and child health, and gender based violence; and George W. Rutherford, MD, Vice Chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the School of Medicine at UCSF, with expertise in pediatric epidemiology and interventions to improve child health. Dr. Diamond-Smith's training will include a combination of structured reading lists and tutorials with mentors, coursework, workshops, conference presentations and attendance, and seminars. Description of the Research Project: Women and children in Nepal are especially vulnerable to malnutrition, which I hypothesize is due to pervasive gender inequality across women's life course combined with food insecurity at the individual and household level. I hypothesize that household dynamics around women's empowerment and access to food are especially crucial in the pre-conception period. The overall objective of this study is to examine the pathways between gender inequality, food insecurity, and maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) in newly married households in Nepal and to adapt an existing intervention to this population. My main hypothesis is that gender inequality and food insecurity intersect to compromise pre- conception health, which in turn contributes to poor MNCH. This research will assess this hypothesis through three specific aims. In Aim 1, I will conduct qualitative interviews with newly married women, their husbands, and mothers-in-law to understand the interactions between gender inequality and food insecurity at the household level. In Aim 2, I will collect longitudinal data with newly married women for 18 months to evaluate how household gender dynamics and food insecurity impact maternal and child health and change in the first 18 months of marriage. In Aim 3, I will build off an existing food insecurity intervention developed by Helen Keller International, to adapt it for newly married women and their households and include an empowerment component, and test the feasibility of this intervention in a small subset of households. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare me for the successful submission of an R01 application to test the intervention developed in Aim 3 in a larger population. Project Narrative In Nepal in 2011 about 30% of children and 27% of women were underweight and just over 50% of household reported some level of food insecurity. Nepal has high levels of gender inequality, reinforced by house dynamics, where young, newly married women have especially low status in the household and are at increased risk of poor health outcomes, yet little research and few interventions have focused on this population. The knowledge gained and the intervention designed in this study will help improve maternal and child health by addressing the intersection of gender inequality and food insecurity among newly married households in Nepal.",Understanding the role of gender inequality and food insecurity on maternal and child health,9315024,K01HD086281,"['Anthropometry ', ' Appointment ', ' Asia ', ' Award ', '

"The Effect of Food Marketing and Attentional Biases on Eating behaviors in the African American Adolescent Girls ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIMHD Strategic Plan proposes a critical focus on studying underlying factors contributing to health disparities, such as obesity, among racial/ethnic minorities. The proposed Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA is a two-year program of research and training focused on uncovering the underlying associations among environmental, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to obesity health disparities among African American (AA) adolescent girls. Rates of overweight/obesity and related comorbidities among AA adolescent girls are much higher than rates in other racial/ethnic groups, highlighting a critical health disparity. AAs who are obese are more likely to remain obese through adulthood and develop health consequences, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Therefore, preventing overweight/obesity in this group is critical. Yet, prevention and intervention efforts must account for the multiple systems that influence obesity risk, specifically individual and environmental factors. AA individuals may be more vulnerable to environmental factors, such as food marketing, compared to other groups. Obese AA adolescents may be more prone to over-attention toward food-related stimuli (i.e., attentional biases [ABs]) increasing the potential rol of food marketing. Together, these factors may lead to unhealthy eating behaviors and increase obesity risk. Among 120 AA obese (n=60) and non-overweight (n=60) adolescent girls, the proposed project will examine the effect of food marketing and ABs on eating behaviors. Food cue ABs will be examined using an attention bias visual dot probe task. Afterwards, AA girls will view a video clip embedded with either a food commercial or a neutral/non-food commercial. Eating behavior will be assessed using a laboratory test meal. This study will evaluate the hypotheses that food marketing and ABs individually impact food consumption among AA adolescent girls. Further, we expect that girls who view the food commercial and have high ABs will consume more overall food. Findings from the proposed study will elucidate the associations among environmental, cognitive, and behavioral factors that may contribute to obesity risk in AA adolescent girls. If successful, this project may assist in identifying individual and environmenta targets for obesity prevention, such as attentional retraining and limits on youth-targeted food marketing, respectively. Data have the potential to build scientific support towards important regulatory policies to encourage alignment of marketing with nutritional guidelines and limits on food marketing towards youth and racial/ethnic minorities. The proposed NRSA will provide conceptual, technical, and professional skills training in understanding socio-ecological factors within health disparities research, psychological theories that drive marketing techniques, ABs, and ways to disseminate research to inform policy. The innovative integration of food marketing, an ABs paradigm, and a laboratory test meal will elucidate how the current food environment, food-related cognitions, and eating behaviors interact to contribute to the development and maintenance of obesity risk in AA girls, a vulnerable group.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American adolescent girls have the highest obesity rates of all other racial/ethnic youth. More food advertisements that promote unhealthy foods are shown to African Americans compared to other groups, which may lead to unhealthy eating and obesity, especially among African American girls who pay more attention to food images than any other images in their environment. Results from this study may help determine individual and environmental changes that must be made in order to reduce these effects in African American girls.        ",The Effect of Food Marketing and Attentional Biases on Eating behaviors in the African American Adolescent Girls,9333972,F31MD010675,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cartoons ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Cues ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Preferences ', ' Health ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maintenance ', ' Marketing ', ' Motivation ', ' Music ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Precipitating Factors ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' Television ', ' Testing ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Clip ', ' density ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' preference ', ' skills training ', ' Participant ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' food craving ', ' Advertisements ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' food consumption ', ' environmental change ', ' obesity prevention ', ' food advertising ', ' food ads ', ' food marketing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' obesity risk ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' nutritional guideline ', ' food environment ', ' cognitive process ', ' attentional bias ', ' sustained attention ', ' Adolescent obesity ', ' obesity among adolescents ', ' obese adolescents ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIMHD,HENRY M.

"The Influence of Quick-Service Restaurants on Children's Diets 7. Project Summary/Abstract Addressing childhood obesity remains one of the greatest public health priorities in the U.S., particularly among minority and lower socioeconomic status (SES) populations where the prevalence of obesity is highest. Studies have found a positive association between quick-service restaurant (QSR) food consumption and body mass index (BMI) among children. This is likely due in part to the high caloric content of foods from QSRs, especially the traditional side dishes and beverages (i.e. fried potato products and sugar-sweetened beverages) which can provide up to 350 additional calories per children’s meal compared with the healthier options available. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence the selection of healthier or less healthy children’s meal side dishes and beverages can have important implications for addressing obesity and health disparities. The proposed research will examine QSR environments (both the physical environment and verbal prompts), as well as parent-child interactions, that promote or discourage the selection of healthier children’s meal side dishes/ beverages. Additionally, we will analyze the impact of healthier side dish/beverage selection on overall meal consumption. Environmental assessments will occur in 136 QSRs in socioeconomically and ethnically diverse communities. Interactions when ordering will be observed among 64 parent-child pairs, and overall meal consumption will be assessed using plate waste methodology among 850 children. Expanding upon Dr. Cohen’s prior nutrition and plate waste research in low-income school districts, this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide additional training in behavior change techniques, qualitative data collection, analyses involving mixed-methods, behavioral/ family-centered theories, and conducting research to address health disparities. Dr. Cohen has the full support of The School of Science and Engineering at Merrimack College, as well as her exceptional, multidisciplinary team of mentors, who are committed to helping Dr. Cohen successfully complete the proposed training and research and become a successful independent researcher. Study results will be used to inform future intervention studies involving both QSRs and families to improve children’s selection/consumption of healthier QSR foods. This award will provide Dr. Cohen with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator conducting cross- disciplinary research that uses behavior change techniques and is informed by studying both environmental influences and the role of parents (applying qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research) to improve the diets of underserved children and reduced their risk of obesity. 8. Project Narrative Children frequently consume foods from quick-service restaurants, which are associated with increased risk of overweight; therefore research is needed to better understand how to improve food selections in this environment. This study will examine the influence of quick-service restaurant environments, as well as parent-child interactions in the restaurants, on children’s side dish and beverage selection and meal consumption. This research will provide an important foundation towards addressing childhood obesity and health disparities, and will improve the diets children in quick-service restaurants.",The Influence of Quick-Service Restaurants on Children's Diets,9330843,K01DK107810,"['Award ', ' Beverages ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' energy source ', ' Energy-Generating Resources ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Selections ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parents ', ' Potato ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Work ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Visual ', ' wasting ', ' sugar ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Calories ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' behavior change ', ' Physical environment ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' Employee ', ' Nutrient ', ' skills ', ' parental role ', ' parent role ', ' parental influence ', ' parent influence ', ' theories ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' Food Energy ', ' food consumption ', ' obesity prevention ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' obesity risk ', ' parental involvement ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health priorities ', ' school district ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Diné Nation ', ' Diné ', ' ']",NIDDK,MERRIMACK COLLEGE,K01,2017,126556,0.19343240252340535
"Understanding the risk of obesity in food-insecure children: the hidden role of stress ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food insecurity, a household condition of limited food availability, affects 16 million US children today. Food- insecure children are at risk for adverse diet-related health conditions; however, the mechanisms underlying these associations have not been clearly identified. Chronic, psychological stress may represent an important pathway between food insecurity and childhood obesity. The effects of chronic stress on children's cognitive development and cardio-metabolic health have been well-documented. However, research of the psychological component of food insecurity is sparse. Understanding the psychosocial and cognitive mechanisms underlying children's experiences of food insecurity is important to inform the development of strategies to reduce children's food insecurity and its sequelae. I am pursuing a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award to fill critical training gaps in the areas of stress mechanisms and measurement, children's development of cognitive processes related to overeating, and causal mediation analysis. This award will build upon my advanced training as a nutrition epidemiologist and my prior research on the relations between participation in the federal food programs and diet-related chronic disease. The detailed training plan includes formal coursework at UCSF and UC Berkeley, meetings, seminars, readings, and research apprenticeships. The research component of my project will provide opportunities to integrate knowledge from these new areas. Through the proposed series of studies, I will test the hypothesis that household food insecurity increases children's psychological stress, which shapes their cognitive processes related to eating behaviors and food choice, and predicts subsequent weight gain. First, I will develop a measure to capture children's psychological stress of food insecurity, drawing from qualitative interviews with food-insecure children and existing measures of children's psychological stress. The measure's psychometric properties will be empirically tested in a separate sample of low-income children. Second, in a laboratory setting, I will determine the extent to which children's food insecurity-stress mediates the relationship between household food insecurity and children's cognitive processes related to overeating, using the newly developed measure. Finally, I will design and conduct a two- year longitudinal study to examine associations between household food insecurity and children's weight gain, and the extent to which this is mediated through the proposed pathway. This program of research will focus on children during the transition to adolescence (ages 8-12), a significant period for cognitive development and weight gain with lifelong implications. These findings will highlight a novel and important pathway to explain the adverse effects of food insecurity on children's developmental and diet-related outcomes. The proposed training plan and series of studies will provide me with a set of skills and expertise needed to successfully compete for funding as an independent investigator and to serve as a leader in developing interventions and policies to minimize food insecurity and promote health in low-income children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Food insecurity has been linked with adverse diet-related health outcomes in children; however, the mechanisms underlying these associations are not well-understood. This project will test the hypothesis that household food insecurity promotes children's psychological stress, which shapes their cognitive processes related to eating behaviors and food choice, predicting subsequent weight gain.

"A multi-component intervention in the hunger relief network to improve diet among adults experiencing food insecurity ABSTRACT  The overarching goal of this application is to evaluate the health impact of an intervention targeting the hunger relief network and the clients with food insecurity it serves. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce nutrition-related health disparities by intervening on a system that serves individuals at high risk for chronic disease. In 2014, an estimated 14% of U.S. households experienced food insecurity (i.e., they lacked access to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members). Large numbers of low-income, racial/ethnic minority, and immigrant families who experience food insecurity rely on a hunger relief network that includes food banks and food pantries. Pantry clients have demonstrated poor nutritional outcomes, high chronic disease rates, and dissatisfaction with the quality and cultural-appropriateness of food offered. Unlike other food assistance programs, there are currently no standards on the nutritional quality of pantry offerings, but recent work by our study team demonstrated the need to improve the healthfulness of hunger relief network inventory. We proposed an evaluation of a randomized, sustainable intervention in 8 intervention and 8 control pantries. We will enroll 272 clients at baseline and follow them for 1 year to assess changes in overall diet quality (the primary outcome). Working with our food bank partners, the intervention at the pantry level targets the supply of nutritious foods, through policy and practice changes and capacity-building. At the client level, the intervention targets healthy food demand, using behavioral economic and educational approaches. Measured outcomes include overall diet quality (the primary outcome), as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI), the nutritional quality of foods selected at the food shelf visit, and cardiovascular disease health (assessed by the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 scores). The study will also evaluate the impact of a multilevel intervention on the nutritional quality of pantry offerings, measured by a Hunger Relief Nutrition Index. The study also aims to improve implementation of policies and practices that promote a nutrition-focused hunger relief network, as assessed by survey and key informant interviews. As an exploratory aim, the study will evaluate the cultural appropriateness of pantry foods and services, given the burden of poor food access on minority, immigrant, and refugee families. After a 1-year needs assessment, an intervention will be conducted in 2 waves in Years 2-3. Years 4-5 will be focused on analysis and local and regional dissemination through channels supported by our partnering agencies. This work capitalizes on a palpable local momentum towards improving the hunger relief system. Research aims address the need for a system- wide approach to improving the hunger relief network and evaluation of its impact on client outcomes. NARRATIVE The hunger safety net fills a critical need among low-income adults with diet-related chronic disease. The challenges faced within the hunger relief network require a multimodal approach for improvement. This study will evaluate the impact of a multicomponent intervention, targeting the supply of healthy food in food pantries and encouraging the selection of healthier items, on client diet and cardiovascular disease risk.",A multi-component intervention in the hunger relief network to improve diet among adults experiencing food insecurity,9284878,R01HL136640,"['Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' food quality ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Food Assistance Programs ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' informant ', ' Minority ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' primary outcome ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' behavioral economics ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Behavior ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Client ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Selections ', ' Food Services ', ' Food Supply ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Hunger ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutrition Indexes ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' improved ', ' diet education ', ' nutrition education ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Immigrant ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' cooking ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Palpable ', ' palpable disease ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2017,685706,0.32212693865208136
"Appalachians Together Restoring the Eating Environment (Appal-TREE): Advancing Sustainable CBPR Interventions to Improve Healthy Diet in Rural Appalachian Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The National Institutes of Health has acknowledged that residents of rural Appalachia experience among the nation's worst health and economic profiles, including disability and premature mortality stemming from elevated rates of heart disease and stroke, various cancers, diabetes, all of which are closely associated with suboptimal dietary intake, obesity, and overweight. Community members are particularly concerned about their children, who have among the highest rates of obesity, overweight, and suboptimal dietary intake in the nation. Eliminating these health disparities requires scientificaly informed community-engaged research to develop and evaluate innovative and sustainable programs and policies. For the proposed application, our community-research team will (1) use an innovative information technology CBPR method - Structured Public Involvement - to refine and tailor a package of pilot tested healthy eating interventions; (2) conduct and evaluate this package of interventions that were found to be feasible, culturally consonant, and promising during R24MD008018 and (3) build community capacity in social marketing, an innovative approach to enhance sustainability of the intervention. Our partners include the Community Farm Alliance, local school districts, the Cooperative Extension Service, and other community organizations. For the first aim, the innovative CBPR approach Structured Public Involvement will allow us to tailor the intervention while maintaining project fidelity. For the second aim, we will administer and evaluate three interrelated interventions to transform access to and intake of healthy foods for Appalachian children; (1) a school-based water campaign to decrease sugar sweetened beverage consumption (2) healthy cooking classes to encourage healthy cooking on a budget; and (3).a farmer's market-based healthy summer feeding program. Finally, in Aim 3, we will administer a CBPR-oriented approach, social marketing, to enhance sustainability, a challenge for all behavioral interventions. Through the schools, we will train teachers and administrators to teach social marketing to students, who will be encouraged to develop marketing campaigns supporting healthy diets. All of these efforts will be developed, implemented, and evaluated in conjunction with our Community Advisory Boards. As one of our local stakeholders told us, ""If you really are what you eat, it's no wonder so many of us are unhealthy."" By developing sustainable, evidence-based programming, we aim to transform consumption patterns and the eating environment so the next generation of rural residents can overcome pernicious health disparities.

"Evaluating a Food Hub Opening in an Urban Context ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food hubs are an emerging and increasingly popular approach to reduce obesity trends by improving diet through increased access to nutritious foods. Food hubs offer a wide variety of healthy foods for purchase by both consumers and other food retailers (e.g., corner stores), and typically operate on a value-based business model that prioritizes both economic development and community benefit. Food hubs may be particularly impactful in ""food desert"" communities that have limited or no access to traditional food retailers, are low income, and have high rates of obesity. However, there is currently no evidence of the influence of a food hub on dietary behaviors related to preventing and reducing obesity. This study will provide programmatic and policy-relevant evidence to close this gap by taking advantage of a time-sensitive opportunity to evaluate a newly forming food hub that will be established through two independent grants awarded to the community (not the research team) in late 2014. The new food hub will open in October 2015, and this rapid response study will provide a chance to collect baseline data prior to opening. The central hypothesis guiding this research is that the food hub will improve both physical and social access to nutritious foods, which will improve diet quality, fruit and vegetable consumption, and caloric intake among people living near the new food hub. Using a quasi-experimental design with repeated measures, changes in diet will be compared between primary food shoppers living in the intervention community receiving the new food hub to those in a matched control community. Dietary changes will be measured at three time points (baseline and 12 and 24 months post food hub) using the Nutrition Data System for Research, the gold standard for assessing 24-hour dietary recalls to examine individual-level changes. At each time point, three dietary recalls will be collected to provide more accurate estimates. The study will examine changes in the three diet outcomes (e.g., diet quality, FV consumption, caloric intake) between residents in the two communities, will assess the extent that psychosocial factors explain these changes, and, among residents in the intervention community, will examine the dose-response relationship between food hub use and changes in diet using objective measures of food hub shopping. Additionally, this research will contribute to the science of food environment interventions to prevent or reduce obesity by assessing the impact of the new food hub on the broader food retail environment. Finally, the study will contribute to the science and practice of implementing food hub interventions by examining how the specific intervention components (such as healthy food incentives, healthy food community organizers, cooking clubs, etc.) are implemented and received by the community as well as intended and unintended consequences. Findings will provide evidence about the extent to which food hub interventions contribute to changes in diet among people living in low-income, urban communities, and will offer guidance for reducing obesity trends and inequities.

"Gentrification, food environment, and risk for obesity: A mixed methods approach ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed pre-doctoral training fellowship serves two overarching goals: 1) To enhance my quantitative and qualitative research methods skills toward applying for and obtaining a mixed methods R01grant; and 2) To apply and refine my public health training by conducting a dissertation research project to understand the effect of the changing food environment on obesity in a historically low-socioeconomic status (SES) community of color undergoing gentrification. Background: Since the late 1990s, the neighborhood of Central Harlem in New York City has been undergoing dramatic transformation as characterized by gentrification, a mixture of divestment and redevelopment. These changes influence the food environment (i.e. grocery outlets, restaurants, street vendors, and farmers' markets) and, with it, residents' food-related practices and health. Given the high rates of nutrition-related conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in Harlem, any transformation in its food environment raises the need for investigation. The overarching question of my dissertation is: How does the changing food environment in Harlem, a neighborhood undergoing gentrification, affect residents' risk for obesity mediated by food-related dispositions and practices? Aims: The specific aims are to: 1) Examine changes in Central Harlem's food environment during 1990-2010 by analyzing the NETS database; 2) Examine whether longitudinal changes in the food practices of mothers and children are associated with changes in weight measurements and risk for obesity using the Columbia Center of Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) cohort data; 2a) Compare changes in the weights of mothers and children who have remained in Central Harlem and those who have moved from the neighborhood; 3) Use ethnographic methods (including participant observation, and in-depth interviews with a sub-set of CCCEH participants) and key informant interviews to explore ongoing changes in Harlem's food environment, and how these changes affect food practices and dispositions, thus corroborating and expanding upon the quantitative findings under Aims 1 and 2; and 4) Integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings and thus develop a provisional conceptual framework to understand the effects of gentrification on obesity as mediated by food practices and dispositions. Methods: Consistent with my training objectives, the study will apply an ethnographic and sociological framework of habitus to examine the relationship between gentrification, habitus and obesity prevalence among residents of a historically resource poor neighborhood. Specifically, I will conduct a mixed methods explanatory sequential design including three phases: 1) secondary longitudinal data analyses of the National Establishments Time-Series database and CCCEH mother-child pairs; 2) qualitative data collection and analysis by employing an ethnography of Harlem's food environment and interview with 15- 20 key informants and 45 CCCEH participants; and 3) integration of findings to develop a provisional conceptual framework that illustrates the effect o gentrification on obesity as mediated by food habitus.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A neighborhood undergoing gentrification, characterized by a mixture of divestment and redevelopment, also experiences changes in its food environment and by extension in its residents' health. Using a mixed methods approach, the proposed study will examine how the changing food environment in a community of color shapes its residents' food-related dispositions and practices and, in turn, determines obesity prevalence. This investigation, the first study of its kind in the United States, will inform obesity prevention polcy and practice, improve the design of multi-level interventions addressing disparities in the obesity epidemic, and enhance our theoretical framework for bridging structural factors to individual health practices.            ","Gentrification, food environment, and risk for obesity: A mixed methods approach",9230782,F31HL131441,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fellowship ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Sociology ', ' Taste Perception ', ' taste response ', ' taste processing ', ' gustatory response ', ' gustatory processing ', ' gustatory perception ', ' Taste ', ' Gustation ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vendor ', ' Weight ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Childbirth ', ' child birth ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Public Health Education ', ' Public Health Training ', ' Public Health Instruction ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' obesity prevention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnographic method ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' obesity risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' doctoral student ', ' food environment ', ' maternal obesity ', ' health of the mother ', ' farmers markets ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2017,35822,0.19643144614635813
"Designing Food Voucher Programs to Reduce Disparities in Healthy Diets Abstract Improving diets through increased food and vegetable (F&V) consumption significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Programs increasing the accessibility and affordability of F&Vs among low-income Americans have been hindered by the food consumption cycle associated with poverty: the tendency to over-consume calories shortly after receiving funds at the beginning of each month, draining the budget for F&V purchases, or for all food purchases, by month's end. Increasing food assistance funding alone does not resolve this problem, but an emerging theory about dietary behavior suggests that providing funds for food in smaller installments distributed throughout the month will smooth the consumption cycle and improve healthy eating—counteracting the tendency to respond to lump sum, once-monthly funding installments by purchasing calorie-dense foods immediately after funds are received. The theory also suggests that funds targeted toward specific healthy foods (e.g., F&Vs) will improve diets more than untargeted funds, despite the in- convenience of utilizing targeted funds. Our preliminary data support both hypotheses, which we will rigorously test in a real-world setting by comparing alternative approaches for delivering food purchasing vouchers. We have established and tested the infrastructure to provide vouchers accepted by all major food stores (e.g., supermarkets, corner shops) in two low-income neighborhoods. Leveraging this innovative infrastructure, in Aim 1 we propose a randomized trial with a two-by-two factorial design, comparing $20 of vouchers valid for one month to four $5 vouchers each valid for a sequential week of the month (lump sum versus distributed funding), and comparing vouchers restricted to F&V purchases to vouchers redeemable for any food (targeted versus untargeted funding). Low-income adults (N=288) recruited through our community partners will be randomized to one of four 6-month interventions: monthly targeted, monthly untargeted, weekly targeted, or weekly untargeted vouchers. Participants will be assessed through efficient verbal 24-hour dietary recalls validated among low-literacy populations, to determine daily consumption of F&Vs and metrics of overall dietary quality at months 0, 6 and 12 (6 months after vouchers end). Additional surveys will identify moderators and mediators of dietary improvement. In Aim 2, we will calculate the cost-effectiveness of the voucher programs. Vouchers and other interventions that support healthy diets reduce population-level CVD disparities over the course of decades. Hence, the full costs and benefits of such interventions are not possible to directly observe through time-limited trials. Following recent NIH policy statements, we will overcome this problem by applying an innovative, validated microsimulation modeling approach—a systems science method that integrates trial results with comprehensive data on the effect of dietary changes on CVD risks and costs over the life course. We will identify which voucher delivery strategies cost-effectively reduce CVD disparities—addressing a key scientific uncertainty in healthy eating intervention research. Public health relevance This study tackles a stubborn scientific issue—how to design and implement cost-effective interventions to support healthy eating among low-income populations—in an effort to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities between low- and higher-income Americans. We will test two hypotheses: that increasing the fre- quency of food assistance but not the overall amount of the assistance, and targeting such assistance towards healthy fruits and vegetables, increases dietary quality in a manner that can cost-effectively reduce CVD dis- parities. Our test of both hypotheses is of potentially high impact and timely, as 1 in 7 Americans are currently enrolled in nutrition programs that use monthly, untargeted funding approaches, but program directors are considering new approaches to reduce disparities in healthy diets through program modifications.",Designing Food Voucher Programs to Reduce Disparities in Healthy Diets,9302830,R01HL132814,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Budgets ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Reducing diet ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Vegetables ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' improved ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' good diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' meetings ', ' Supermarket ', ' American ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Sum ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Low Literacy Population ', ' Modification ', ' food consumption ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' federal poverty level ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' farmers markets ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,758459,0.17111252120019357
"Community-Based Dietary Approach for Hypertensive African Americans with Chronic Kidney Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) when compared to whites. Racial disparities are most profound among persons of low socioeconomic status (SES) and dietary factors likely underlie much of this disparity. Low SES AAs are more likely to experience food insecurity and live in ""food deserts"" and are less likely to follow a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordant diet than are whites. This is despite evidence that adherence to the DASH diet may have greater blood pressure benefit for AAs than whites, and evidence that the DASH diet may slow CKD progression (including reductions in urine albumin excretion). We propose to build upon encouraging results of our pilot study, ""The Five-Plus Nuts and Beans Trial"", which was conducted as a partnership between Johns Hopkins investigators, a community supermarket, the Baltimore City Health Department's ""Virtual Supermarket"" program, a community-based clinic and a highly engaged Community Advisory Board. This randomized trial tested the effects of a dietary approach to increase consumption of a central feature of the DASH diet--high potassium foods. A total of 123 AA patients with controlled hypertension, and recruited from a community-based clinic, were provided personalized dietary advice, assistance with grocery ordering and delivery, and $30 per week worth of high potassium foods for an 8-week period. With this approach, we demonstrated statistically significant increases in consumption of fruits, vegetables, potassium, magnesium and fiber, and decreases in sodium intake. Also, there was a 14% reduction in urinary albumin excretion overall, and a 30% reduction among patients with significant albuminuria at enrollment. In this application, we propose a larger (n=150) and longer (1 year) trial of a dietary intervention in AAs with hypertension (controlled or uncontrolled) plus mild/moderate CKD-a population at very high risk of the adverse effects of poor diets. The primary aim, in the setting of a randomized trial, is to test the hypothesis that delivery of nutritional advice to adopt the DASH diet and $30 per week worth of potassium-rich foods, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores of patients recruited from community-based clinics, will reduce blood pressure and reduce urinary albumin excretion in low SES AAs with hypertension and CKD. Strengths of our proposal include the integration of an experienced, highly collaborative team of investigators with expertise in clinical trials, nephrology, health disparities, community-based participatory research, integration of trials into primary care practices, and statistical analyses The investigation team includes a highly involved Community Advisory Board, and has an established close partnership with Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, the Baltimore City Health Department and local supermarkets. If our hypothesis is correct, then our trial will establish an immediately translatable, inexpensive, and safe approach for adjuvant therapy in the treatment of hypertension and kidney damage (albuminuria) among low SES AAs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are disproportionately affected by hypertension and kidney disease in the United States, and these disparities are particularly apparent among socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans. Limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy diets likely contribute to these disparities. In this community-based randomized clinical trial, we will test whether delivering nutritional advice to adopt the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and $30 per week worth of fruits and vegetables, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores, will reduce blood pressure and kidney damage in socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans with

"Diet and Health Behavior Change to Improve Bone Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sabrina Noel, PhD, RD is currently a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. She has advanced training in nutrition and epidemiology and experience working in both clinical and community settings. Dr. Noel's experience with diet and metabolic health research, and exposure to work with disparities in bone health, has encouraged her to pursue a career in population-based bone research. Her goal is to evaluate the effects of dietary quality on bone health and to develop a culturally and literacy-tailored behavior change intervention targeting dietary and physical activity behaviors among Caribbean Hispanic adults. In contrast to what has been earlier believed, Hispanics have recently been shown to have higher prevalence of osteoporosis, compared with non-Hispanic whites; however, most of this research has focused on Mexican Americans because of their majority status in the U.S. Hispanic population. Caribbean origin Hispanics are one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. population and are underrepresented in bone- related research. Preliminary data from a large study of Puerto Rican adults in Boston, MA, indicates that Caribbean Hispanics are at higher risk for osteoporosis than previously thought. Identifying modifiable health behaviors, such as diet and physical activity, to prevent bone loss is an important public health priority, as adherence to bone medications is generally poor. Increasing evidence suggests that overall dietary quality is critical for bone health; however, studies that use predefined dietary patterns as a measure of overall dietary quality have reported inconsistent associations with bone outcomes. This is likely due to the fact that nutrients and foods known to be important for bone are underrepresented in these existing indices. We, therefore, propose to develop a bone-specific dietary quality index with nationally based data, and to then adapt it to include ethnic (Caribbean Latino) specific food choices related to bone health. Few theory-based interventions have targeted both dietary and physical activity behaviors to promote bone health and none that we know of have focused on overall dietary quality or on Caribbean origin Hispanic adults. This K01 award will provide Dr. Noel with training and research experience in bone health and osteoporosis prevention, health behavior theory, behavioral intervention design, implementation and evaluation, and advanced biostatistics. This training will help Dr. Noel achieve her long-term career goals of becoming a leading independent investigator in nutrition and bone health with expertise in designing and conducting culturally tailored behavioral interventions to improve bone health in diverse populations. Dr. Noel's mentors are highly committed to her career development and future success and will help her build additional knowledge and skills in bone health and intervention research. Dr. Noel's proposed research aims are to: 1) develop a bone-specific dietary quality index that emphasizes specific foods and nutrients known to be important for bone; and to evaluate the effects of a resulting dietary quality score on bone health using national survey data; 2) to adapt the index to include ethnic-specific food choices of Caribbean origin Hispanics, using data from an existing study of Puerto Rican adults, to guide the dietary component of a lifestyle behavior change intervention and; 3) to adapt and pilot test the feasibility and preliminary impact of a theory-based cultural and literacy-tailored intervention to improve dietary and physical activity behaviors among 60 Caribbean origin Hispanic adults. This bone-focused intervention will be modeled after another unique behavioral intervention, which successfully improved dietary quality and other health behaviors in low-income Caribbean Latinos. Innovative strategies, including narrative forms of communication, will be employed to help individuals adopt healthy behaviors. This work will inform a larger scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the behavioral intervention on bone outcomes in Caribbean Hispanics. This has the potential to have significant public health implications for improving bone health and preventing osteoporosis in high-risk, underserved ethnic minority populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoporosis is an increasing health concern among U.S. Hispanic adults.

"An Exercise Intervention to Improve the Eating Patterns of Preadolescent Children at High Risk for Obesity. 7. Project Summary/Abstract  Children in rural communities experience significant obesity-related health disparities; they are 26%–55% more likely to be obese and less likely to have health insurance and access to weight management specialists than are their urban peers. Geographic-specific disparities in obesity may be due, in part, to variations in energy intake (EI). Children in rural communities describe purchasing and consuming significantly more energy-dense, low-nutrient food items relative to their urban peers. Existing behavioral strategies for improving children's EI patterns have largely been ineffective in reducing risk for excess weight gain. The primary aim of the proposed study is to test the effects of a brief, novel strategy for improving rural children's daily EI. Specifically, the study aims to harness the well-documented benefits of an acute bout (20 min) of moderate physical exercise on children's executive functioning (EF), and to see if these cognitive changes lead to better self-regulation of EI. In a randomized crossover design, 90 preadolescent children (ages 8–10 y; 50% female; 50% obese) will complete two separate conditions (physical activity, sedentary control) on two separate days. In the physical activity condition, children will walk at a moderate pace on a treadmill for 20 min. In the sedentary condition, children will read magazines/books for 20 min. Immediately following each condition, children's EF will be assessed with a brief (3 min) inhibitory control task. EI will then be assessed during a large multi-array buffet test meal. If 20 min of moderate physical exercise is associated with observed improvements in preadolescent children's EI secondary to increases in EF, these data may offer explicit targets for an obesity prevention trial in rural Oregon elementary schools. Such a trial may include introducing 20 min of moderate physical exercise immediately before children's lunchtime food exposure. To begin exploring how experimental, mechanistic data from the proposed study could be scaled up in the natural school environment, qualitative data will also be collected from teachers, staff, and volunteers at an elementary school in rural Oregon as they begin the process of moving recess from immediately after to immediately before lunch. The Active Implementation Frameworks, an evidence-based implementation science tool, will assist with the development of a semi-structured interview to explore the barriers to, and facilitators of, effectively implementing this recess-related change. A team of 11–15 relevant school stakeholders will be approached to discuss organizational fit, need, resources, readiness, and capacity. This approach uses the Active Implementation Frameworks to strengthen the infrastructure for implementing a future effectiveness trial in the local context. A school-based obesity prevention trial in which a brief bout of physical exercise is introduced immediately before lunchtime food exposure would offer diffuse benefits with regard to children's health, well-being, and cognitive functioning; is likely to be well received by parents, staff, and policymakers; and may address significant geographic-related disparities in EI and obesity. 8. Project Narrative  Children in rural communities experience significant obesity-related disparities and report worse eating habits than do their urban peers; as such, novel strategies for improving rural children's eating habits are needed. The proposed study will test the efficacy of a brief bout of moderate physical exercise to increase the executive functioning and subsequent self-regulation of the food consumption of preadolescent children in rural communities. A 20-min physical activity intervention introduced immediately before lunchtime food exposure in rural schools may prompt acute improvements in children's eating habits, thereby reducing their risk for excess weight gain and chronic disease development.",An Exercise Intervention to Improve the Eating Patterns of Preadolescent Children at High Risk for Obesity.,9486146,R21HD094661,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Beverages ', ' Books ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Female ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Oregon ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Play ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Video Games ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Diet Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Mediating ', ' Rural Community ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' sedentary ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' teacher ', ' Rural ', ' sugar ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' cognitive function ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Pattern ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Palate ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Aerobic ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' obesity in children ', ' food consumption ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' obesity prevention ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' scale up ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' obesity risk ', ' volunteer ', ' implementation science ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive process ', ' Exercise intervention ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' treadmill ', ' urban school ', ' rural setting ', ' Child Health ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2018,221250,0.08393747835033492
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"A multi-component intervention in the hunger relief network to improve diet among adults experiencing food insecurity ABSTRACT  The overarching goal of this application is to evaluate the health impact of an intervention targeting the hunger relief network and the clients with food insecurity it serves. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce nutrition-related health disparities by intervening on a system that serves individuals at high risk for chronic disease. In 2014, an estimated 14% of U.S. households experienced food insecurity (i.e., they lacked access to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members). Large numbers of low-income, racial/ethnic minority, and immigrant families who experience food insecurity rely on a hunger relief network that includes food banks and food pantries. Pantry clients have demonstrated poor nutritional outcomes, high chronic disease rates, and dissatisfaction with the quality and cultural-appropriateness of food offered. Unlike other food assistance programs, there are currently no standards on the nutritional quality of pantry offerings, but recent work by our study team demonstrated the need to improve the healthfulness of hunger relief network inventory. We proposed an evaluation of a randomized, sustainable intervention in 8 intervention and 8 control pantries. We will enroll 272 clients at baseline and follow them for 1 year to assess changes in overall diet quality (the primary outcome). Working with our food bank partners, the intervention at the pantry level targets the supply of nutritious foods, through policy and practice changes and capacity-building. At the client level, the intervention targets healthy food demand, using behavioral economic and educational approaches. Measured outcomes include overall diet quality (the primary outcome), as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI), the nutritional quality of foods selected at the food shelf visit, and cardiovascular disease health (assessed by the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 scores). The study will also evaluate the impact of a multilevel intervention on the nutritional quality of pantry offerings, measured by a Hunger Relief Nutrition Index. The study also aims to improve implementation of policies and practices that promote a nutrition-focused hunger relief network, as assessed by survey and key informant interviews. As an exploratory aim, the study will evaluate the cultural appropriateness of pantry foods and services, given the burden of poor food access on minority, immigrant, and refugee families. After a 1-year needs assessment, an intervention will be conducted in 2 waves in Years 2-3. Years 4-5 will be focused on analysis and local and regional dissemination through channels supported by our partnering agencies. This work capitalizes on a palpable local momentum towards improving the hunger relief system. Research aims address the need for a system- wide approach to improving the hunger relief network and evaluation of its impact on client outcomes. NARRATIVE The hunger safety net fills a critical need among low-income adults with diet-related chronic disease. The challenges faced within the hunger relief network require a multimodal approach for improvement. This study will evaluate the impact of a multicomponent intervention, targeting the supply of healthy food in food pantries and encouraging the selection of healthier items, on client diet and cardiovascular disease risk.",A multi-component intervention in the hunger relief network to improve diet among adults experiencing food insecurity,9469543,R01HL136640,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Behavior ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Client ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' whole grain ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Selections ', ' Food Services ', ' Food Supply ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Hunger ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutrition Indexes ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' improved ', ' diet education ', ' nutrition education ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Immigrant ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' cooking ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Palpable ', ' palpable disease ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' food quality ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Food Assistance Programs ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' informant ', ' Minority ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' primary outcome ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' behavioral economics ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,870929,0.32212693865208136
"The Influence of Quick-Service Restaurants on Children's Diets 7. Project Summary/Abstract Addressing childhood obesity remains one of the greatest public health priorities in the U.S., particularly among minority and lower socioeconomic status (SES) populations where the prevalence of obesity is highest. Studies have found a positive association between quick-service restaurant (QSR) food consumption and body mass index (BMI) among children. This is likely due in part to the high caloric content of foods from QSRs, especially the traditional side dishes and beverages (i.e. fried potato products and sugar-sweetened beverages) which can provide up to 350 additional calories per children’s meal compared with the healthier options available. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence the selection of healthier or less healthy children’s meal side dishes and beverages can have important implications for addressing obesity and health disparities. The proposed research will examine QSR environments (both the physical environment and verbal prompts), as well as parent-child interactions, that promote or discourage the selection of healthier children’s meal side dishes/ beverages. Additionally, we will analyze the impact of healthier side dish/beverage selection on overall meal consumption. Environmental assessments will occur in 136 QSRs in socioeconomically and ethnically diverse communities. Interactions when ordering will be observed among 64 parent-child pairs, and overall meal consumption will be assessed using plate waste methodology among 850 children. Expanding upon Dr. Cohen’s prior nutrition and plate waste research in low-income school districts, this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide additional training in behavior change techniques, qualitative data collection, analyses involving mixed-methods, behavioral/ family-centered theories, and conducting research to address health disparities. Dr. Cohen has the full support of The School of Science and Engineering at Merrimack College, as well as her exceptional, multidisciplinary team of mentors, who are committed to helping Dr. Cohen successfully complete the proposed training and research and become a successful independent researcher. Study results will be used to inform future intervention studies involving both QSRs and families to improve children’s selection/consumption of healthier QSR foods. This award will provide Dr. Cohen with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator conducting cross- disciplinary research that uses behavior change techniques and is informed by studying both environmental influences and the role of parents (applying qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research) to improve the diets of underserved children and reduced their risk of obesity. 8. Project Narrative Children frequently consume foods from quick-service restaurants, which are associated with increased risk of overweight; therefore research is needed to better understand how to improve food selections in this environment. This study will examine the influence of quick-service restaurant environments, as well as parent-child interactions in the restaurants, on children’s side dish and beverage selection and meal consumption.

"Race and the transformation of the food environment:  Fast food, African Americans, and the color line, 1955-1995 African Americans suffer from a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality from a wide spectrum of conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer, and these disparities are not attributable solely to individual socioeconomic status or access to health care. Research has shown that social determinants are key factors in African American health and health disparities. Evidence is mounting for the health impact of neighborhood context, particularly with regard to the food environment. Several studies have documented that African American communities are disproportionately exposed to fast food, and other studies have shown that exposure to fast food is associated with greater risk of obesity and other chronic disease. What have been little studied are the complex historical drivers of racially patterned exposure to fast food. Research is needed to interrogate the forces that moved fast food from its historical origins of middle-class White suburban and rural communities to the predominantly Black central city. The proposed study seeks to advance research on social determinants of health by conducting historical analyses of the racial transformation of fast food in the U.S. from 1955 to 1995, focusing on large cities with large Black populations in the Midwest and Northeast. Drawing on archival resources from a number of collections, I will produce a book that will be of interest to scholars in public health, the social sciences and the humanities. In so doing, the proposed work will make an innovative contribution to understanding what puts African Americans at risk of health risks. Project Narrative This project focuses on the history of fast food in urban African American neighborhoods in the U.S. The project will study when and how fast food shifted its target consumers, moving from the predominantly White middle class suburbs where fast food chains became popular, to predominantly Black central city communities, where they are most dense today. The project has strong relevance for public health because it investigates the forces that have shaped the food environment in African American communities, which is important to understanding the context of chronic disease.","Race and the transformation of the food environment:  Fast food, African Americans, and the color line, 1955-1995",9555033,G13LM012463,"['Accounting ', ' Advertising ', ' Archives ', ' Attention ', ' Books ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Central City ', ' Chicago ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Economics ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Humanities ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Ownership ', ' Periodicals ', ' Politics ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Scholarship ', ' Social Sciences ', ' State Government ', ' Provincial Government ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Businesses ', ' Rural Community ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' TimeLine ', ' base ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Food Industry ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Food Chain ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' consumer demand ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' obesity risk ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' public health relevance ', ' social health determinants ', ' food environment ', ' health data ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' suburban communities ', ' adults with obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adult obesity ', ' Food production ', ' ']",NLM,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",G13,2018,50000,0.2616019937729221
"Dietary Quality, Cognitive Decline and Brain Health in Puerto Rican Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this proposal is that consumption of highly processed foods contributes to cognitive decline with aging. These dietary effects may lead to health disparities in cognitive decline due to the known greater consumption of highly processed foods in low-income populations. While many factors are associated with the effects of a diet characterized by highly processed foods, including displacement of healthy foods and the myriad of nutrients associated with these, we propose that two nutrients, in particular, may have effects through known or emerging pathways that affect brain function. First, there is evidence that highly processed foods contribute to greater intake of phosphorus (P) through P-based food additives which can increase food P content by ≥70%. Vascular risk factors predict cognitive decline and excess P may elevate CVD risk. However, the role of P in cognitive decline remains unclear. One novel pathway is compensatory elevation in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a predictor of vascular calcification and CVD. Klotho, a putative anti-aging factor, may be protective against CVD and cognitive decline. Among mice, a high P diet reduced klotho secretion. Excessive P consumption may lower klotho and impair cognitive function through modulation of FGF23, but human data remain sparse. P also elevates parathyroid hormone (PTH), which predicts CVD mortality and presence of cerebral infarcts. Second, vitamin B6 (B6), a critical cofactor for ≥100 metabolic reactions, is easily lost with food processing and unlike other B vitamins is not added back to enriched grains. We have shown that low B6 status was associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and depressive symptoms in Puerto Rican adults. Earlier work with non-Hispanic white men, showed associations of both diet and plasma B6 (pyridoxl-5'-phosphate,PLP) with 3 y cognitive decline. Latinos appear to be disproportionately burdened by cognitive impairment compared to non-Hispanic whites. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that Puerto Ricans have >twice the odds of low global cognitive function compared to Mexicans. With the growing and aging Latino population in the U.S likely to contribute to major increases in the burden of cognitive decline, it is critical that we improve our understanding of preventive risk factors that may inform interventions. We will use data from the Boston Puerto Rican Health study (BPRHS), a longitudinal cohort study of U.S. mainland Puerto Ricans (45-74 y) with diet, nutritional biomarkers, and cognitive function testing data available at baseline and 2 and 5 y follow-up. We will recruit BPRHS participants to return (~ 8-y from baseline) for a repeat battery of cognitive exams and, for a subset, an MRI scan. We will quantify the associations between processed foods consumption, P status (serum P, FGF23, klotho, and PTH), dietary B6, and PLP, as exposures, with ~8 y cognitive decline (psychometric testing) and brain structure, cerebral infarcts, white matter integrity, and connectivity (MRI) at ~8 y, as outcomes. Further the potential mediative roles of inflammation (CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) will be measured. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive decline is an increasing health concern among U.S. Latino adults, particularly those of Puerto Rican heritage. The proposed project aims to quantify the importance of highly processed foods consumption and phosphorus and vitamin B6 status in relation to cognitive decline (psychometric testing) and brain health (MRI) among older U.S. mainland Puerto Rican adults. With the growing and aging Latino population in the U.S likely to contribute to major increases in the burden of cognitive decline, these data will provide critical information to improve our understanding of preventive risk factors that may inform interventions.","Dietary Quality, Cognitive Decline and Brain Health in Puerto Rican Adults",9566108,R01AG055948,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', '

"A natural experiment evaluating the effect of a minimum wage increase on obesity and diet-related outcome Minimum wage laws are increasingly being recognized as a possible policy lever for improving population health and health equity, with the potential for implementation at the local, state, and national levels. On June 30, 2017, Minneapolis, Minnesota became the 40th local jurisdiction to set the minimum wage above the state level. The city will incrementally increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by July 1, 2022 for all firms with greater than 100 employees; minimum wage in smaller firms will increase to $13.50 during this time period. The ordinance is expected to increase wages among the 71,000 workers likely to be affected, who are disproportionately non-Hispanic black and Hispanic workers. The available evidence suggests that minimum wage laws may be associated with a range of health outcomes. This includes obesity, as increasing wages can improve food security and reduce cost constraints for purchasing healthier foods. However, existing studies linking wages and weight have design weaknesses that limit causal inference and the ability to identify causal mechanisms. This study, which has a prospective quasi-experimental design with a strong counterfactual condition, is the next step for testing whether and how an increase in minimum wage results in improved obesity-related outcomes among low-wage workers. Throughout the 4.5-year implementation of the Minneapolis minimum wage ordinance, we will follow a cohort of low-wage workers (those earning less than $10 an hour at baseline) in a natural experiment, using a difference-in-difference design to compare a panel of obesity-related measures in a cohort of low-wage workers in Minneapolis (n = 400) and similar workers in a matched control community (n = 400), Raleigh, NC. The control city has a statewide preemption law which prohibits local minimum wage increases. Measures for all individuals will be collected at baseline (T0) and after 5 incremental wage increases (T1-T5) through June 2022. The study aims to test the difference in change in body mass index (BMI, the primary outcome) between individuals in the two conditions, as assessed by anthropometric height-weight measurements. We will also test the difference in change in the two conditions for a range of nutrition-related outcomes, including purchases of healthier and less healthy foods (measured by food purchase receipts), food insecurity (measured by a 6-item USDA measure), and participation in government food assistance programs (measured by participant survey). Finally, we will test other behavioral and psychosocial mechanisms through which wages might affect obesity, and explore spending changes in household health-related expenses over time. Minimum wage laws are a potential upstream approach to prevent obesity, and these policies may be uniquely positioned to reduce health disparities because they intervene on a population (lower-income, high racial/ethnic minority) at the highest risk for poor health. This natural experiment offers a time-sensitive opportunity to test policy effects and contribute a rare health-oriented perspective to the national discourse around the effects of an economic policy. NARRATIVE At present, millions of workers in the United States earn the federal minimum wage of $7.25 or less. Low-income individuals are at an increased risk for obesity and related chronic diseases; raising the minimum wage has the potential to affect obesity by reducing many of its risk factors. In this R01, we will test the effect of an increase in the local minimum wage on changes in obesity-related risk over 5 years.",A natural experiment evaluating the effect of a minimum wage increase on obesity and diet-related outcome,9598281,R01DK118664,"['Affect ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Expenditure ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Laws ', ' Minnesota ', ' North Carolina ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Step Tests ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Economic Policy ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Hour ', ' S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine ', ' SNAP ', ' Height ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Employee ', ' preempt ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Food Assistance Programs ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Behavioral ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' food security ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' obesity risk ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' health equity ', ' population health ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,738213,0.09870352892570088
"Understanding the risk of obesity in food-insecure children: the hidden role of stress ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food insecurity, a household condition of limited food availability, affects 16 million US children today. Food- insecure children are at risk for adverse diet-related health conditions; however, the mechanisms underlying these associations have not been clearly identified. Chronic, psychological stress may represent an important pathway between food insecurity and childhood obesity. The effects of chronic stress on children's cognitive development and cardio-metabolic health have been well-documented. However, research of the psychological component of food insecurity is sparse. Understanding the psychosocial and cognitive mechanisms underlying children's experiences of food insecurity is important to inform the development of strategies to reduce children's food insecurity and its sequelae. I am pursuing a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award to fill critical training gaps in the areas of stress mechanisms and measurement, children's development of cognitive processes related to overeating, and causal mediation analysis. This award will build upon my advanced training as a nutrition epidemiologist and my prior research on the relations between participation in the federal food programs and diet-related chronic disease. The detailed training plan includes formal coursework at UCSF and UC Berkeley, meetings, seminars, readings, and research apprenticeships. The research component of my project will provide opportunities to integrate knowledge from these new areas. Through the proposed series of studies, I will test the hypothesis that household food insecurity increases children's psychological stress, which shapes their cognitive processes related to eating behaviors and food choice, and predicts subsequent weight gain. First, I will develop a measure to capture children's psychological stress of food insecurity, drawing from qualitative interviews with food-insecure children and existing measures of children's psychological stress. The measure's psychometric properties will be empirically tested in a separate sample of low-income children. Second, in a laboratory setting, I will determine the extent to which children's food insecurity-stress mediates the relationship between household food insecurity and children's cognitive processes related to overeating, using the newly developed measure. Finally, I will design and conduct a two- year longitudinal study to examine associations between household food insecurity and children's weight gain, and the extent to which this is mediated through the proposed pathway. This program of research will focus on children during the transition to adolescence (ages 8-12), a significant period for cognitive development and weight gain with lifelong implications. These findings will highlight a novel and important pathway to explain the adverse effects of food insecurity on children's developmental and diet-related outcomes. The proposed training plan and series of studies will provide me with a set of skills and expertise needed to successfully compete for funding as an independent investigator and to serve as a leader in developing interventions and policies to minimize food insecurity and promote health in low-income children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Food insecurity has been linked with adverse diet-related health outcomes in children; however, the mechanisms underlying these associations are not well-understood. This project will test the hypothesis that household food insecurity promotes children's psychological stress, which shapes their cognitive processes related to eating behaviors and food choice, predicting subsequent weight gain. The proposed research may hold particular promise for interventions and policies that simultaneously address food insecurity and promote children's health.",Understanding the risk of obesity in food-insecure children: the hidden role of stress,9551699,R00HD084758,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Household ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Reading ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' maternal stress ', ' stressed mothers ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Cognitive ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' obesity in children ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' obesity risk ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive development ', ' apprentice ', ' apprenticeship ', ' Child Health ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R00,2018,248998,0.2226259686262015
"Impact of Disparities in Food Security on Glycemic Control and Health Care Utilization Among Youth and Young Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Despite recent advances in therapy, far too many youth and young adults (YYAs) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly those of minority race/ethnicity, do not achieve optimal glycemic control thus placing them at increased risk of acute and chronic complications. Among the social determinants of health, household food insecurity (HFI) may be a key barrier to achieving glycemic control and may lead to increased health care utilization and costs, but virtually all of the limited research was cross-sectional and conducted in older adults with T2D. Moreover, racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by HFI, which may underlie similar disparities in diabetes outcomes. Our preliminary work suggests that HFI is a common phenomenon in YYAs with diabetes, affecting 19% of YYAs with T1D and 38% of those with T2D. These rates significantly exceed the 2015 national estimate of 12.7%. We propose a longitudinal study, the SEARCH Food Security (SFS) cohort study, which is designed as an ancillary study to the ongoing CDC/DDT- and NIH/NIDDK-funded SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth 4 study, a racially/ethnically diverse study of diabetes diagnosed in youth. The aims of the SFS study are to: (1) Initiate a food insecurity cohort study of 1,187 YYAs aged 15-35 years (53% minority) with T1D and T2D by adding two data collection time points to the ongoing SEARCH 4 study; (2) Prospectively evaluate the influence of HFI on changes in glycemic control in YYAs with T1D and T2D; (3) Quantify the mediating role of nutritional, mental health, and behavioral pathways through which food insecurity may affect changes in glycemic control in YYAs with T1D and T2D; and (4) Prospectively evaluate the influence of HFI on changes in health care utilization and medical and non-medical health care costs in YYAs with T1D and T2D. Using the SFS data in tandem with extensive data collected by SEARCH will be highly efficient for addressing these aims. The proposed study will be the first cohort study to examine the impact of food insecurity on glycemic control, health care utilization, and costs among a diverse population of US YYAs with T1D and T2D. Our transdisciplinary team is led by Drs. Liese and Mendoza, recognized experts in diabetes, epidemiology, pediatric medicine, disparities, and food insecurity research, and is supported by a team comprising expertise in pediatric endocrinology, psychology, health behaviors, health economics, biostatistics, and causal inference modeling. The study has the potential to alter diabetes policy and clinical practice by establishing the need for more in-depth assessments of food insecurity among YYAs with diabetes, re-assessment of diabetes management and nutrition recommendations for food-insecure patients, and integration of food assistance resources into routine care for persons with diabetes. It will also inform the tailoring of interventions to address food insecurity, especially for minorities, in future diabetes research trials. NARRATIVE Good glycemic control is important for optimal health and prevention of acute and chronic complications among people living with diabetes but food insecurity seems to be a serious barrier to achieving good glycemic control, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. This is the first longitudinal study that will characterize the mechanisms by which food insecurity affects glycemic control and the impact it has on health care utilization and medical and non-medical health care cost in youth and young adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",Impact of Disparities in Food Security on Glycemic Control and Health Care Utilization Among Youth and Young Adults with Diabetes,9526610,R01DK117461,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Buffers ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type one diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Diet ', ' diabetes nutrition ', ' Diabetic Ketoacidosis ', ' diabetic ketoacidotic ', ' Diabetic Ketosis ', ' Diabetic Acidosis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Endocrinology ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Household ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Morbidity -

"Evaluation and Enhancement of the Summer Food Service Program in Youth from an Urban, Low-Resource Community PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal entitled, ‘Evaluation and enhancement of the Summer Food Service Program in youth from an urban, low-resource community’, is for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) for Dr. E. Whitney Evans, PhD, RD an Instructor (Research) at the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center (WCDRC) at The Miriam Hospital and Brown University Medical School. Dr. Evans received her PhD in nutritional epidemiology from the Tufts University Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, where she developed expertise in nutrition and the analytical skills to study the role of diet in relative weight in youth. Dr. Evans’ long-term career goal is to draw upon this background to design and conduct innovative obesity interventions specific to low-income youth. Thus, in response to evidence that low-income youth are at increased risk for excess summer weight gain, this application focuses on an existing federal nutrition assistance program – the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) – to determine how it can be enhanced to minimize income-related health disparities.  To help Dr. Evans successfully carry out this research and achieve her long-term career goal, this award will provide training in four key content areas: 1) qualitative research methods, 2) the design and conduct of behavioral obesity interventions, 3) advanced statistical methods to analyze data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 4) weight-related health disparities. This training will occur through formal didactics and hands-on research experience under the guidance of a highly qualified team of mentors. Dr. Evans will work closely with her primary mentor, Dr. Rena Wing, an internationally recognized obesity researcher, and four co- mentors: Dr. Sara Folta (qualitative research methods); Dr. Elissa Jelalian (behavioral obesity interventions for youth); Dr. Richard Jones (RCT statistical analysis); and Dr. Elsie Taveras (weight-related health disparities).  Through three complimentary studies, the proposed research project will thoroughly evaluate the SFSP. First, it will examine how dietary intake patterns (total energy intake and diet quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index, 2010), change in BMI z-score (as a proxy for change in total body adiposity), and SFSP participation over the summer relate to each other low-income schoolchildren, ages 6-12 years. Second, through focus groups with low-income families, it will identify motivators for and barriers to SFSP participation. Findings from these two formative studies along with the training Dr. Evans receives in behavioral obesity intervention development will be used to design an enhanced version of the SFSP. The enhanced SFSP will target relevant obesity risk factors identified in study 1 as well as SFSP participation barriers identified in study 2 to improve SFSP engagement. The feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of this enhanced version of the SFSP will then be compared to the standard SFSP in an RCT on the basis of participation, diet and excess summer weight gain. This research will form the basis for a larger efficacy trial of the intervention to be proposed in an R01 application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed K01 application is designed to assist Dr. Evans in establishing an independent research career in the field of childhood obesity by providing training, experience and mentorship in the areas of: (1) qualitative research, (2) innovative behavioral obesity interventions; (3) advanced statistical skills to analyze data from randomized controlled trials; and (4) weight-related health disparities. As obesity prevalence continues to rise among low-income youth, there is a need for novel interventions that specifically help them manage income- related barriers and prevent excess weight gain. Through three complimentary studies with children from a low-resource, urban community, the proposed research project will clarify how participation in the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), dietary intake patterns and excess summer weight gain relate to each other, identify salient barriers to SFSP participation, and test whether an enhanced version of the SFSP is more acceptable and effective at preventing excess weight gain than the standard program.","Evaluation and Enhancement of the Summer Food Service Program in Youth from an Urban, Low-Resource Community",9487244,K01DK110142,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' whole grain ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Services ', ' Foundations ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Lipids ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' good diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' psychosocial ', ' instructor ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Dietary intake ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' nutritional epidemiology ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' International ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Science Policy ', ' Behavioral ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' obesity in children ', ' obesity prevention ', ' cost ', ' national surveillance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' obesity risk ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' surveillance data ', ' healthy weight ', ' nutrition science ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' summer session ', ' summer program ', ' hands on research ', ' urban children ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' lower income families ', ' service programs ', ' obesity development ', ' ']",NIDDK,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,K01,2018,141686,0.08841343958824498
"Diet and Health Behavior Change to Improve Bone Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sabrina Noel, PhD, RD is currently a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. She has advanced training in nutrition and epidemiology and experience working in both clinical and community settings. Dr. Noel's experience with diet and metabolic health research, and exposure to work with disparities in bone health, has encouraged her to pursue a career in population-based bone research. Her goal is to evaluate the effects of dietary quality on bone health and to develop a culturally and literacy-tailored behavior change intervention targeting dietary and physical activity behaviors among Caribbean Hispanic adults. In contrast to what has been earlier believed, Hispanics have recently been shown to have higher prevalence of osteoporosis, compared with non-Hispanic whites; however, most of this research has focused on Mexican Americans because of their majority status in the U.S. Hispanic population. Caribbean origin Hispanics are one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. population and are underrepresented in bone- related research. Preliminary data from a large study of Puerto Rican adults in Boston, MA, indicates that Caribbean Hispanics are at higher risk for osteoporosis than previously thought. Identifying modifiable health behaviors, such as diet and physical activity, to prevent bone loss is an important public health priority, as adherence to bone medications is generally poor. Increasing evidence suggests that overall dietary quality is critical for bone health; however, studies that use predefined dietary patterns as a measure of overall dietary quality have reported inconsistent associations with bone outcomes. This is likely due to the fact that nutrients and foods known to be important for bone are underrepresented in these existing indices. We, therefore, propose to develop a bone-specific dietary quality index with nationally based data, and to then adapt it to include ethnic (Caribbean Latino) specific food choices related to bone health. Few theory-based interventions have targeted both dietary and physical activity behaviors to promote bone health and none that we know of have focused on overall dietary quality or on Caribbean origin Hispanic adults. This K01 award will provide Dr. Noel with training and research experience in bone health and osteoporosis prevention, health behavior theory, behavioral intervention design, implementation and evaluation, and advanced biostatistics. This training will help Dr. Noel achieve her long-term career goals of becoming a leading independent investigator in nutrition and bone health with expertise in designing and conducting culturally tailored behavioral interventions to improve bone health in diverse populations. Dr. Noel's mentors are highly committed to her career development and future success and will help her build additional knowledge and skills in bone health and intervention research. Dr. Noel's proposed research aims are to: 1) develop a bone-specific dietary quality index that emphasizes specific foods and nutrients known to be important for bone; and to evaluate the effects of a resulting dietary quality score on bone health using national survey data; 2) to adapt the index to include ethnic-specific food choices of Caribbean origin Hispanics, using data from an existing study of Puerto Rican adults, to guide the dietary component of a lifestyle behavior change intervention and; 3) to adapt and pilot test the feasibility and preliminary impact of a theory-based cultural and literacy-tailored intervention to improve dietary and physical activity behaviors among 60 Caribbean origin Hispanic adults. This bone-focused intervention will be modeled after another unique behavioral intervention, which successfully improved dietary quality and other health behaviors in low-income Caribbean Latinos. Innovative strategies, including narrative forms of communication, will be employed to help individuals adopt healthy behaviors. This work will inform a larger scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the behavioral intervention on bone outcomes in Caribbean Hispanics. This has the potential to have significant public health implications for improving bone health and preventing osteoporosis in high-risk, underserved ethnic minority populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoporosis is an increasing health concern among U.S. Hispanic adults.

"Improving Nutritional Choices in Adolescents PROJECT SUMMARY  Excess weight is a public health priority for all sectors of the US population and particularly for Black adolescents who have a disproportionately high prevalence of obesity and overweight. Research suggests that consumption of fast food and calorie dense foods prepared outside of the home contribute to a higher body mass index. Black youth are more likely than their White peers to live in low-income communities with a high density of fast food restaurants. There is a need for interventions to help adolescents make healthy choices in these obesogenic environments.  Our clinical work in the Michigan Pediatric Outpatient Weight Evaluation and Reduction (MPOWER) program suggests that adolescents find it difficult to make healthy choices in obesogenic settings, such as fast food restaurants. From our initial MPOWERed Messages study, we found that adolescents welcomed health- related text messages (based on Self Determination Theory and Motivational Interviewing) if they viewed them as personally relevant and if they were received at times when they faced dietary choices. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that delivering messages (tailored to users’ preferences and values) at a time and place when they are making a dietary choice (e.g., in a restaurant) would positively influence their selection.  In a first step toward exploring this, we combined our experience in the development of tailored texts for adolescents, with state-of-the-art geo-fencing technology, to develop the Location Initiated Individualized Texts for African American Adolescent Health (LIITA3H) mobile application. This app a) accurately identified when users were in an eating venue such as a restaurant, b) automatically sent culturally relevant messages (based on focus group input from the target population) tailored to user preferences and the menu options at their location with the aim of prompting users to make a healthy choice, and c) allowed users to submit an annotated photo of their food choice. This study demonstrated the app’s acceptability and feasibility, and the accuracy of the technology to deliver tailored messages at the point of purchase. However, we did not pilot test whether receipt of these ‘just in time’ personalized messages, actually influenced participants’ food choices.  This R21 project will focus on 1) enhancing the LIITA3H app by incorporating user input regarding its design and by allowing greater automation in the identification of eating venues, and 2) pilot testing the impact of the app on the number of calories purchased from, and number of visits to, fast food restaurants. This will provide data regarding effect size, and will form the foundation for planning a future randomized trial which would include a larger population and a greater range of eating venues. A better understanding of how receipt of ‘just in time” tailored messages, made possible by new location-based technology, alters behavior among a high risk population, will help future efforts to address obesity and other illnesses impacted by lifestyle choices. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this R21 project is to examine whether the LIITA3H mobile application (designed by the research team as part of a R41 study), by acting at the point of purchase, helps Black adolescents purchase fewer calories from, and make fewer visits to, fast food restaurants. In this study the app, which uses location based technology to identify when a user is in an eating venue, and then delivers culturally and individually tailored messages to prompt healthy choices, will be enhanced and pilot tested. By using ‘just-in-time’ cues to action to help adolescents make healthy choices in obesogenic settings such as fast food restaurants, the app will promote the achievement of a healthy weight and a reduction in weight-related illnesses.",Improving Nutritional Choices in Adolescents,9430771,R21HD093835,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Automation ', ' Behavior ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cues ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Libraries ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Marketing ', ' Michigan ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Self Determination ', ' Societies ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Calories ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' tailored messaging ', ' group intervention ', ' obesigenic ', ' obesogenic ', ' public health priorities ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' healthy weight ', ' adolescent health ', ' ethnic identity ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' lower income families ', ' Text Messaging ', ' weight loss programming ', ' weight loss program ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2018,233125,0.077448541263316
"Understanding & Overcoming Food Insecurity in Diabetes Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food insecurity, defined as difficulty affording an adequate diet owing to cost, affects over 20% of the 29 million Americans with diabetes. Food insecurity is an important socioeconomic barrier to effective diabetes care: it is associated with worse diabetes control and increased emergency department visits and hospitalization. By incentivizing consumption of calorie-dense foods high in simple carbohydrates and saturated fats, instead of more expensive fresh produce and whole grains, food insecurity may undermine healthy diets that are crucial for diabetes management. This project will help advance our knowledge of the relationship between food insecurity and diabetes by identifying how food insecurity affects current diabetes management and examining the clinical effects of using different strategies to overcome it. Fundamental questions regarding the mechanisms underlying potential interventions remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To determine the impact of food insecurity on a lifestyle change intervention: the REAL HEALTH Diabetes trial (R18 DK102737 NCT02320253), a pragmatic adaptation of the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention to community health centers, 2)To estimate the effect of nutrition assistance program use on diabetes control for patients in a primary care network, and 3) To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility of home-delivered medically tailored meals for food insecure diabetes patients with hyperglycemia. This research program complements the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' strategic focus on translating clinical research to practice by overcoming barriers faced by patients in real-world settings, reducing disparities in special populations, making care more patient-centered, and innovating within systems of care. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in understanding how socioeconomic barriers affect diabetes management and pragmatic interventions to overcome them. Career development activities include training in advanced analytic methods and intervention design through formal coursework as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will fill important knowledge gaps, and help improve diabetes management and reduce diabetes complications in patients with food insecurity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Over 29 million Americans have diabetes, and 1 in 5, nearly 6 million, report food insecurity, or difficulty accessing nutritious food owing to cost. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of the role food insecurity plays in diabetes management, and assess 2 strategies to address food insecurity in diabetes patients: 1) improving food access using nutritional assistance programs, and 2) directly providing medically tailored meals.

"A large-scale, long-term, randomized trial of nutrition labeling interventions PROJECT SUMMARY Poor dietary habits are associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. Government and institutional policy makers worldwide are interested in food labeling and messaging as a cost-effective strategy to encourage healthier food choices. Although there is evidence that nutrition labels can influence behavior, it is unclear which label designs are most effective at altering behavior for people with different levels of education. There are three common types of nutrition labels: a single logo highlighting healthier choices, traffic light labels, or physical activity labels that translate calorie information into exercise required to burn off the calories. Because there have been no large-scale, long-term randomized trials comparing the effect of these labels on behavior, the relative impact of these labeling schemes is unknown. Such rigorous evaluations are needed so policy makers do not have to guess. The overall objective of this application is to compare four theoretically-informed nutrition label designs in the first long-term, large-scale randomized trial of nutrition messages. The study will be conducted in partnership with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health which will enable us to randomize 267 (107 snack and 160 beverage) vending machines to different nutrition label messages. Beverage machines will be randomized to one of the following four conditions: 1) A single green traffic light label next to items meeting a “healthy” threshold; 2) a multiple traffic light label that displays red, yellow, or green labels to indicate options that range from less to more healthy; 3) a physical activity label that indicates the number of minutes one would have to walk to burn off the calories in each food or beverage; or 4) tax-related messaging (Philadelphia implemented a 1.5 cents per ounce beverage tax in January 2017). Snack machines will be randomized to the same conditions except for the tax messaging, which does not apply to foods. We will use vending machine transaction data over three years to compare the influence each label has on average calories and percentage of healthy and less healthy items purchased as well as impact on sales. We will also conduct interviews with 2,916 vending machine patrons to evaluate whether education level and other factors moderate message influence. This study will provide valuable data to fill research gaps and inform policy makers’ efforts to use nutrition labeling and messaging as a public health approach to encourage healthier choices and address health disparities. !

"Testing combinations of population interventions to encourage healthy eating ABSTRACT Population-level interventions to encourage healthy eating—which involve changing food environments or purchasing conditions—have been extensively discussed for the prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Preliminary data suggest that population interventions introduced in isolation (such as an SSB tax) can have a modest effect, but multi-faceted interventions should be introduced in combination, to produce large and meaningful improvements in healthy eating. Studying combinations of population interventions is difficult, as such interventions are rare. We propose to rigorously assess a rare set of nested natural experiments in the two largest, most diverse urban settings in California (CA): Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. We will identify the complementarities among major population-level interventions to encourage healthy eating. In Aim 1, we will conduct a prospective evaluation of a population-wide SSB tax in both tax-affected and matched unaffected CA counties. We will identify changes to both beverage and food consumption and purchasing, food substitution patterns, spillover to neighboring areas, effects of marketing, and any regressive economic effects for low-income populations. The longer-term follow-up period enabled by our design will test the hypothesis that a SSB tax produces sustained declines in SSB consumption rather than merely short-term effects followed by a return to pre-tax consumption. Uniquely, we will then test complementarity between the tax and other interventions in Aims 2 and 3. In Aim 2, we will examine the complementarity of the SSB tax with a fruit and vegetable voucher program. Some SSB tax-affected and distant tax-unaffected counties have introduced fresh fruit and vegetable purchasing vouchers, which enable low-income families facing food insecurity to purchase fruits and vegetables at major supermarkets and corner stores in the area, not just at farmer’s markets. We will test the hypothesis, supported by our preliminary data, that pairing the purchasing penalty of an SSB tax with a purchasing incentive of a fruit and vegetable voucher improves upon the modest effect of either intervention alone. In Aim 3, we will identify the complementarity between the SSB tax and a workplace SSB purchasing ban, implemented in some workplaces but not others during tax-affected and -unaffected periods. We will test the hypothesis, consistent with our preliminary data, that workplace bans disproportionately reduce SSB consumption in the lowest-income employees, neutralizing the economically-regressive effect of a SSB tax. We will evaluate these interventions using innovative methods that advance the study of natural experiments in obesity and diabetes prevention. Specifically, we will use a synthetic control statistical method, which adjusts for unmeasured confounders such as differences in culture among the intervention and control areas. Second, we will input our results into validated computer simulation models of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, allowing us to project the generalizable impact and cost-effectiveness of the interventions for reducing long-term national race/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Population-level interventions to encourage healthy eating—which often involve changing food environments or purchasing conditions—have been extensively discussed for the prevention of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Current theory suggests that to significantly reduce such diseases at a population level, multi-faceted interventions should be introduced in combination, but such combinations are challenging to study given their rarity. We propose to rigorously assess multiple natural experiments in well-matched populations, fulfilling a strategic NIH goal to understand what interventions in combination can lead to population-wide reductions in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.",Testing combinations of population interventions to encourage healthy eating,9497699,R01DK116852,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Beverages ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Demography ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incentives ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Sales ', ' San Francisco ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Workplace ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' Calories ', ' Frequencies ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Supermarket ', ' Employee ', ' novel ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' theories ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Intake ', ' Population Intervention ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' food consumption ', ' obesity prevention ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' food environment ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' lower income families ', ' farmers markets ', ' urban setting ', ' ']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,736570,0.12057095732386269
"Impact of Navajo Nation Tax on Junk Food 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  2 The Navajo Epidemiology Center manages Navajo public health information systems, and  3 provides data and reports that inform health programming for the over 330,000 enrolled  4 members of the Navajo tribe. Their reports have documented high prevalence of diabetes  5 and obesity, limited availability of healthy traditional foods, and high rates of consumption of  6 sugar sweetened beverages. To address these issues and its consequences, the Navajo  7 Nation passed the Healthy Diné Nation Act (HDNA) in November 2014. The law includes a  8 2% tax on foods of little-to-no-nutritional value (‘junk foods’), the first-ever such tax in the  9 United States. Revenues from the tax are distributed annually to each of the 110 local 10 government entities (chapters) to develop and support local wellness projects. The law was 11 passed with the expectation that the increased cost would impact the food environment, lead 12 to reduced consumption of junk foods and provide a sustainable source of funds to support 13 local needs for wellness programming. 14 To date, however, a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the tax has not been 15 completed. Therefore, the research team, consisting of the Navajo Epidemiology Center, 16 Northern Arizona University and Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital local community 17 affiliate propose to study the impact of the tax on 3 major components: 1) chapter wellness 18 programming supported by tax revenue, 2) changes in the food store environment and 19 pricing following the tax implementation; and 3) changes in sugar sweetened beverage and 20 fruit/vegetable intake following the tax implementation. Chapter wellness programming will be 21 assessed via data from the Division of Community Development, who are supportive of the 22 project. Changes in the food store environment will be assessed via a follow-up of a 2013 23 (pre-tax) survey of 83 stores across the Navajo Nation, which will also identify positive 24 outliers in terms of changes in healthy food offerings. Consumption behaviors will be 25 assessed by conducting a follow-up of the unique Navajo BRFSS, which is a population wide 26 survey following rigorous BRFSS methods. The team has active Navajo IRB protocols to 27 support each aim, and have collaborative support from key stakeholders, positioning us well 28 to deliver on the proposed aims. It is our belief that information from this study is timely, 29 urgent and will be essential for the Navajo Nation leadership to make an informed decision 30 about the continuation of the junk food tax. Project Narrative To address substantial health disparities among the Navajo people, the Navajo Nation passed the 2014 Healthy Diné Nation Act (HDNA), which includes a 2% tax on junk foods. This proposal aims to assess the impact of the junk food tax by utilizing several high quality and culturally specific data sources developed by the Navajo Epidemiology Center. Specifically, we will summarize chapter wellness programming supported by tax revenue, assess changes in the food store environment and behaviors including consumption of sugar- sweetened beverages, fruit and vegetables.",Impact of Navajo Nation Tax on Junk Food,9607861,R01MD013352,"['Arizona ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Government ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Hospitals ', ' Laws ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Methods ', ' Local Government ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Taxation ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' sugar ', ' Data Quality ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Navajo ', ' Navaho ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' authority ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Health Information System ', ' member ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Intake ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' cost ', ' consumer demand ', ' tribal Nation ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' food environment ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' Diné ', ' Diné Nation ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,454320,0.26684733529078203
"Impact of Racially Targeted Food and Beverage Ads on Adolescent Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and diabetes pose significant and costly threats to public health in the United States. Food and beverage marketing has been identified as a major driver of obesity and diabetes, with the majority of advertisements promoting sugary beverages and energy-dense, nutrient-poor food products. Studies show children exposed to food advertisements are more likely to request the advertised food, express preference for the advertised food, and consume more food. Adolescents also represent a key target for marketers because of their buying power and influence over parent purchases. African American and Hispanic adolescents are especially highly targeted consumers because they are perceived by marketers to be ""cultural trendsetters."" Adolescents are exposed to food and beverage advertisements through traditional forms of media, and increasingly, through digital media and social networking websites. To assess how exposure to racially-targeted food and beverage advertisements affects adolescents' food choices and perceptions of products, this study will examine adolescents' ratings of advertisements and featured products, and how exposure to advertisements affects dietary choices. Data collection will occur online through Survey Sampling International's database of participants (Aim 1 and 2, outcomes are ratings of advertisements and willingness to engage in marketing promotions) and through community organizations that serve adolescents (Aim 3, outcomes are advertising ratings and actual food choices). Subjects will be male and female adolescents ages 12-17 years who identify as African American, Hispanic, or White, and a subset of the participants will speak Spanish and English. These data will capture how racially-targeted advertisements affect adolescents' food and beverage choices and perceptions of food and beverage products. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is one of the most complex and costly public health problems in the United States, and food marketing has been identified as a significant driver of obesity.

"Water, Food, and the Triple Burden of Disease in the Galapagos, Ecuador Project Summary/Abstract Rapid social and environmental development in low and middle income countries (LMIC) has contributed to the increasing prevalence of obesity and cardiometabolic disease in children and adults. Changes in diet, however, have outpaced water and sanitation improvements, contributing to a dual burden of overweight/noncommunicable disease (OWT/NCD) and persistent undernutrition and infectious disease (UND/ID) within individuals and households. Disentangling the biological, social and environmental pathways leading to the dual burden of disease is particularly critical in LMIC, like Ecuador, where economic development has been rapid and accompanied by dramatic shifts in diet, disease burden and lifestyle. Yet, little work has examined the independent and joint impact of water and food access, quality and security on the development of OWT/NCD and UND/ID or how psychological distress (PD) associated with insecure access to clean water and market foods may mediate the dual burden at the household level. Our team will fill this gap. We will capitalize on secondary analysis of an existing dataset, the nationally-representative Encuensta National de Salud and Nutricion-Ecuador 2012 (Ensanut) and the existing partnership between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Universidad San Francisco Quito (USFQ) on the Galapagos Islands to guide an exploratory, in-depth survey of 125 urban and rural households. We will incorporate biological, ecological, spatial, and survey data, to 1) examine the socioeconomic and development factors associated with household water access and diet quality, 2) test the pathways linking water and food access, quality, and security to the dual burden of OWT/NCD and UND/ID, and 3) examine whether PD mediates these pathways at the individual and household-levels. Our results will advance knowledge by: 1) describing the burden of disease in this model LMIC setting, 2) documenting the pathways linking water and food exposures to the dual burden and 3) showing how PD may contribute to UND/ID and OWT/NCD at the household-level, creating a triple burden of disease. The Galapagos Islands provide a unique opportunity to study the impact of the environmental and social changes facing LMICs impacted by migration, urbanization and shifting diet and disease burdens within a relatively closed ecosystem. Our secondary data analysis and primary data collection will inform an R01 that will scale up our novel measures (water security, water quality, and PD) to more widely examine the triple burden of disease in Ecuador. This R21 will capitalize upon an existing relationship between UNC and USFQ, build our collaborative research capacity, provide training in statistical and biomarker analysis to LMIC researchers, and improve the research infrastructure in Ecuador to permit the development of an expanded R01 project to address important health research needs and identify avenues for intervention. Project Narrative: In LMIC, increasing obesity and cardiometabolic disease exist alongside persistent undernutrition and infectious disease morbidity due to the heterogeneity in diets, lifestyles, and disease burdens that accompany economic development. An improved understanding of the pathways linking the water and food exposures to the dual burden of under- and over-nutrition is critical for identifying the effects of changing environments on human health and developing successful interventions for reducing the global burden of obesity, cardiometabolic disease and persistent undernutiriton.  ","Water, Food, and the Triple Burden of Disease in the Galapagos, Ecuador",9572456,R21TW010832,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Anxiety ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economic Development ', ' Economical Development ', ' Economics ', ' Ecuador ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Galapagos Islands ', ' Geography ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Health ', ' Hemoglobin C ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Island ', ' Joints ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lipids ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' North Carolina ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' rural-urban migration ', ' rural to urban migration ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sanitation ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Urbanization ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Malnutrition ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Inequality ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Height ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' water quality ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' social ', ' reproductive ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' water testing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Collection ', ' Security ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' environmental change ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Food Access ', ' scale up ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' effective intervention ', ' successful intervention ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' secondary analysis ', ' rural households ', ' rural residence ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' ']",FIC,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2018,162393,0.1724582131638864
"Community-Based Dietary Approach for Hypertensive African Americans with Chronic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) when compared to whites. Racial disparities are most profound among persons of low socioeconomic status (SES) and dietary factors likely underlie much of this disparity. Low SES AAs are more likely to experience food insecurity and live in “food deserts” and are less likely to follow a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordant diet than are whites. This is despite evidence that adherence to the DASH diet may have greater blood pressure benefit for AAs than whites, and evidence that the DASH diet may slow CKD progression (including reductions in urine albumin excretion). We propose to build upon encouraging results of our pilot study, “The Five-Plus Nuts and Beans Trial”, which was conducted as a partnership between Johns Hopkins investigators, a community supermarket, the Baltimore City Health Department’s “Virtual Supermarket” program, a community-based clinic and a highly engaged Community Advisory Board. This randomized trial tested the effects of a dietary approach to increase consumption of a central feature of the DASH diet--high potassium foods. A total of 123 AA patients with controlled hypertension, and recruited from a community-based clinic, were provided personalized dietary advice, assistance with grocery ordering and delivery, and $30 per week worth of high potassium foods for an 8-week period. With this approach, we demonstrated statistically significant increases in consumption of fruits, vegetables, potassium, magnesium and fiber, and decreases in sodium intake. Also, there was a 14% reduction in urinary albumin excretion overall, and a 30% reduction among patients with significant albuminuria at enrollment.  In this application, we propose a larger (n=150) and longer (1 year) trial of a dietary intervention in AAs with hypertension (controlled or uncontrolled) plus mild/moderate CKD—a population at very high risk of the adverse effects of poor diets. The primary aim, in the setting of a randomized trial, is to test the hypothesis that delivery of nutritional advice to adopt the DASH diet and $30 per week worth of potassium-rich foods, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores of patients recruited from community-based clinics, will reduce blood pressure and reduce urinary albumin excretion in low SES AAs with hypertension and CKD. Strengths of our proposal include the integration of an experienced, highly collaborative team of investigators with expertise in clinical trials, nephrology, health disparities, community-based participatory research, integration of trials into primary care practices, and statistical analyses. The investigation team includes a highly involved Community Advisory Board, and has an established close partnership with Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, the Baltimore City Health Department and local supermarkets. If our hypothesis is correct, then our trial will establish an immediately translatable, inexpensive, and safe approach for adjuvant therapy in the treatment of hypertension and kidney damage (albuminuria) among low SES AAs. PROJECT NARRATIVE  African Americans are disproportionately affected by hypertension and kidney disease in the United States, and these disparities are particularly apparent among socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans. Limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy diets likely contribute to these disparities. In this community-based randomized clinical trial, we will test whether delivering nutritional advice to adopt the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and $30 per week worth of fruits and vegetables, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores, will reduce blood pressure and kidney damage in socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans with

"Impact of a Local Staple Food Ordinance on Food Choice and Calories Purchased DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this R01 is to evaluate the impact of a local policy change (i.e., the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance) that establishes minimum stocking criteria for a wide array of healthy foods as a requirement of food store licensing. Recent calls to action from the Institute of Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other authorities have identified improving access to healthy foods as a primary strategy for local governments to use in advancing obesity prevention efforts, but policy initiatives in this area have been limited. In this R01, the impact of the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance will be evaluated by assessing objectively measured changes in: (a) food environments among small, urban food stores, including availability, promotion, advertising, quality, price, and placement of both healthy and unhealthy foods and beverages, (b) nutritional quality of consumer purchases at small food stores, including assessment of energy density and calories via customer intercept surveys and direct observation of purchases and (c) home food environments, including availability of healthy and unhealthy foods/beverages and an overall home food obesogenicity score, among households that frequently shop at small stores. These changes will be assessed pre-policy implementation, as well as 4-, 12- and 24-months post-policy implementation, in two Minnesota cities: Minneapolis and St. Paul, (our control community). The proposed scope of work in this R01 is important because its takes advantage of a unique opportunity to evaluate an innovative local policy addressing a recommended action area for obesity prevention that aligns with key recommendations by leading obesity prevention authorities. To our knowledge, the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance is the only policy of its kind in the US, and as such it could serve as an important model policy for other local governments if it is successful.

"A Systems Science Approach to Understanding Racial/Ethnic Dispartities in Obesity ABSTRACT Identifying effective strategies for reducing obesity is critical for alleviating the unequal burden of obesity and related adverse cardiopulmonary and sleep outcomes facing black and Hispanic women in the U.S. Studies typically focus on identifying independent effects of individual and environmental factors on obesity, but this approach overlooks important inter-relationships between these factors. This is challenging to model using traditional regression modeling approaches which are not well equipped to handle the complex ways individuals interact with their environments. Systems science approaches were promoted in two recent reports released by the Institute of Medicine and are part of the NHLBI Strategic Research Priorities because predictive and simulation-based models can both elucidate the complex inter-relationships between social, economic, and environmental causes of poor health and assess the benefits and harms of policy and intervention options. Thus, the overall goal of this application is to use a systems science methodology, agent- based modeling, to understand how individual-level behaviors and psychosocial factors interact with characteristics of the food environment to influence eating behaviors and obesity. This goal will be accomplished by executing the following aims: 1) to examine associations of food store characteristics with body mass index among Hispanic, black and white women; 2) to develop an exploratory agent-based model that simulates the emergence of racial/ethnic disparities in obesity among women; and 3) to investigate the effectiveness of potential multi-level interventions to reduce obesity. The candidate, Kiarri Kershaw, is an Assistant Professor of Preventive Medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Her strong training in general epidemiology, social epidemiology, and population health has allowed her to pursue a research agenda focused on racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and place-based disparities in cardiovascular disease risk factors. The K01 award will allow her to build on her current training by providing her with protected time to collect data on factors that influence lifestyle choices and to build and test an initial agent- based simulation. It will also allow her to learn how to work with community stakeholders and policymakers in order to develop research studies with a greater potential to translate into public health improvements. This training will help Dr. Kershaw achieve her long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program that focuses on how inter-relationships between individuals and their environments influence disparities in CVD risk. RELEVANCE: The results of this research project and future studies will allow for the development of effective, comprehensive multi-level interventions to promote cardiovascular health by reducing racial/ethnic disparities in obesity. Specifically, the execution of these aims will lead to an improved understanding of the dynamic inter-relationships between individuals and their environments that contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in eating behaviors and obesity.",A Systems Science Approach to Understanding Racial/Ethnic Dispartities in Obesity,9486002,K01HL133531,"['Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Local Government ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' tool ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' Physical environment ', ' professor ', ' Nutrient ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' systematic review ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population health ', ' food environment ', ' public health intervention ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Data Analytics ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2018,133747,0.04161319743019387
"Community-Based Dietary Approach for Hypertensive African Americans with Chronic Kidney Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) when compared to whites. Racial disparities are most profound among persons of low socioeconomic status (SES) and dietary factors likely underlie much of this disparity. Low SES AAs are more likely to experience food insecurity and live in ""food deserts"" and are less likely to follow a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordant diet than are whites. This is despite evidence that adherence to the DASH diet may have greater blood pressure benefit for AAs than whites, and evidence that the DASH diet may slow CKD progression (including reductions in urine albumin excretion). We propose to build upon encouraging results of our pilot study, ""The Five-Plus Nuts and Beans Trial"", which was conducted as a partnership between Johns Hopkins investigators, a community supermarket, the Baltimore City Health Department's ""Virtual Supermarket"" program, a community-based clinic and a highly engaged Community Advisory Board. This randomized trial tested the effects of a dietary approach to increase consumption of a central feature of the DASH diet--high potassium foods. A total of 123 AA patients with controlled hypertension, and recruited from a community-based clinic, were provided personalized dietary advice, assistance with grocery ordering and delivery, and $30 per week worth of high potassium foods for an 8-week period. With this approach, we demonstrated statistically significant increases in consumption of fruits, vegetables, potassium, magnesium and fiber, and decreases in sodium intake. Also, there was a 14% reduction in urinary albumin excretion overall, and a 30% reduction among patients with significant albuminuria at enrollment. In this application, we propose a larger (n=150) and longer (1 year) trial of a dietary intervention in AAs with hypertension (controlled or uncontrolled) plus mild/moderate CKD-a population at very high risk of the adverse effects of poor diets. The primary aim, in the setting of a randomized trial, is to test the hypothesis that delivery of nutritional advice to adopt the DASH diet and $30 per week worth of potassium-rich foods, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores of patients recruited from community-based clinics, will reduce blood pressure and reduce urinary albumin excretion in low SES AAs with hypertension and CKD. Strengths of our proposal include the integration of an experienced, highly collaborative team of investigators with expertise in clinical trials, nephrology, health disparities, community-based participatory research, integration of trials into primary care practices, and statistical analyses The investigation team includes a highly involved Community Advisory Board, and has an established close partnership with Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, the Baltimore City Health Department and local supermarkets. If our hypothesis is correct, then our trial will establish an immediately translatable, inexpensive, and safe approach for adjuvant therapy in the treatment of hypertension and kidney damage (albuminuria) among low SES AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are disproportionately affected by hypertension and kidney disease in the United States, and these disparities are particularly apparent among socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans. Limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy diets likely contribute to these disparities. In this community-based randomized clinical trial, we will test whether delivering nutritional advice to adopt the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and $30 per week worth of fruits and vegetables, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores, will reduce blood pressure and kidney damage in socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans with

"Effectiveness and Implementation of a Research Tested Mobile Produce Market Designed to Improve Diet in Underserved Communities Abstract Lower-income and minority groups face significant health disparities with respect to obesity, cancer, heart disease and other diet-related chronic conditions. Poor diets, low in fruits and vegetables (F&V) and high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar, contribute to many of the health problems faced by vulnerable groups. While socioeconomic status and other individual level factors (i.e., food preferences, time and skills to prepare healthy food, etc.) can lead to reduced F&V consumption, these must be viewed in an environmental context. Compared with higher-income neighborhoods, lower-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to have stores that sell a variety of F&V and other healthy foods. And when stores are available, produce may not be affordable, high quality or culturally appropriate. Farmers' markets and mobile produce markets (MM) have become increasingly popular strategies to alleviate food access concerns in underserved communities. However, it is unclear if these programs have the necessary components to have an appreciable impact on diet. Our research team recently completed one of the first randomized controlled trials of a MM program called the Veggie Van. Veggie Van was run in partnership with our team and a small non-profit organization in North Carolina; it delivered boxes of fresh, locally grown produce and food-focused education to communities with significant barriers to F&V consumption including availability, affordability, quality and knowledge. In this small cluster-randomized trial in 12 communities (N=201), we saw impressive changes in F&V intake with intervention participants eating almost 1 more cups per day of F&Vs than the control group. Intervention participants also reported increases in perceived access to healthy foods and Veggie Van customers attributed many dietary changes to the MM program. While these results are very promising, we believe it is important to test the effectiveness of the Veggie Van program when implemented by different organizations in multiple communities. If shown to be effective, we can create a research-tested intervention toolkit which can be disseminated to communities across the country. For this research, we will use a request for proposals process to identify 8 organizations nationwide that are well-qualified to implement the Veggie Van model. Organizations will identify appropriate sites for MM deliveries (32 total) and we will randomize them to either an implementation or planning condition. With the help of our team's technical assistance and provided funding, partner organizations will engage community members in the process and initiate a MM program. We will use a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation to measure effectiveness (diet, BMI, dermal carotenoids) and implementation (customer reach and sales, process measures, qualitative interviews with MM staff). We will also examine sustainability of MM financial models and determine implementation standards (i.e., dose needed to maintain impact) for inclusion in our MM toolkit for future dissemination. Narrative Our research demonstrated that a mobile produce market can have a significant positive impact on diets of residents in lower-income communities. We want to test this program more widely to determine if the effect can be replicated and develop a best-practices toolkit to help others sustainably implement the program.",Effectiveness and Implementation of a Research Tested Mobile Produce Market Designed to Improve Diet in Underserved Communities,9447402,R37CA215232,"['Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carotenoids ', ' carotenoid biosynthesis ', ' Carotenes and Carotenoids ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Feedback ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fingers ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Preferences ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Housing ', ' Hybrids ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Marketing ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' North Carolina ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Sales ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Businesses ', ' Process Measure ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' diet education ', ' nutrition education ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Dermal ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Measurement ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' cooking ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Height ', ' community college ', ' two year college ', ' junior college ', ' 2 year college ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Intake ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Update ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' informant ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' environmental intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' food environment ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' farmers markets ', ' recruit ', ' intervention participants ', ' ']",NCI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R37,2018,655400,0.14230308074101566
"Appalachians Together Restoring the Eating Environment (Appal-TREE): Advancing Sustainable CBPR Interventions to Improve Healthy Diet in Rural Appalachian Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The National Institutes of Health has acknowledged that residents of rural Appalachia experience among the nation's worst health and economic profiles, including disability and premature mortality stemming from elevated rates of heart disease and stroke, various cancers, diabetes, all of which are closely associated with suboptimal dietary intake, obesity, and overweight. Community members are particularly concerned about their children, who have among the highest rates of obesity, overweight, and suboptimal dietary intake in the nation. Eliminating these health disparities requires scientificaly informed community-engaged research to develop and evaluate innovative and sustainable programs and policies. For the proposed application, our community-research team will (1) use an innovative information technology CBPR method - Structured Public Involvement - to refine and tailor a package of pilot tested healthy eating interventions; (2) conduct and evaluate this package of interventions that were found to be feasible, culturally consonant, and promising during R24MD008018 and (3) build community capacity in social marketing, an innovative approach to enhance sustainability of the intervention. Our partners include the Community Farm Alliance, local school districts, the Cooperative Extension Service, and other community organizations. For the first aim, the innovative CBPR approach Structured Public Involvement will allow us to tailor the intervention while maintaining project fidelity. For the second aim, we will administer and evaluate three interrelated interventions to transform access to and intake of healthy foods for Appalachian children; (1) a school-based water campaign to decrease sugar sweetened beverage consumption (2) healthy cooking classes to encourage healthy cooking on a budget; and (3).a farmer's market-based healthy summer feeding program. Finally, in Aim 3, we will administer a CBPR-oriented approach, social marketing, to enhance sustainability, a challenge for all behavioral interventions. Through the schools, we will train teachers and administrators to teach social marketing to students, who will be encouraged to develop marketing campaigns supporting healthy diets. All of these efforts will be developed, implemented, and evaluated in conjunction with our Community Advisory Boards. As one of our local stakeholders told us, ""If you really are what you eat, it's no wonder so many of us are unhealthy."" By developing sustainable, evidence-based programming, we aim to transform consumption patterns and the eating environment so the next generation of rural residents can overcome pernicious health disparities.

"FOOD (Food to Overcome Outcomes Disparities) Project Summary The World Health Organization defines food security as having access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life. Food security includes both physical and economic access to food that meets people's dietary needs and preferences. The 18-item, 12-month time-referenced U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module (USDA) categorizes individuals as having high food security, marginal food security, low food security, or very low food security. Food insecurity is growing in the U.S., with an overall prevalence of 12.7% (low and very low food security). The prevalence of food insecurity among immigrant and minority communities exceeds the national average. Food insecurity is associated with non-adherence to treatment. Food-insecure patients are more likely to postpone care and often cannot afford prescribed medication(s). Food-insecure patients have significantly higher levels of nutritional risk, depression, financial strain, and lower quality of life. Nutrition interventions result in enhanced quality of life. Cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to both food insecurity and its impact, due to the intensity of treatment protocols and the disease process itself. A study among a cohort of underserved cancer patients in New York City showed that 56% were food insecure, with 38% of the cohort with very low food security. Treatment adherence is an important determinant of survival among cancer patients. However, among ethnic minority cancer patients, unmet socioeconomic and supportive care needs are associated with patient-reported missed radiation, and/or chemotherapy appointments. Food insecurity potentially acts as a mediating factor, as functional, social, and emotional well-being decrease significantly with increasing food insecurity. Prior to our work, there had been only one study examining food insecurity in cancer patients. There is to date no evidence base on interventions to address food insecurity, and their potential to ameliorate cancer and other chronic disease treatment completion disparities. Food to Overcome Outcomes Disparities (FOOD) addresses this gap as the first large study of its kind to examine food interventions in vulnerable populations and their impact on breast cancer treatment completion. Results have the potential to guide program and policy change. FOOD will utilize a three arm randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of a hospital-based medically tailored food pantry (Pantry) versus a food voucher program (Voucher) versus a home grocery delivery program (Delivery) on cancer treatment completion. FOOD is a partnership between the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) Immigrant Health and Cancer Disparities (IHCD) Service, the Food Bank for New York City, the New York City Council, the New York City Health and Hospitals, God's Love We Deliver, and Saint Barnabas Hospital. This study builds upon the foundation laid by a seminal pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial, which examined a scalable, clinic-based food pantry, a food voucher program, and home grocery delivery. Project Narrative This is the first study to address the impact of food insecurity among the growing underserved, and immigrant and minority, breast cancer patient population in active treatment for cure. The FOOD study builds upon the team's unique approaches to addressing and studying food insecurity and cancer treatment completion, including implementing food pantries co-located within oncology clinics and studying the impact of a pilot food voucher program and a home grocery delivery program. FOOD has the potential to significantly improve the growing issues of food insecurity and barriers to emergency food resources that hamper breast cancer treatment completion among medically underserved populations in New York City, and across the nation in large metropolitan areas.",FOOD (Food to Overcome Outcomes Disparities),9577557,R01CA230446,"['Appointment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Kentucky ', ' Love ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' food resource ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Saints ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Depression screen ', ' depression screening ', ' Radiation ', ' voucher ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Intake ', ' Interruption ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' MSKCC ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Seminal ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' active method ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' food security ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' chemotherapy ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' symptom improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' treatment adherence ', ' arm ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' minority communities ', ' intervention cost ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2018,709294,0.3032878878098982
"Population-level interventions and community environment effects on child obesity disparities Background and significance: Obesity rates remain high, despite nationwide declines and plateaus in the overall prevalence of obesity among some groups. Crucially, Black and Latino children have higher obesity rates than non-Hispanic Whites (hereafter “disparities”). Effective strategies to reduce child obesity and disparities could significantly contribute to population health improvements and reductions in racial/ethnic health disparities. Nutrition policies—those that regulate the nutritional content of foods and beverages in schools, including the so-called “competitive” foods because they are sold separately from school meals— could play a key role in the primary prevention of obesity and related chronic diseases. The effect of nutrition policies however, can be strengthened or weakened by the community food environment near schools (e.g., through children’s access, purchases and consumption of unhealthy foods). No studies have yet examined the combined influences of multiple nutrition policies and community food environments on child obesity and disparities. Objectives: This quasi-experimental study is responsive to the NIH Obesity Strategic Plan and proposes to: (1) determine the obesity effects of the California nutrition policy improving and limiting access to “competitive” foods/beverages together with the recent federal policy to improve school meal nutrition standards; and (2) investigate whether community food environments modify the effect nutrition policies on obesity and related disparities. Innovation. The study: (a) improves causal inferences about the effects of nutrition policies on obesity and disparities using rigorous, complementary methods (interrupted time series design, propensity scores, and latent class analysis, GIS); (b) simultaneously investigates the obesity effects of the nutrition policies and the surrounding school food environment; and (c) uses a longitudinal, robust (>16 million) population-based data containing objective individual-level BMI measures of diverse children (51% Latino, 6% Black, 33% White, 8% Asian) linked with the community food environments of all the public schools to which children attended in California from 2001 to 2017.  Public health relevance, influence on other research and expected results: Preventing obesity and eliminating health disparities are major public health goals in Healthy People 2020. This study has the potential to influence the fields of obesity prevention science, racial/ethnic health disparities, as well as nutrition policy and environmental strategies to improve overall child health. The results generated from this study will: (a) strengthen the evidence base by elucidating the causal effects of promising, large scale nutrition interventions on obesity and related disparities; (b) identify characteristics of nutrition environments near schools where such nutrition policies are most effective; and (c) illuminate environments (inside and/or near schools) where additional interventions are needed.

"Designing Food Voucher Programs to Reduce Disparities in Healthy Diets Abstract Improving diets through increased food and vegetable (F&V) consumption significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Programs increasing the accessibility and affordability of F&Vs among low-income Americans have been hindered by the food consumption cycle associated with poverty: the tendency to over-consume calories shortly after receiving funds at the beginning of each month, draining the budget for F&V purchases, or for all food purchases, by month's end. Increasing food assistance funding alone does not resolve this problem, but an emerging theory about dietary behavior suggests that providing funds for food in smaller installments distributed throughout the month will smooth the consumption cycle and improve healthy eating—counteracting the tendency to respond to lump sum, once-monthly funding installments by purchasing calorie-dense foods immediately after funds are received. The theory also suggests that funds targeted toward specific healthy foods (e.g., F&Vs) will improve diets more than untargeted funds, despite the in- convenience of utilizing targeted funds. Our preliminary data support both hypotheses, which we will rigorously test in a real-world setting by comparing alternative approaches for delivering food purchasing vouchers. We have established and tested the infrastructure to provide vouchers accepted by all major food stores (e.g., supermarkets, corner shops) in two low-income neighborhoods. Leveraging this innovative infrastructure, in Aim 1 we propose a randomized trial with a two-by-two factorial design, comparing $20 of vouchers valid for one month to four $5 vouchers each valid for a sequential week of the month (lump sum versus distributed funding), and comparing vouchers restricted to F&V purchases to vouchers redeemable for any food (targeted versus untargeted funding). Low-income adults (N=288) recruited through our community partners will be randomized to one of four 6-month interventions: monthly targeted, monthly untargeted, weekly targeted, or weekly untargeted vouchers. Participants will be assessed through efficient verbal 24-hour dietary recalls validated among low-literacy populations, to determine daily consumption of F&Vs and metrics of overall dietary quality at months 0, 6 and 12 (6 months after vouchers end). Additional surveys will identify moderators and mediators of dietary improvement. In Aim 2, we will calculate the cost-effectiveness of the voucher programs. Vouchers and other interventions that support healthy diets reduce population-level CVD disparities over the course of decades. Hence, the full costs and benefits of such interventions are not possible to directly observe through time-limited trials. Following recent NIH policy statements, we will overcome this problem by applying an innovative, validated microsimulation modeling approach—a systems science method that integrates trial results with comprehensive data on the effect of dietary changes on CVD risks and costs over the life course. We will identify which voucher delivery strategies cost-effectively reduce CVD disparities—addressing a key scientific uncertainty in healthy eating intervention research. Public health relevance This study tackles a stubborn scientific issue—how to design and implement cost-effective interventions to support healthy eating among low-income populations—in an effort to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities between low- and higher-income Americans. We will test two hypotheses: that increasing the fre- quency of food assistance but not the overall amount of the assistance, and targeting such assistance towards healthy fruits and vegetables, increases dietary quality in a manner that can cost-effectively reduce CVD dis- parities. Our test of both hypotheses is of potentially high impact and timely, as 1 in 7 Americans are currently enrolled in nutrition programs that use monthly, untargeted funding approaches, but program directors are considering new approaches to reduce disparities in healthy diets through program modifications.",Designing Food Voucher Programs to Reduce Disparities in Healthy Diets,9523180,R01HL132814,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Budgets ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Reducing diet ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vegetables ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' improved ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' good diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' meetings ', ' Supermarket ', ' American ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Sum ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Low Literacy Population ', ' Modification ', ' food consumption ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' federal poverty level ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' farmers markets ', ' recruit ', ' secondary end point ', ' secondary endpoint ', ' Unhealthy Diet ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,741617,0.17111252120019357
"Understanding the role of gender inequality and food insecurity on maternal and child health Project Summary/Abstract Career Goals: This is a resubmission of an application for a K01 Career Development Award in Population Research for Nadia Diamond-Smith, PhD, MSc, an Assistant Professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Her preliminary research focuses on maternal and child health in South Asia, specifically the role of gender inequality and food insecurity. In the short term, she aims to build on this work, investigating the effect of gender inequality and food insecurity on maternal and child health outcomes in newly married women in Nepal. In the long term, she aspires to conduct research that results in interventions that will improve gender inequality and food access, and ultimately improve maternal and child health outcomes for women across their life course, with a focus on the pre-conception period. The knowledge and experience she will gain from this K01 award will prepare her to compete for NICHD R01 funding to test the household level behavior change and food insecurity intervention to address household dynamics around women's empowerment and access to food and nutrition in Nepal developed in this proposal in a randomized intervention trial. Environment: The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) provides generous support for junior faculty. UCSF researchers have a long history of pursuing innovative ideas in reproductive health, studying food insecurity, and working in low and middle-income countries. Key Elements of Research Career Development Plan: Dr. Diamond-Smith has a strong background in public health (epidemiology and biostatistics) and demographic methods, with substantial experience analyzing large datasets and conducting qualitative data. This career development award will enable her to address several remaining gaps in her training specific to her career goals, and to gain applied experience planning and executing a primary data collection study on gender inequality and food insecurity, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. She seeks training in (1) maternal and child nutrition and food insecurity; (2) women's empowerment theory and measurement; and (3) implementation sciences, including designing behavioral interventions and evaluating interventions. To achieve these goals, Dr. Diamond-Smith has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team. It includes her Primary Mentor, Sheri Weiser, MD, MPH, in the School of Medicine at UCSF with a secondary appointment in Global Health Sciences at UCSF, who has extensive experience conducting research and developing interventions on food insecurity and health outcomes, and co-mentor Mallory Johnson, PhD, a Clinical Health Psychologist in UCSF's School of Medicine and an expert behavior change interventions and intervention design and evaluation. Her team includes three additional, complementary advisors: Cynthia Harper, PhD, in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at UCSF, with an expertise in demography and women's reproductive health and experience working in Nepal; Anita Raj, PhD, in the Division of Global Public Health, Department of Medicine, at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), with training in Developmental Psychology and extensive experience in South Asia on topics including sexual and reproductive health, maternal and child health, and gender based violence; and George W. Rutherford, MD, Vice Chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the School of Medicine at UCSF, with expertise in pediatric epidemiology and interventions to improve child health. Dr. Diamond-Smith's training will include a combination of structured reading lists and tutorials with mentors, coursework, workshops, conference presentations and attendance, and seminars. Description of the Research Project: Women and children in Nepal are especially vulnerable to malnutrition, which I hypothesize is due to pervasive gender inequality across women's life course combined with food insecurity at the individual and household level. I hypothesize that household dynamics around women's empowerment and access to food are especially crucial in the pre-conception period. The overall objective of this study is to examine the pathways between gender inequality, food insecurity, and maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) in newly married households in Nepal and to adapt an existing intervention to this population. My main hypothesis is that gender inequality and food insecurity intersect to compromise pre- conception health, which in turn contributes to poor MNCH. This research will assess this hypothesis through three specific aims. In Aim 1, I will conduct qualitative interviews with newly married women, their husbands, and mothers-in-law to understand the interactions between gender inequality and food insecurity at the household level. In Aim 2, I will collect longitudinal data with newly married women for 18 months to evaluate how household gender dynamics and food insecurity impact maternal and child health and change in the first 18 months of marriage. In Aim 3, I will build off an existing food insecurity intervention developed by Helen Keller International, to adapt it for newly married women and their households and include an empowerment component, and test the feasibility of this intervention in a small subset of households. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare me for the successful submission of an R01 application to test the intervention developed in Aim 3 in a larger population. Project Narrative In Nepal in 2011 about 30% of children and 27% of women were underweight and just over 50% of household reported some level of food insecurity. Nepal has high levels of gender inequality, reinforced by house dynamics, where young, newly married women have especially low status in the household and are at increased risk of poor health outcomes, yet little research and few interventions have focused on this population. The knowledge gained and the intervention designed in this study will help improve maternal and child health by addressing the intersection of gender inequality and food insecurity among newly married households in Nepal.",Understanding the role of gender inequality and food insecurity on maternal and child health,9526909,K01HD086281,"['Anthropometry ', ' Appointment ', ' Asia ', ' Award ', '

"Social networks, acculturation, and food behaviors and values among Mexican-American families PROJECT SUMMARY The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is two to three times higher among Mexican Americans than non-Latino whites, and Mexican Americans are more likely to develop diabetes at younger ages and suffer higher rates of complications. Many of these complications could be reduced substantially by targeting health behaviors such as diet and exercise; however, research has shown that, for Mexican Americans, healthful diet-related behaviors, as well as obesity prevalence, decrease with greater acculturation, including years in the U.S. or English-language adoption. Social networks play an important role in obesity and diet through social support, access to resources, social engagement, and social norms. However, an important and unanswered question is the extent to which less-healthy food behaviors and values are diffused across social networks among Mexican Americans and whether the diffusion of food behaviors and values differs by acculturation status. The goal of this proposal, in response to PAR-16-064 `Small Grants for New Investigators to Promote Diversity in Health-Research (R21),' is to examine the influence of the personal social networks of Mexican American families on food behaviors and values as well as objectively measured health outcomes (i.e., hbA1c and BMI). This project will build on our ongoing collaborations large Catholic churches in Los Angeles and New York by examining two specific aims: (1) To quantitatively characterize the personal networks of English-dominant and Spanish-dominant Mexican American families and test the network characteristics that are associated with unhealthful eating patterns, diabetes, and obesity and (2) To qualitatively explore how social networks influence English-dominant and Spanish-dominant Mexican American families' food behaviors and values. We will explore group differences in social networks between 81 Spanish-dominant and 81 English-dominant Mexican-American adults attending Sunday services at large Catholic churches. We will then select 25 information-rich cases for in-depth interviews and ethnographic observations, which will allow us to gain insights into food behaviors and values that may be socially transmitted. This study will provide preliminary data to develop an R34 application targeting specific social network features that influence diabetes-related behaviors among this vulnerable population. This study represents an important step in Dr. Karen Flórez's progress towards becoming an independent New Investigator and will advance the NIDDK's mission to increase diversity in health-related research.

The results generated from this study will: (a) strengthen the evidence base by elucidating the causal effects of promising, large scale nutrition interventions on obesity and related disparities; (b) identify characteristics of nutrition environments near schools where such nutrition policies are most effective; and (c) illuminate environments (inside and/or near schools) where additional interventions are needed. Collectively, the study results have the potential to inform the course of health and nutrition policies to prevent obesity and reduce health disparities early in life.",Population-level interventions and community environment effects on child obesity disparities,9655367,R01HL136718,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Beverages ', ' Body Weight ', ' California ', ' Candy ', ' Confection ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Play ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' sound ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Nutrition Policy ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Characteristics ', ' obesity in children ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' child adiposity ', ' obesity prevention ', ' soft drink ', ' soda ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' federal policy ', ' population health ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' food environment ', ' built environment ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Child Health ', ' health goals ', ' ']",NHLBI,SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,711587,0.16370453524145603
"The Food Allergy Superheroes Training (FAST) Program: Increasing Adherence to Food Allergy Safety Guidelines Food Allergies (FA) are a growing health crisis affecting approximately 2.0 million young children (i.e., < 8 years of age) in the United States. Strict avoidance (e.g., elimination of allergenic foods from one’s diet) is the only intervention capable of preventing potentially devasting health-related sequelae including anaphylaxis and death. Adhering to recommendations for strict avoidance (i.e., not ingesting, touching, or playing with potentially allergenic food) is challenging for young children. Youths from disadvantaged backgrounds (i.e., low socioeconomic status) are particularly impacted by FAs (i.e., greater financial burden, increased risk of complications); thus, it is critical that adherence-promoting interventions take into account SES-related disparities. Behavioral Skills Training (BST) is a brief (i.e., <5 sessions, 15-20 min/session), portable, skills- based, and engaging intervention designed to educate, reinforce through modeling, provide praise/corrective feedback, and practice (i.e., rehearsal) the skills necessary for children to remain adherent to safety-related behaviors. Prior research has shown BST superior to education alone. The primary aim of this R21 proposal is to test the efficacy of a 5-session intervention designed to increase adherence to FA safety guidelines among low-income, young children (6-8 years of age) with FAs. This intervention, the Food Allergy Superheroes Training (FAST) Program, will be developed and refined across Phases 1a and 1b to target skills beneficial to promote adherence to FA guidelines (i.e., food avoidance). During Phase 1a, we will recruit a parent-child advisory board to aide in integrating principles of BST within the FAST Program manual. We will then examine the initial acceptability and feasibility of the FAST Program in an open trial with 10 low-income, young children with FAs to further refine the intervention’s content. During Phase 1b, we will randomize 50 young children with a FA who are from a low-income background to receive either the FAST Program or FA knowledge. We will employ developmentally relevant FA assessments (i.e., child-report, role-play, in situ) before, after, and one- month post-intervention as our primary outcomes. Aim 1: Determine feasibility and acceptability of the FAST intervention. We will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention with 60 participants (n=10 in pilot trial [Phase 1a] and n=50 in a preliminary randomized trial [Phase 1b]). Aim 2: Estimate the effect size of the FAST intervention relative to FA knowledge alone. Adherence will be measured via a multi-modal, FA assessment including child-report, role-play, and in situ assessment. This form of naturalistic, FA assessment will be designed to measure the child’s behavior (i.e., ingest food, touch or play with food, etc.) in a safe yet realistic manner. This study will contribute to the field’s knowledge of efficacious interventions for promoting adherence among young children with FAs.

"Designing Food Voucher Programs to Reduce Disparities in Healthy Diets Abstract Improving diets through increased food and vegetable (F&V) consumption significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Programs increasing the accessibility and affordability of F&Vs among low-income Americans have been hindered by the food consumption cycle associated with poverty: the tendency to over-consume calories shortly after receiving funds at the beginning of each month, draining the budget for F&V purchases, or for all food purchases, by month's end. Increasing food assistance funding alone does not resolve this problem, but an emerging theory about dietary behavior suggests that providing funds for food in smaller installments distributed throughout the month will smooth the consumption cycle and improve healthy eating—counteracting the tendency to respond to lump sum, once-monthly funding installments by purchasing calorie-dense foods immediately after funds are received. The theory also suggests that funds targeted toward specific healthy foods (e.g., F&Vs) will improve diets more than untargeted funds, despite the in- convenience of utilizing targeted funds. Our preliminary data support both hypotheses, which we will rigorously test in a real-world setting by comparing alternative approaches for delivering food purchasing vouchers. We have established and tested the infrastructure to provide vouchers accepted by all major food stores (e.g., supermarkets, corner shops) in two low-income neighborhoods. Leveraging this innovative infrastructure, in Aim 1 we propose a randomized trial with a two-by-two factorial design, comparing $20 of vouchers valid for one month to four $5 vouchers each valid for a sequential week of the month (lump sum versus distributed funding), and comparing vouchers restricted to F&V purchases to vouchers redeemable for any food (targeted versus untargeted funding). Low-income adults (N=288) recruited through our community partners will be randomized to one of four 6-month interventions: monthly targeted, monthly untargeted, weekly targeted, or weekly untargeted vouchers. Participants will be assessed through efficient verbal 24-hour dietary recalls validated among low-literacy populations, to determine daily consumption of F&Vs and metrics of overall dietary quality at months 0, 6 and 12 (6 months after vouchers end). Additional surveys will identify moderators and mediators of dietary improvement. In Aim 2, we will calculate the cost-effectiveness of the voucher programs. Vouchers and other interventions that support healthy diets reduce population-level CVD disparities over the course of decades. Hence, the full costs and benefits of such interventions are not possible to directly observe through time-limited trials. Following recent NIH policy statements, we will overcome this problem by applying an innovative, validated microsimulation modeling approach—a systems science method that integrates trial results with comprehensive data on the effect of dietary changes on CVD risks and costs over the life course. We will identify which voucher delivery strategies cost-effectively reduce CVD disparities—addressing a key scientific uncertainty in healthy eating intervention research. Public health relevance This study tackles a stubborn scientific issue—how to design and implement cost-effective interventions to support healthy eating among low-income populations—in an effort to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities between low- and higher-income Americans. We will test two hypotheses: that increasing the fre- quency of food assistance but not the overall amount of the assistance, and targeting such assistance towards healthy fruits and vegetables, increases dietary quality in a manner that can cost-effectively reduce CVD dis- parities. Our test of both hypotheses is of potentially high impact and timely, as 1 in 7 Americans are currently enrolled in nutrition programs that use monthly, untargeted funding approaches, but program directors are considering new approaches to reduce disparities in healthy diets through program modifications.",Designing Food Voucher Programs to Reduce Disparities in Healthy Diets,9747958,R01HL132814,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Budgets ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Reducing diet ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Vegetables ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Disease Costs ', ' improved ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' good diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' meetings ', ' Supermarket ', ' American ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Sum ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Low Literacy Population ', ' Modification ', ' food consumption ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' federal poverty level ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' farmers markets ', ' recruit ', ' secondary endpoint ', ' secondary end point ', ' Unhealthy Diet ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,535179,0.17111252120019357
"Dietary Quality, Cognitive Decline and Brain Health in Puerto Rican Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this proposal is that consumption of highly processed foods contributes to cognitive decline with aging. These dietary effects may lead to health disparities in cognitive decline due to the known greater consumption of highly processed foods in low-income populations. While many factors are associated with the effects of a diet characterized by highly processed foods, including displacement of healthy foods and the myriad of nutrients associated with these, we propose that two nutrients, in particular, may have effects through known or emerging pathways that affect brain function. First, there is evidence that highly processed foods contribute to greater intake of phosphorus (P) through P-based food additives which can increase food P content by ≥70%. Vascular risk factors predict cognitive decline and excess P may elevate CVD risk. However, the role of P in cognitive decline remains unclear. One novel pathway is compensatory elevation in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a predictor of vascular calcification and CVD. Klotho, a putative anti-aging factor, may be protective against CVD and cognitive decline. Among mice, a high P diet reduced klotho secretion. Excessive P consumption may lower klotho and impair cognitive function through modulation of FGF23, but human data remain sparse. P also elevates parathyroid hormone (PTH), which predicts CVD mortality and presence of cerebral infarcts. Second, vitamin B6 (B6), a critical cofactor for ≥100 metabolic reactions, is easily lost with food processing and unlike other B vitamins is not added back to enriched grains. We have shown that low B6 status was associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and depressive symptoms in Puerto Rican adults. Earlier work with non-Hispanic white men, showed associations of both diet and plasma B6 (pyridoxl-5'-phosphate,PLP) with 3 y cognitive decline. Latinos appear to be disproportionately burdened by cognitive impairment compared to non-Hispanic whites. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that Puerto Ricans have >twice the odds of low global cognitive function compared to Mexicans. With the growing and aging Latino population in the U.S likely to contribute to major increases in the burden of cognitive decline, it is critical that we improve our understanding of preventive risk factors that may inform interventions. We will use data from the Boston Puerto Rican Health study (BPRHS), a longitudinal cohort study of U.S. mainland Puerto Ricans (45-74 y) with diet, nutritional biomarkers, and cognitive function testing data available at baseline and 2 and 5 y follow-up. We will recruit BPRHS participants to return (~ 8-y from baseline) for a repeat battery of cognitive exams and, for a subset, an MRI scan. We will quantify the associations between processed foods consumption, P status (serum P, FGF23, klotho, and PTH), dietary B6, and PLP, as exposures, with ~8 y cognitive decline (psychometric testing) and brain structure, cerebral infarcts, white matter integrity, and connectivity (MRI) at ~8 y, as outcomes. Further the potential mediative roles of inflammation (CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) will be measured. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive decline is an increasing health concern among U.S. Latino adults, particularly those of Puerto Rican heritage. The proposed project aims to quantify the importance of highly processed foods consumption and phosphorus and vitamin B6 status in relation to cognitive decline (psychometric testing) and brain health (MRI) among older U.S. mainland Puerto Rican adults. With the growing and aging Latino population in the U.S likely to contribute to major increases in the burden of cognitive decline, these data will provide critical information to improve our understanding of preventive risk factors that may inform interventions.","Dietary Quality, Cognitive Decline and Brain Health in Puerto Rican Adults",9731373,R01AG055948,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', '

"Food access, social connectedness, and allostatic load after a natural disaster: a mixed-methods study PROJECT SUMMARY  Natural disasters impose extensive stressors in a society. A major stressor is privation in access to adequate quantity and quality of food and water. The allostatic load model posits that brain stimuli (e.g. memories) from such stressors overloads multi-system physiological stress responses, first in the primary neuroendocrine and inflammatory fast-responders and then in cardiometabolic pathways; yet adaptive mechanisms may occur as the brain-body adjusts to this new state. Adaptation to post-disaster stress may ensue as an afflicted society recovers together through social connectedness. Post-disaster research has seldom studied food access privation stress and coping social connection strategies deployed to mitigate these, much less in association to time-sensitive physiological responses that predict long-term disease. Most studies assessing post-disaster stress have been retrospective assessments long after the event or have not measured multiple markers that could validate the time-sensitive allostatic load mechanisms. Thus, there is a gap in knowledge on how food access stress activates allostatic mechanisms shortly after a disaster, and how potential adaptation against this stress is gained from social connectedness. The island-wide devastation caused by hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico (PR) provides a unique and timely opportunity to address these gaps in a minority population.  Our overall goal is to identify levels of influence on which food/water privation operated as stressor after hurricane Maria among PR adults, as well as domains of influence where social connectedness strategies moderated such stressor, and how these trigger time-sensitive adverse or adaptive allostatic responses. The central hypothesis is that higher food/water privations will be associated with higher allostatic load, but this will be mitigated for those with high social support. The project will use a concurrent transformative mixed- methods design combining quantitative data collected from the island-wide cohort ‘PROSPECT: Puerto Rico Observational Study of Psychosocial, Environmental, and Chronic disease Trends’, with narrative interviews among adults and food establishment stakeholders to triangulate findings as well as raise advocacy for better food access. Our specific aims are to (1) estimate access to food/water and association with allostatic load; (2) determine moderating role of social connectedness on the association of food/water privations and allostatic load; and (3) qualitatively assess memories of food/water privation and coping through social connectedness in individuals and food establishment stakeholders, and determine association with acute physiological stress.  This project will identify priority needs and timely best-practices for adequate post-disaster access to food and water, and concomitant social coping strategies that will sustain optimal physiological well-being in PR and disaster-prone areas. This is paramount for Puerto Ricans, a minority community with multiple social and health disparities and at high-risk for natural disasters. A home-grown team of Puerto Rican expert researchers will lead this project to answer NIMHD’s priorities of clarifying and solving time-pressing disparities. NARRATIVE It is still unclear how stress from privations in access to food and water activates allostatic load (i.e. physiological stress) shortly after a natural disaster, and how potential adaptation against this stress is obtained from social connectedness. The goal of this proposal is to use a concurrent transformative mixed- methods design to identify food/water privations and social connectedness strategies after hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico, and how these operate together to trigger adverse or adaptive time-sensitive allostatic load responses, using quantitative data from a large population-based study as well as narrative interviews. The ultimate goal is to inform best practices for food access and social support as part of disaster readiness and prevent physiologic disorders and related long-term conditions in Puerto Rico and other disaster-prone areas.","Food access, social connectedness, and allostatic load after a natural disaster: a mixed-methods study",9772545,R21MD013650,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Sympathins ', ' Catecholamines ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Therapeutic Dehydroepiandrosterone ', ' Prasterone ', ' Dehydroisoandrosterone ', ' DHEA ', ' Androstenolone ', ' dehydroepiandrosterone ', ' Disasters ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Hurricane ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Island ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' nutrition ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Privatization ', ' Psychology ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Process Assessment ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Advocacy ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' psychosocial ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' social ', ' acute stress ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' food quality ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' alertness ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' allostatic load ', ' minority health ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Food Access ', ' social disparities ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' minority communities ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' ']",NIMHD,DE DIEGO RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R21,2019,167094,0.04677923322339993
"Good Bowls: Empowering Communities to Achieve Good Food Access and Health Equity PROJECT SUMMARY Poverty, ethnic minority status, and rural residence are strong predictors of poor health. There are multiple contributors to high chronic disease rates, including food insecurity (lack of access to affordable, nutritionally valuable food) and unemployment. Rural poverty in the Southeast is exacerbated by reduced economic opportunity associated with agricultural transitions and historical loan discrimination against farmers of color. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 86% of the $2.7 trillion annual health care expenditures are to care for chronic conditions. Reducing food insecurity and increasing economic opportunity are key to combatting health disparities in low-income communities. We are pursuing a business model that provides healthy, affordable food and economic opportunities for farmers and small businesses in rural communities. Corner stores are significant sources of food in these communities but fresh produce and meats have a short shelf-life. Pre-packaged frozen meals are convenient and have a much longer shelf life but are traditionally high in sodium with few vegetables or whole grains. We propose a cost-offset or sliding scale model, in which locally sourced, healthy frozen meals (Good Bowls) are sold at a higher price in high- end stores and at a lower price in corner stores and at worksites. Using a franchise-like arrangement, Good Bowls, LLC in collaboration with a larger Value Added Processing Facility (VAPF) will provide the food production and distribution expertise, recipes, packaging, labeling, food safety, marketing, and general technical assistance to two smaller/rural VAPFs that will produce Good Bowls and sell them to both higher- and lower-cost food retailers. Good Bowls recipes, developed to promote an evidence-based healthful dietary patter (Mediterranean-style diet) were well received in a small pilot study by both high and low income consumers. By using traditional, lower-cost southern vegetables like sweet potatoes, collard greens, and peppers, we have created an affordable and well-liked product. Using grade B produce or “seconds” will avoid food waste, give farmers more income, and reduce the cost of production. Good Bowls will provide the identical high-quality product to both lower- and higher-income consumers, just at different price points. Family size bowls will be available and our website (with links to the packaging) will provide recipes for all products and simple tips for healthy eating on a budget. Specific Aims: AIM 1) Viability of Good Bowls production in one larger/central facility near Chapel Hill and two satellite/franchises in rural, low income NC communities (customer satisfaction, production capability and cost, sales, and retail price points); AIM 2) Early stage impact on food insecurity and nutrition (replacement of less healthy options and impact of supplemental web-based nutrition information/education) and AIM 3) Contributions to economic development in rural communities for farmers and small businesses (revenue and jobs creation). PROJECT NARRATIVE Poverty, ethnic minority status, and rural residence are associated with poor health and food insecurity (lack of access to affordable, nutritionally valuable food). To address food-related health disparities, we will create healthy delicious frozen meals for sale in local corner stores using food from local farmers produced in local commercial kitchens and sold at a subsidized price. By improving community nutrition and job opportunities, we hope to improve the health of the community.",Good Bowls: Empowering Communities to Achieve Good Food Access and Health Equity,9775399,R41MD014075,"['Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Altruism ', ' altruistic ', ' Budgets ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economical Development ', ' Economic Development ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Family Sizes ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Freezing ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Marketing ', ' Meat ', ' Motivation ', ' North Carolina ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Running ', ' Sales ', ' Schools ', ' Seasons ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Leanness ', ' Thinness ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Vegetables ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Businesses ', ' Rural Community ', ' Food Vending Machine ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' nutrition education ', ' diet education ', ' Link ', ' farmer ', ' Distress ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' wasting ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Slide ', ' Red Pepper ', ' Green Pepper ', ' Bell Peppers ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine ', ' SNAP ', ' Collard Greens ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' Recipe ', ' Modeling ', ' Sweet potato - dietary ', ' Sweet Potato ', ' Pseudo Yam ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Food Safety ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' Food Access ', ' Chronic Care ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' community organizations ', ' combat ', ' evidence base ', ' health equity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' rural poverty ', ' rural residence ', ' rural households ', ' rural dwelling ', ' service delivery ', ' Food production ', ' food insecurity ', ' ']",NIMHD,"EQUITI FOODS, LLC",R41,2019,207455,0.2685561235156352
"Evaluation and Enhancement of the Summer Food Service Program in Youth from an Urban, Low-Resource Community PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal entitled, ‘Evaluation and enhancement of the Summer Food Service Program in youth from an urban, low-resource community’, is for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) for Dr. E. Whitney Evans, PhD, RD an Instructor (Research) at the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center (WCDRC) at The Miriam Hospital and Brown University Medical School. Dr. Evans received her PhD in nutritional epidemiology from the Tufts University Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, where she developed expertise in nutrition and the analytical skills to study the role of diet in relative weight in youth. Dr. Evans’ long-term career goal is to draw upon this background to design and conduct innovative obesity interventions specific to low-income youth. Thus, in response to evidence that low-income youth are at increased risk for excess summer weight gain, this application focuses on an existing federal nutrition assistance program – the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) – to determine how it can be enhanced to minimize income-related health disparities.  To help Dr. Evans successfully carry out this research and achieve her long-term career goal, this award will provide training in four key content areas: 1) qualitative research methods, 2) the design and conduct of behavioral obesity interventions, 3) advanced statistical methods to analyze data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 4) weight-related health disparities. This training will occur through formal didactics and hands-on research experience under the guidance of a highly qualified team of mentors. Dr. Evans will work closely with her primary mentor, Dr. Rena Wing, an internationally recognized obesity researcher, and four co- mentors: Dr. Sara Folta (qualitative research methods); Dr. Elissa Jelalian (behavioral obesity interventions for youth); Dr. Richard Jones (RCT statistical analysis); and Dr. Elsie Taveras (weight-related health disparities).  Through three complimentary studies, the proposed research project will thoroughly evaluate the SFSP. First, it will examine how dietary intake patterns (total energy intake and diet quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index, 2010), change in BMI z-score (as a proxy for change in total body adiposity), and SFSP participation over the summer relate to each other low-income schoolchildren, ages 6-12 years. Second, through focus groups with low-income families, it will identify motivators for and barriers to SFSP participation. Findings from these two formative studies along with the training Dr. Evans receives in behavioral obesity intervention development will be used to design an enhanced version of the SFSP. The enhanced SFSP will target relevant obesity risk factors identified in study 1 as well as SFSP participation barriers identified in study 2 to improve SFSP engagement. The feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of this enhanced version of the SFSP will then be compared to the standard SFSP in an RCT on the basis of participation, diet and excess summer weight gain. This research will form the basis for a larger efficacy trial of the intervention to be proposed in an R01 application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed K01 application is designed to assist Dr. Evans in establishing an independent research career in the field of childhood obesity by providing training, experience and mentorship in the areas of: (1) qualitative research, (2) innovative behavioral obesity interventions; (3) advanced statistical skills to analyze data from randomized controlled trials; and (4) weight-related health disparities. As obesity prevalence continues to rise among low-income youth, there is a need for novel interventions that specifically help them manage income- related barriers and prevent excess weight gain. Through three complimentary studies with children from a low-resource, urban community, the proposed research project will clarify how participation in the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), dietary intake patterns and excess summer weight gain relate to each other, identify salient barriers to SFSP participation, and test whether an enhanced version of the SFSP is more acceptable and effective at preventing excess weight gain than the standard program.","Evaluation and Enhancement of the Summer Food Service Program in Youth from an Urban, Low-Resource Community",9697407,K01DK110142,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Services ', ' Foundations ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Lipids ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"The Influence of Quick-Service Restaurants on Children's Diets 7. Project Summary/Abstract Addressing childhood obesity remains one of the greatest public health priorities in the U.S., particularly among minority and lower socioeconomic status (SES) populations where the prevalence of obesity is highest. Studies have found a positive association between quick-service restaurant (QSR) food consumption and body mass index (BMI) among children. This is likely due in part to the high caloric content of foods from QSRs, especially the traditional side dishes and beverages (i.e. fried potato products and sugar-sweetened beverages) which can provide up to 350 additional calories per children’s meal compared with the healthier options available. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence the selection of healthier or less healthy children’s meal side dishes and beverages can have important implications for addressing obesity and health disparities. The proposed research will examine QSR environments (both the physical environment and verbal prompts), as well as parent-child interactions, that promote or discourage the selection of healthier children’s meal side dishes/ beverages. Additionally, we will analyze the impact of healthier side dish/beverage selection on overall meal consumption. Environmental assessments will occur in 136 QSRs in socioeconomically and ethnically diverse communities. Interactions when ordering will be observed among 64 parent-child pairs, and overall meal consumption will be assessed using plate waste methodology among 850 children. Expanding upon Dr. Cohen’s prior nutrition and plate waste research in low-income school districts, this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide additional training in behavior change techniques, qualitative data collection, analyses involving mixed-methods, behavioral/ family-centered theories, and conducting research to address health disparities. Dr. Cohen has the full support of The School of Science and Engineering at Merrimack College, as well as her exceptional, multidisciplinary team of mentors, who are committed to helping Dr. Cohen successfully complete the proposed training and research and become a successful independent researcher. Study results will be used to inform future intervention studies involving both QSRs and families to improve children’s selection/consumption of healthier QSR foods. This award will provide Dr. Cohen with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator conducting cross- disciplinary research that uses behavior change techniques and is informed by studying both environmental influences and the role of parents (applying qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research) to improve the diets of underserved children and reduced their risk of obesity. 8. Project Narrative Children frequently consume foods from quick-service restaurants, which are associated with increased risk of overweight; therefore research is needed to better understand how to improve food selections in this environment. This study will examine the influence of quick-service restaurant environments, as well as parent-child interactions in the restaurants, on children’s side dish and beverage selection and meal consumption. This research will provide an important foundation towards addressing childhood obesity and health disparities, and will improve the diets children in quick-service restaurants.",The Influence of Quick-Service Restaurants on Children's Diets,9748522,K01DK107810,"['Award ', ' Beverages ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' energy source ', ' Energy-Generating Resources ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Selections ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parents ', ' Potato ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Work ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Visual ', ' wasting ', ' sugar ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' Calories ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' behavior change ', ' Physical environment ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' Employee ', ' Nutrient ', ' skills ', ' parental role ', ' parent role ', ' parental influence ', ' parent influence ', ' theories ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' obesity in children ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' child adiposity ', ' Food Energy ', ' food consumption ', ' obesity prevention ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk of obesity ', ' risk for obesity ', ' parental involvement ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health priorities ', ' school district ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ']",NIDDK,MERRIMACK COLLEGE,K01,2019,126992,0.19343240252340535
"Understanding the role of gender inequality and food insecurity on maternal and child health Project Summary/Abstract Career Goals: This is a resubmission of an application for a K01 Career Development Award in Population Research for Nadia Diamond-Smith, PhD, MSc, an Assistant Professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Her preliminary research focuses on maternal and child health in South Asia, specifically the role of gender inequality and food insecurity. In the short term, she aims to build on this work, investigating the effect of gender inequality and food insecurity on maternal and child health outcomes in newly married women in Nepal. In the long term, she aspires to conduct research that results in interventions that will improve gender inequality and food access, and ultimately improve maternal and child health outcomes for women across their life course, with a focus on the pre-conception period. The knowledge and experience she will gain from this K01 award will prepare her to compete for NICHD R01 funding to test the household level behavior change and food insecurity intervention to address household dynamics around women's empowerment and access to food and nutrition in Nepal developed in this proposal in a randomized intervention trial. Environment: The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) provides generous support for junior faculty. UCSF researchers have a long history of pursuing innovative ideas in reproductive health, studying food insecurity, and working in low and middle-income countries. Key Elements of Research Career Development Plan: Dr. Diamond-Smith has a strong background in public health (epidemiology and biostatistics) and demographic methods, with substantial experience analyzing large datasets and conducting qualitative data. This career development award will enable her to address several remaining gaps in her training specific to her career goals, and to gain applied experience planning and executing a primary data collection study on gender inequality and food insecurity, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. She seeks training in (1) maternal and child nutrition and food insecurity; (2) women's empowerment theory and measurement; and (3) implementation sciences, including designing behavioral interventions and evaluating interventions. To achieve these goals, Dr. Diamond-Smith has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team. It includes her Primary Mentor, Sheri Weiser, MD, MPH, in the School of Medicine at UCSF with a secondary appointment in Global Health Sciences at UCSF, who has extensive experience conducting research and developing interventions on food insecurity and health outcomes, and co-mentor Mallory Johnson, PhD, a Clinical Health Psychologist in UCSF's School of Medicine and an expert behavior change interventions and intervention design and evaluation. Her team includes three additional, complementary advisors: Cynthia Harper, PhD, in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at UCSF, with an expertise in demography and women's reproductive health and experience working in Nepal; Anita Raj, PhD, in the Division of Global Public Health, Department of Medicine, at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), with training in Developmental Psychology and extensive experience in South Asia on topics including sexual and reproductive health, maternal and child health, and gender based violence; and George W. Rutherford, MD, Vice Chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the School of Medicine at UCSF, with expertise in pediatric epidemiology and interventions to improve child health. Dr. Diamond-Smith's training will include a combination of structured reading lists and tutorials with mentors, coursework, workshops, conference presentations and attendance, and seminars. Description of the Research Project: Women and children in Nepal are especially vulnerable to malnutrition, which I hypothesize is due to pervasive gender inequality across women's life course combined with food insecurity at the individual and household level. I hypothesize that household dynamics around women's empowerment and access to food are especially crucial in the pre-conception period. The overall objective of this study is to examine the pathways between gender inequality, food insecurity, and maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) in newly married households in Nepal and to adapt an existing intervention to this population. My main hypothesis is that gender inequality and food insecurity intersect to compromise pre- conception health, which in turn contributes to poor MNCH. This research will assess this hypothesis through three specific aims. In Aim 1, I will conduct qualitative interviews with newly married women, their husbands, and mothers-in-law to understand the interactions between gender inequality and food insecurity at the household level. In Aim 2, I will collect longitudinal data with newly married women for 18 months to evaluate how household gender dynamics and food insecurity impact maternal and child health and change in the first 18 months of marriage. In Aim 3, I will build off an existing food insecurity intervention developed by Helen Keller International, to adapt it for newly married women and their households and include an empowerment component, and test the feasibility of this intervention in a small subset of households. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare me for the successful submission of an R01 application to test the intervention developed in Aim 3 in a larger population. Project Narrative In Nepal in 2011 about 30% of children and 27% of women were underweight and just over 50% of household reported some level of food insecurity. Nepal has high levels of gender inequality, reinforced by house dynamics, where young, newly married women have especially low status in the household and are at increased risk of poor health outcomes, yet little research and few interventions have focused on this population. The knowledge gained and the intervention designed in this study will help improve maternal and child health by addressing the intersection of gender inequality and food insecurity among newly married households in Nepal.",Understanding the role of gender inequality and food insecurity on maternal and child health,9740933,K01HD086281,"['Anthropometry ', ' Appointment ', ' Asia ', ' Award ', '

"FOOD (Food to Overcome Outcomes Disparities) Project Summary The World Health Organization defines food security as having access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life. Food security includes both physical and economic access to food that meets people's dietary needs and preferences. The 18-item, 12-month time-referenced U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module (USDA) categorizes individuals as having high food security, marginal food security, low food security, or very low food security. Food insecurity is growing in the U.S., with an overall prevalence of 12.7% (low and very low food security). The prevalence of food insecurity among immigrant and minority communities exceeds the national average. Food insecurity is associated with non-adherence to treatment. Food-insecure patients are more likely to postpone care and often cannot afford prescribed medication(s). Food-insecure patients have significantly higher levels of nutritional risk, depression, financial strain, and lower quality of life. Nutrition interventions result in enhanced quality of life. Cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to both food insecurity and its impact, due to the intensity of treatment protocols and the disease process itself. A study among a cohort of underserved cancer patients in New York City showed that 56% were food insecure, with 38% of the cohort with very low food security. Treatment adherence is an important determinant of survival among cancer patients. However, among ethnic minority cancer patients, unmet socioeconomic and supportive care needs are associated with patient-reported missed radiation, and/or chemotherapy appointments. Food insecurity potentially acts as a mediating factor, as functional, social, and emotional well-being decrease significantly with increasing food insecurity. Prior to our work, there had been only one study examining food insecurity in cancer patients. There is to date no evidence base on interventions to address food insecurity, and their potential to ameliorate cancer and other chronic disease treatment completion disparities. Food to Overcome Outcomes Disparities (FOOD) addresses this gap as the first large study of its kind to examine food interventions in vulnerable populations and their impact on breast cancer treatment completion. Results have the potential to guide program and policy change. FOOD will utilize a three arm randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of a hospital-based medically tailored food pantry (Pantry) versus a food voucher program (Voucher) versus a home grocery delivery program (Delivery) on cancer treatment completion. FOOD is a partnership between the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) Immigrant Health and Cancer Disparities (IHCD) Service, the Food Bank for New York City, the New York City Council, the New York City Health and Hospitals, God's Love We Deliver, and Saint Barnabas Hospital. This study builds upon the foundation laid by a seminal pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial, which examined a scalable, clinic-based food pantry, a food voucher program, and home grocery delivery. Project Narrative This is the first study to address the impact of food insecurity among the growing underserved, and immigrant and minority, breast cancer patient population in active treatment for cure. The FOOD study builds upon the team's unique approaches to addressing and studying food insecurity and cancer treatment completion, including implementing food pantries co-located within oncology clinics and studying the impact of a pilot food voucher program and a home grocery delivery program. FOOD has the potential to significantly improve the growing issues of food insecurity and barriers to emergency food resources that hamper breast cancer treatment completion among medically underserved populations in New York City, and across the nation in large metropolitan areas.",FOOD (Food to Overcome Outcomes Disparities),9701947,R01CA230446,"['Appointment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Kentucky ', ' Love ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' food resource ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Saints ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Depression screen ', ' depression screening ', ' Radiation ', ' voucher ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Intake ', ' Interruption ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' MSKCC ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Seminal ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' active method ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' food security ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' chemotherapy ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' symptom improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' treatment adherence ', ' arm ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' minority communities ', ' intervention cost ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' food insecurity ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2019,691570,0.3032878878098982
"Improving Nutritional Choices in Adolescents PROJECT SUMMARY  Excess weight is a public health priority for all sectors of the US population and particularly for Black adolescents who have a disproportionately high prevalence of obesity and overweight. Research suggests that consumption of fast food and calorie dense foods prepared outside of the home contribute to a higher body mass index. Black youth are more likely than their White peers to live in low-income communities with a high density of fast food restaurants. There is a need for interventions to help adolescents make healthy choices in these obesogenic environments.  Our clinical work in the Michigan Pediatric Outpatient Weight Evaluation and Reduction (MPOWER) program suggests that adolescents find it difficult to make healthy choices in obesogenic settings, such as fast food restaurants. From our initial MPOWERed Messages study, we found that adolescents welcomed health- related text messages (based on Self Determination Theory and Motivational Interviewing) if they viewed them as personally relevant and if they were received at times when they faced dietary choices. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that delivering messages (tailored to users’ preferences and values) at a time and place when they are making a dietary choice (e.g., in a restaurant) would positively influence their selection.  In a first step toward exploring this, we combined our experience in the development of tailored texts for adolescents, with state-of-the-art geo-fencing technology, to develop the Location Initiated Individualized Texts for African American Adolescent Health (LIITA3H) mobile application. This app a) accurately identified when users were in an eating venue such as a restaurant, b) automatically sent culturally relevant messages (based on focus group input from the target population) tailored to user preferences and the menu options at their location with the aim of prompting users to make a healthy choice, and c) allowed users to submit an annotated photo of their food choice. This study demonstrated the app’s acceptability and feasibility, and the accuracy of the technology to deliver tailored messages at the point of purchase. However, we did not pilot test whether receipt of these ‘just in time’ personalized messages, actually influenced participants’ food choices.  This R21 project will focus on 1) enhancing the LIITA3H app by incorporating user input regarding its design and by allowing greater automation in the identification of eating venues, and 2) pilot testing the impact of the app on the number of calories purchased from, and number of visits to, fast food restaurants. This will provide data regarding effect size, and will form the foundation for planning a future randomized trial which would include a larger population and a greater range of eating venues. A better understanding of how receipt of ‘just in time” tailored messages, made possible by new location-based technology, alters behavior among a high risk population, will help future efforts to address obesity and other illnesses impacted by lifestyle choices. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this R21 project is to examine whether the LIITA3H mobile application (designed by the research team as part of a R41 study), by acting at the point of purchase, helps Black adolescents purchase fewer calories from, and make fewer visits to, fast food restaurants. In this study the app, which uses location based technology to identify when a user is in an eating venue, and then delivers culturally and individually tailored messages to prompt healthy choices, will be enhanced and pilot tested. By using ‘just-in-time’ cues to action to help adolescents make healthy choices in obesogenic settings such as fast food restaurants, the app will promote the achievement of a healthy weight and a reduction in weight-related illnesses.",Improving Nutritional Choices in Adolescents,9609464,R21HD093835,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Automation ', ' Behavior ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cues ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Libraries ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Marketing ', ' Michigan ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Self Determination ', ' Societies ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Calories ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Location ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' tailored messaging ', ' group intervention ', ' obesogenic ', ' obesigenic ', ' public health priorities ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' healthy weight ', ' adolescent health ', ' ethnic identity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' secondary analysis ', ' lower income families ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' weight loss program ', ' weight loss programming ', ' Global Positioning System ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2019,195000,0.077448541263316
"Gentrification, food environment, and risk for obesity: A mixed methods approach ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed pre-doctoral training fellowship serves two overarching goals: 1) To enhance my quantitative and qualitative research methods skills toward applying for and obtaining a mixed methods R01grant; and 2) To apply and refine my public health training by conducting a dissertation research project to understand the effect of the changing food environment on obesity in a historically low-socioeconomic status (SES) community of color undergoing gentrification. Background: Since the late 1990s, the neighborhood of Central Harlem in New York City has been undergoing dramatic transformation as characterized by gentrification, a mixture of divestment and redevelopment. These changes influence the food environment (i.e. grocery outlets, restaurants, street vendors, and farmers' markets) and, with it, residents' food-related practices and health. Given the high rates of nutrition-related conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in Harlem, any transformation in its food environment raises the need for investigation. The overarching question of my dissertation is: How does the changing food environment in Harlem, a neighborhood undergoing gentrification, affect residents' risk for obesity mediated by food-related dispositions and practices? Aims: The specific aims are to: 1) Examine changes in Central Harlem's food environment during 1990-2010 by analyzing the NETS database; 2) Examine whether longitudinal changes in the food practices of mothers and children are associated with changes in weight measurements and risk for obesity using the Columbia Center of Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) cohort data; 2a) Compare changes in the weights of mothers and children who have remained in Central Harlem and those who have moved from the neighborhood; 3) Use ethnographic methods (including participant observation, and in-depth interviews with a sub-set of CCCEH participants) and key informant interviews to explore ongoing changes in Harlem's food environment, and how these changes affect food practices and dispositions, thus corroborating and expanding upon the quantitative findings under Aims 1 and 2; and 4) Integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings and thus develop a provisional conceptual framework to understand the effects of gentrification on obesity as mediated by food practices and dispositions. Methods: Consistent with my training objectives, the study will apply an ethnographic and sociological framework of habitus to examine the relationship between gentrification, habitus and obesity prevalence among residents of a historically resource poor neighborhood. Specifically, I will conduct a mixed methods explanatory sequential design including three phases: 1) secondary longitudinal data analyses of the National Establishments Time-Series database and CCCEH mother-child pairs; 2) qualitative data collection and analysis by employing an ethnography of Harlem's food environment and interview with 15- 20 key informants and 45 CCCEH participants; and 3) integration of findings to develop a provisional conceptual framework that illustrates the effect o gentrification on obesity as mediated by food habitus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A neighborhood undergoing gentrification, characterized by a mixture of divestment and redevelopment, also experiences changes in its food environment and by extension in its residents' health. Using a mixed methods approach, the proposed study will examine how the changing food environment in a community of color shapes its residents' food-related dispositions and practices and, in turn, determines obesity prevalence. This investigation, the first study of its kind in the United States, will inform obesity prevention polcy and practice, improve the design of multi-level interventions addressing disparities in the obesity epidemic, and enhance our theoretical framework for bridging structural factors to individual health practices.","Gentrification, food environment, and risk for obesity: A mixed methods approach",9763409,F31HL131441,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Affect ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Fellowship ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Poverty ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Sociology ', ' taste response ', ' taste processing ', ' gustatory response ', ' gustatory processing ', ' gustatory perception ', ' Taste ', ' Gustation ', ' Taste Perception ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vendor ', ' Weight ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Childbirth ', ' child birth ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Public Health Education ', ' Public Health Training ', ' Public Health Instruction ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' obesity in children ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' child adiposity ', ' obesity prevention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnographic method ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk of obesity ', ' risk for obesity ', ' public health relevance ', ' doctoral student ', ' PhD. student ', ' PhD student ', ' Ph.D. student ', ' Ph.D student ', ' Ph.

"Impact of Medicaid ACO funding for health-related social needs on dietary quality and health Despite major advances in therapies, disparities in cancer and cardiometabolic outcomes continue to widen due to differences in socioeconomic status. Food and housing insecurity are social determinants of health that are associated with morbidity from obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and psychological stress, and food insecurity contributes to income disparities in cancer mortality. Although the associations between social needs and health are well-defined, there is a research gap as to whether policies or programs to address food and housing insecurity, particularly through health systems, improve diet, obesity, health, and healthcare utilization. Some states are experimenting with Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in their Medicaid programs with the goal of incentivizing providers and organizations to deliver higher value care, and some ACOs are starting to address social needs. In January 2020, the state of Massachusetts will, for the first time, provide funding directly to Medicaid ACOs to address food and housing needs through the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Flexible Services program. Implementation of this program is a natural experiment that could provide important knowledge about the impact of state-level funding for food and housing needs on diet and health outcomes. The main objectives of this study are to evaluate how the Flexible Services program affects the dietary quality, psychological stress, health, and health care utilization of adult ACO participants and to assess program implementation. The project will take place at five community health centers (CHCs) affiliated with Partners HealthCare, a large health care organization that has contracted with the state as a Medicaid ACO. The project is time-sensitive because the pre-program implementation assessment of diet, stress, food/housing insecurity, and access to resources must be completed before program implementation in 2020. A total of 800 Medicaid ACO patients (Med-ACO) and 200 non-Medicaid CHC patients with food/housing insecurity (Control) will be enrolled and followed for 4 years. Survey, 24-hour dietary recall (ASA24), electronic health record (EHR), and claims data will be collected. Primary outcomes will be change in dietary quality, stress, and food/housing insecurity (Aim 1) and change in body mass index, blood pressure, and acute health care utilization (emergency department visits; hospitalizations) (Aim 2) comparing: a) Med-ACO participants who screen positive for food/housing insecurity pre-implementation vs. Control, and b) Med-ACO participants who screen positive for food/housing and receive Flexible Services (exposed) vs. Med-ACO participants who screen positive but do not receive Flexible Services (not exposed). Aim 3 will assess implementation factors that influence the effectiveness of the program, guided by the RE-AIM/PRISM framework. Results will inform policymakers and researchers about the effectiveness of a novel state-level program for delivering food and housing resources through Medicaid ACOs and will help refine ongoing and future state and community programs that will reduce income disparities in cancer and cardiometabolic disease. The objectives of this proposal are to evaluate the impact of a new state Medicaid program to provide funding for food and housing services on the dietary quality, stress, health, and healthcare utilization of adult patients and to assess the implementation of the program in a large health care organization. The long-term goal of this work is to determine the effectiveness of new programs and policies to address patients’ health-related social needs and to identify facilitators and barriers to implementation of these programs, as well as unintended consequences.",Impact of Medicaid ACO funding for health-related social needs on dietary quality and health,9928610,R01DK124145,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' Incentives ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Self Management ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine ', ' SNAP ', ' Services ', ' health care service organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' health care organization ', ' social organization ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Dietary Assessment ', ' health organization ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' housing instability ', ' unstably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' instably housed ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Impairment ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' primary outcome ', ' social health determinants ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' food environment ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' income disparities ', ' service programs ', ' patient screening ', ' service organization ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' food insecurity ', ' perceived stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,735672,0.08069669682206208
"Health consequences of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program administrative decisions across the monthly SNAP benefit cycle PROJECT SUMMARY  Food security and a healthful diet are important factors in cancer prevention and economic stability. Food insecurity is associated with lower dietary quality, obesity, and poor health outcomes including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer in both adults in children. Likewise, poor diet is associated with obesity and chronic disease. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal program designed with an aim to alleviate food insecurity and improve the diet of those most at risk for an inability to afford sufficient, healthy food. The proposed research aims to understand how the dollar amount of SNAP benefits change recipients’ ability to afford and consume a sufficient and healthful diet across the SNAP benefit month, and to understand which families are most vulnerable and most affected by benefit levels. There are three specific aims of this research: (1) to evaluate the impact of an additional SNAP benefit dollar on ability to purchase sufficient, healthy food across the monthly SNAP benefit cycle, including examining the effect on caloric intake and diet components; (2) to identify the subgroups most impacted by SNAP benefit dollar amount and the monthly SNAP benefit cycle, including by race/ethnicity, female-headed households, and diagnosis of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity; and (3) to compare the effects of an additional SNAP benefit dollar on the monthly SNAP benefit cycle found using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-12 collection wave and the Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey. Methods for primary studies include fixed effects and differences-in-differences frameworks. This research is, to my knowledge, the first to examine the effects of the SNAP benefit amount in the context of both an increase and a decrease in dollar amount due to the same legislation, as well as the first to assess the effects of benefit amount across the month. These questions are key for policy makers and non-profits when targeting cancer prevention efforts. Findings have the potential to inform decisions to better support low-income families in maintaining a sufficient, healthy diet for prevention of chronic disease and reducing cancer risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE Food security and a healthful diet are important factors in cancer prevention and economic stability.

"A multi-component intervention in the hunger relief network to improve diet among adults experiencing food insecurity ABSTRACT  The overarching goal of this application is to evaluate the health impact of an intervention targeting the hunger relief network and the clients with food insecurity it serves. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce nutrition-related health disparities by intervening on a system that serves individuals at high risk for chronic disease. In 2014, an estimated 14% of U.S. households experienced food insecurity (i.e., they lacked access to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members). Large numbers of low-income, racial/ethnic minority, and immigrant families who experience food insecurity rely on a hunger relief network that includes food banks and food pantries. Pantry clients have demonstrated poor nutritional outcomes, high chronic disease rates, and dissatisfaction with the quality and cultural-appropriateness of food offered. Unlike other food assistance programs, there are currently no standards on the nutritional quality of pantry offerings, but recent work by our study team demonstrated the need to improve the healthfulness of hunger relief network inventory. We proposed an evaluation of a randomized, sustainable intervention in 8 intervention and 8 control pantries. We will enroll 272 clients at baseline and follow them for 1 year to assess changes in overall diet quality (the primary outcome). Working with our food bank partners, the intervention at the pantry level targets the supply of nutritious foods, through policy and practice changes and capacity-building. At the client level, the intervention targets healthy food demand, using behavioral economic and educational approaches. Measured outcomes include overall diet quality (the primary outcome), as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI), the nutritional quality of foods selected at the food shelf visit, and cardiovascular disease health (assessed by the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 scores). The study will also evaluate the impact of a multilevel intervention on the nutritional quality of pantry offerings, measured by a Hunger Relief Nutrition Index. The study also aims to improve implementation of policies and practices that promote a nutrition-focused hunger relief network, as assessed by survey and key informant interviews. As an exploratory aim, the study will evaluate the cultural appropriateness of pantry foods and services, given the burden of poor food access on minority, immigrant, and refugee families. After a 1-year needs assessment, an intervention will be conducted in 2 waves in Years 2-3. Years 4-5 will be focused on analysis and local and regional dissemination through channels supported by our partnering agencies. This work capitalizes on a palpable local momentum towards improving the hunger relief system. Research aims address the need for a system- wide approach to improving the hunger relief network and evaluation of its impact on client outcomes. NARRATIVE The hunger safety net fills a critical need among low-income adults with diet-related chronic disease. The challenges faced within the hunger relief network require a multimodal approach for improvement. This study will evaluate the impact of a multicomponent intervention, targeting the supply of healthy food in food pantries and encouraging the selection of healthier items, on client diet and cardiovascular disease risk.",A multi-component intervention in the hunger relief network to improve diet among adults experiencing food insecurity,9672563,R01HL136640,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Behavior ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Client ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Selections ', ' Food Services ', ' Food Supply ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Hunger ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutrition Indexes ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' improved ', ' nutrition education ', ' diet education ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Immigrant ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' cooking ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Palpable ', ' palpable disease ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' food quality ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Food Assistance Programs ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' informant ', ' Minority ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' primary outcome ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' behavioral economics ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' food insecurity ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,708624,0.32212693865208136
"Dietary Quality Indexes and Cancer Risk: the Multiethnic Cohort Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diet quality indexes (DQIs) have been developed to assess dietary patterns, in contrast to a single nutrient or food, by using a hypothesis-oriented methodology. This index-based approach to dietary patterns addresses the complexity of diet, multicollinearity between dietary components, and can be readily translated into dietary recommendations. Recently, we calculated key DQIs for each participant in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC): the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015), the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010), the alternate Mediterranean diet (aMED) score, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, and the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII). Although these indexes have been applied to evaluate the relationship of overall diet to health outcomes including our studies on colorectal cancer in the MEC, there are limited studies addressing racial/ethnic groups other than whites, less common cancers, changes in diet quality over time, and possibility of a novel dietary pattern derived for an ethnically diverse population. To address these gaps, we will utilize the MEC that consists of more than 215,000 adults (55% women) aged 45-75 years; self-reporting as African American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, Latinos, or white; and completed a comprehensive survey including a validated, quantitative food frequency questionnaire (QFFQ) at cohort entry in 1993-1996. The MEC has been periodically linked to tumor registries and death files. In 2003-2007, 46% of the MEC participants completed the repeated QFFQ. The five DQIs are computed for both the baseline and the 10-year follow-up QFFQs. Specific aims to capitalize on these unique data sets include investigate the associations of the five DQIs with risk of 13 common sites of cancer (bladder, breast, endometrium, kidney, liver, lung, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovary, pancreas, prostate, stomach, and thyroid) and the interplay between DQIs in cancer prevention. Next, we will examine the changes in DQIs and their associations with risk of major cancers (breast, colorectum, lung, and prostate) and mortality from all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Our third aim is to develop a novel dietary pattern by exploring DQI components and scoring schemes as well as unique dietary features in the MEC, and validate it by examining its association with cancer risk and mortality. As dietary patterns have not been sufficiently explored for a potential anti-cancer link particularly in racial/ethnic groups other than whites, the proposed work offers a unique opportunity especially for under-studied cancers and racial/ethnic groups. The project will produce a novel dietary pattern for a multiethnic population, and ultimately could influence dietary recommendations and practices for cancer prevention and healthy aging in older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE This application will advance current knowledge on the role of overall diet quality in cancer prevention especially for under-studied cancers and racial/ethnic groups, and the effect of changes in diet quality on subsequent risk of cancer and mortality in older adults. In addition, the project will produce a novel dietary pattern for a multiethnic population, and thus could ultimately influence dietary recommendations and practices for cancer prevention and healthy aging.",Dietary Quality Indexes and Cancer Risk: the Multiethnic Cohort Study,9657290,R03CA223890,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Bladder ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Coffee ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Endometrium ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Japanese American ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' non-Hodgkins disease ', ' Nonhodgkins Lymphoma ', "" Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Ovary ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Pancreas ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' gastric ', ' Stomach ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck ', ' Thyroid ', ' Thyroid Gland ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Colorectal ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' cohort ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' cancer site ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Mediterranean Diet ', ' Address ', ' Dietary Component ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Scheme ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' tumor registry ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Consumption ', ' soy ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' tumor ', ' healthy aging ', ' DASH diet ', ' Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet ', ' Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' anti-cancer ', ' anticancer ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R03,2019,77000,0.08228713064797288
"Cross generational effect of food insecurity: Understanding the relationship between maternal food insecurity and infant feeding choices Project Summary Low-income households, including those of racial and ethnic minority groups, are at higher risk of experiencing food insecurity (FI), or inconsistent access to sufficient quantities of nutritionally adequate food. FI is a significant contributor to health disparities and high obesity rates among adults in the U.S. In this proposal, we seek to understand how FI affects what mothers feed to their infants. Mothers or caretakers, who generally play a key role in managing their household food budgets, buy cheaper foods to maintain satiety and prevent hunger on a limited budget. These cheaper foods are generally high in calories and saturated fats, and low in fiber. Hence, paradoxically, FI and obesity co-exist among caretakers. Although mothers generally govern infant feeding practices, how maternal FI influences feeding choices from early to late infancy is less clear. This is critical because feeding practices determine energy intake and growth rate during infancy, which in turn, predict the risk for obesity. Infants who gain excessive weight during the first year of life are at higher risk of becoming obese children and adults later in life. The overall goal of this longitudinal study is to identify and characterize the relationships between maternal FI, feeding choices and, ultimately, weight gain during infancy. Our central hypothesis is that mothers’ FI or anxiety about food availability, and preoccupation in preventing/managing food shortage and hunger, lead to infant feeding practices that cause high energy intake, cyclical feeding patterns, and ultimately excess weight gain among their infants. To test this hypothesis and achieve our overall goal, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine associations between maternal FI and initiation and intensity of breastfeeding among infants; 2) Determine associations between maternal FI and feeding choices and daily energy intake during infancy; 3) Determine associations between maternal FI and disrupted feeding patterns during infancy, and; 4) Determine associations between maternal FI and rate of weight gain and weight status during infancy. Study participants will be low-income mother-and- infant dyads (n = 240), recruited from the pediatric clinic in the study area. Mothers will be interviewed by trained research staff when their infants are 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months old, to collect information on FI and feeding choices, including daily energy intake among infants. Information will also be collected to assess occurrence of any feeding shortages and inconsistent feeding due to limited availability of formula and other foods. In addition, weight and length of the infants will be retrieved from medical records to estimate rate of weight gain during infancy. The results of this study, targeting low-income and minority mothers and infants, will inform the importance of addressing FI in reducing childhood obesity. Further, this R15 proposal will help to strength the research environment at our institution and provide students with meaningful research experiences. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of the role of food insecurity in predicting infant feeding practices and weight gain trajectory is expected to help control the obesity epidemic, the most wide-spread nutritional disease in the U.S. As a result, this research is relevant to NIH’s mission to reduce the epidemic of obesity and related health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension in the U.S. population.",Cross generational effect of food insecurity: Understanding the relationship between maternal food insecurity and infant feeding choices,9655547,R15HD095261,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Belief ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Breastfed ', ' Breast fed ', ' Budgets ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Generation Effect ', ' Cohort Effect ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Feeding Patterns ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Hunger ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Medical Records ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Perception ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' satiety ', ' Satiation ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Area ', ' Fiber ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' sugar ', ' Life ', ' Calories ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' food shortage ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Toddler ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Academic Research Enhancement Awards ', ' R15 Program ', ' R15 Mechanism ', ' Adherence ', ' Research Training ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' trend ', ' obesity in children ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' child adiposity ', ' feeding ', ' Minority ', ' food security ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk of obesity ', ' risk for obesity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' obesogenic ', ' obesigenic ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' infant adiposity ', ' fetal adiposity ', ' food insecurity ', ' Obesity Epidemic ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA GREENSBORO,R15,2019,436499,0.06335261186433325
"Impact of Navajo Nation Tax on Junk Food 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  2 The Navajo Epidemiology Center manages Navajo public health information systems, and  3 provides data and reports that inform health programming for the over 330,000 enrolled  4 members of the Navajo tribe. Their reports have documented high prevalence of diabetes  5 and obesity, limited availability of healthy traditional foods, and high rates of consumption of  6 sugar sweetened beverages. To address these issues and its consequences, the Navajo  7 Nation passed the Healthy Diné Nation Act (HDNA) in November 2014. The law includes a  8 2% tax on foods of little-to-no-nutritional value (‘junk foods’), the first-ever such tax in the  9 United States. Revenues from the tax are distributed annually to each of the 110 local 10 government entities (chapters) to develop and support local wellness projects. The law was 11 passed with the expectation that the increased cost would impact the food environment, lead 12 to reduced consumption of junk foods and provide a sustainable source of funds to support 13 local needs for wellness programming. 14 To date, however, a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the tax has not been 15 completed. Therefore, the research team, consisting of the Navajo Epidemiology Center, 16 Northern Arizona University and Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital local community 17 affiliate propose to study the impact of the tax on 3 major components: 1) chapter wellness 18 programming supported by tax revenue, 2) changes in the food store environment and 19 pricing following the tax implementation; and 3) changes in sugar sweetened beverage and 20 fruit/vegetable intake following the tax implementation. Chapter wellness programming will be 21 assessed via data from the Division of Community Development, who are supportive of the 22 project. Changes in the food store environment will be assessed via a follow-up of a 2013 23 (pre-tax) survey of 83 stores across the Navajo Nation, which will also identify positive 24 outliers in terms of changes in healthy food offerings. Consumption behaviors will be 25 assessed by conducting a follow-up of the unique Navajo BRFSS, which is a population wide 26 survey following rigorous BRFSS methods. The team has active Navajo IRB protocols to 27 support each aim, and have collaborative support from key stakeholders, positioning us well 28 to deliver on the proposed aims. It is our belief that information from this study is timely, 29 urgent and will be essential for the Navajo Nation leadership to make an informed decision 30 about the continuation of the junk food tax. Project Narrative To address substantial health disparities among the Navajo people, the Navajo Nation passed the 2014 Healthy Diné Nation Act (HDNA), which includes a 2% tax on junk foods. This proposal aims to assess the impact of the junk food tax by utilizing several high quality and culturally specific data sources developed by the Navajo Epidemiology Center. Specifically, we will summarize chapter wellness programming supported by tax revenue, assess changes in the food store environment and behaviors including consumption of sugar- sweetened beverages, fruit and vegetables.",Impact of Navajo Nation Tax on Junk Food,9784905,R01MD013352,"['Arizona ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Data Collection ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Government ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Hospitals ', ' Laws ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Methods ', ' Local Government ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Taxation ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' sugar ', ' Data Quality ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' Navajo ', ' Navaho ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' authority ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Health Information System ', ' member ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Intake ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' cost ', ' consumer demand ', ' tribal Nation ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' food environment ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' Diné Nation ', ' Diné ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,417714,0.26684733529078203
"Sex-based differences in the neuronal mechanisms of food intake behavior Project Summary/Abstract Obesity rates are rapidly rising, as are related health and quality-of-life complications. As such, gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of obesity is critical. Because diet and eating behaviors are core contributors to weight gain, an improved understanding of these processes is required. A key variable in these processes that is currently poorly understood is the effect of sex. Sex- based differences in eating behaviors are consistently observed in both animal and human studies. To date, however, these differences, and their impact on our understanding of the mechanisms of eating behavior, have not been well studied. Failure to study sex effects in this context substantially limits our understanding of these important mechanisms, can result in unnecessary replication of research, and may contribute to problems of reproducibility in clinical research. As such, investigating sex-specific biological processes will lead to a better understanding of underlying mechanisms and will be a critical step in understanding how these mechanisms translate to behavior.  Sex differences in eating behaviors involve a number of factors, such as gonadal hormones, social pressures, and physical activity engagement. These factors also interact with neuronal processes involved in eating behaviors. A clear understanding of sex differences in neuronal mechanisms underlying food intake behaviors has yet to be established. While previous studies have examined sex differences in neuronal response to food cues, results have been inconsistent. Disparities may be due to insufficient sample sizes, lack of menstrual cycle phase consistency, and lack of controlled food intake behavior. Hedonic eating, or eating beyond homeostatic needs, may be particularly associated with obesity. As such, identifying sex differences in neurobiology underlying hedonic eating is of particular relevance. To this end, we recently completed a preliminary investigation of sex differences in neuronal responses to food cues with high (vs. neutral) hedonic value, in both fasted and fed states. Sex differences were observed in the fasted state, with greater responses in women than men in the nucleus accumbens and insula, brain regions with prominent roles in food-related reward processing. This may indicate that women are more sensitive to rewarding aspects of foods when fasted.  The overall goal of this application is to expand on our initial findings to better understand sex-based differences in the neurobiology underlying hedonic eating behaviors and food-based reward processing, how gonadal hormones contribute to these differences, and how this translates to real-life eating behaviors.

"Understanding the risk of obesity in food-insecure children: the hidden role of stress ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food insecurity, a household condition of limited food availability, affects 16 million US children today. Food- insecure children are at risk for adverse diet-related health conditions; however, the mechanisms underlying these associations have not been clearly identified. Chronic, psychological stress may represent an important pathway between food insecurity and childhood obesity. The effects of chronic stress on children's cognitive development and cardio-metabolic health have been well-documented. However, research of the psychological component of food insecurity is sparse. Understanding the psychosocial and cognitive mechanisms underlying children's experiences of food insecurity is important to inform the development of strategies to reduce children's food insecurity and its sequelae. I am pursuing a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award to fill critical training gaps in the areas of stress mechanisms and measurement, children's development of cognitive processes related to overeating, and causal mediation analysis. This award will build upon my advanced training as a nutrition epidemiologist and my prior research on the relations between participation in the federal food programs and diet-related chronic disease. The detailed training plan includes formal coursework at UCSF and UC Berkeley, meetings, seminars, readings, and research apprenticeships. The research component of my project will provide opportunities to integrate knowledge from these new areas. Through the proposed series of studies, I will test the hypothesis that household food insecurity increases children's psychological stress, which shapes their cognitive processes related to eating behaviors and food choice, and predicts subsequent weight gain. First, I will develop a measure to capture children's psychological stress of food insecurity, drawing from qualitative interviews with food-insecure children and existing measures of children's psychological stress. The measure's psychometric properties will be empirically tested in a separate sample of low-income children. Second, in a laboratory setting, I will determine the extent to which children's food insecurity-stress mediates the relationship between household food insecurity and children's cognitive processes related to overeating, using the newly developed measure. Finally, I will design and conduct a two- year longitudinal study to examine associations between household food insecurity and children's weight gain, and the extent to which this is mediated through the proposed pathway. This program of research will focus on children during the transition to adolescence (ages 8-12), a significant period for cognitive development and weight gain with lifelong implications. These findings will highlight a novel and important pathway to explain the adverse effects of food insecurity on children's developmental and diet-related outcomes. The proposed training plan and series of studies will provide me with a set of skills and expertise needed to successfully compete for funding as an independent investigator and to serve as a leader in developing interventions and policies to minimize food insecurity and promote health in low-income children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Food insecurity has been linked with adverse diet-related health outcomes in children; however, the mechanisms underlying these associations are not well-understood. This project will test the hypothesis that household food insecurity promotes children's psychological stress, which shapes their cognitive processes related to eating behaviors and food choice, predicting subsequent weight gain.

"An Exercise Intervention to Improve the Eating Patterns of Preadolescent Children at High Risk for Obesity. 7. Project Summary/Abstract  Children in rural communities experience significant obesity-related health disparities; they are 26%–55% more likely to be obese and less likely to have health insurance and access to weight management specialists than are their urban peers. Geographic-specific disparities in obesity may be due, in part, to variations in energy intake (EI). Children in rural communities describe purchasing and consuming significantly more energy-dense, low-nutrient food items relative to their urban peers. Existing behavioral strategies for improving children's EI patterns have largely been ineffective in reducing risk for excess weight gain. The primary aim of the proposed study is to test the effects of a brief, novel strategy for improving rural children's daily EI. Specifically, the study aims to harness the well-documented benefits of an acute bout (20 min) of moderate physical exercise on children's executive functioning (EF), and to see if these cognitive changes lead to better self-regulation of EI. In a randomized crossover design, 90 preadolescent children (ages 8–10 y; 50% female; 50% obese) will complete two separate conditions (physical activity, sedentary control) on two separate days. In the physical activity condition, children will walk at a moderate pace on a treadmill for 20 min. In the sedentary condition, children will read magazines/books for 20 min. Immediately following each condition, children's EF will be assessed with a brief (3 min) inhibitory control task. EI will then be assessed during a large multi-array buffet test meal. If 20 min of moderate physical exercise is associated with observed improvements in preadolescent children's EI secondary to increases in EF, these data may offer explicit targets for an obesity prevention trial in rural Oregon elementary schools. Such a trial may include introducing 20 min of moderate physical exercise immediately before children's lunchtime food exposure. To begin exploring how experimental, mechanistic data from the proposed study could be scaled up in the natural school environment, qualitative data will also be collected from teachers, staff, and volunteers at an elementary school in rural Oregon as they begin the process of moving recess from immediately after to immediately before lunch. The Active Implementation Frameworks, an evidence-based implementation science tool, will assist with the development of a semi-structured interview to explore the barriers to, and facilitators of, effectively implementing this recess-related change. A team of 11–15 relevant school stakeholders will be approached to discuss organizational fit, need, resources, readiness, and capacity. This approach uses the Active Implementation Frameworks to strengthen the infrastructure for implementing a future effectiveness trial in the local context. A school-based obesity prevention trial in which a brief bout of physical exercise is introduced immediately before lunchtime food exposure would offer diffuse benefits with regard to children's health, well-being, and cognitive functioning; is likely to be well received by parents, staff, and policymakers; and may address significant geographic-related disparities in EI and obesity. 8. Project Narrative  Children in rural communities experience significant obesity-related disparities and report worse eating habits than do their urban peers; as such, novel strategies for improving rural children's eating habits are needed. The proposed study will test the efficacy of a brief bout of moderate physical exercise to increase the executive functioning and subsequent self-regulation of the food consumption of preadolescent children in rural communities. A 20-min physical activity intervention introduced immediately before lunchtime food exposure in rural schools may prompt acute improvements in children's eating habits, thereby reducing their risk for excess weight gain and chronic disease development.",An Exercise Intervention to Improve the Eating Patterns of Preadolescent Children at High Risk for Obesity.,9745677,R21HD094661,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Beverages ', ' Books ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Female ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Oregon ', ' Parents ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Video Games ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Mediating ', ' Rural Community ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' sedentary ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' teacher ', ' Rural ', ' sugar ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' cognitive function ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Pattern ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Palate ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Aerobic ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' obesity in children ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' child adiposity ', ' food consumption ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' obesity prevention ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' scale up ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk of obesity ', ' risk for obesity ', ' volunteer ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive process ', ' exercise intervention ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' treadmill ', ' urban school ', ' rural setting ', ' rural place ', ' rural locality ', ' Child Health ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2019,184375,0.08393747835033492
"Applying Innovative Approaches to Design and Implement an Intervention to Improve Cardiovascular Health in Hispanic/Latino communities through Restaurants The overall goal of this application is to provide the candidate, Melissa Fuster, Ph.D., essential training to transition into an independent researcher promoting nutrition and cardiovascular health in Hispanic communities through innovative, evidence-based environmental interventions and policies. The proposed project responds to the critical need to improve diet quality and cardiovascular health among Hispanic Caribbean communities using innovative approaches. While most nutrition interventions target individual behaviors, there is a pressing need to create environments that support healthy food choices. Restaurants can be a vehicle to facilitate this change, given the growing importance of foods consumed away from home. Working with an interdisciplinary and multi- sectoral team of mentors and collaborators, Dr. Fuster will apply a theory-based framework from Implementation Sciences to develop and test the Hispanic Caribbean Restaurants in Action (HCRiA) initiative, an intervention to improve nutrition environments in Puerto Rican and Dominican restaurants. Addressing the complex and dynamic nature of restaurant environments, the study complements the theoretical framework with approaches from systems science and human-centered design. These approaches facilitate the engagement of restaurant stakeholders (owners, cooks, and wait-staff) to identify and solve barriers preventing healthier eating behaviors in restaurants. Aim 1 will use a participatory group discussion technique from systems science to characterize customer and restaurant-level factors that facilitate and hinder healthy nutrition environments in HC restaurants. Aim 2 will apply the Behavioral Change Wheel (Implementation Sciences theoretical framework) and human- centered design approaches to engage restaurant stakeholders (owners, staff, and customers) in the design of the HCRiA initiative. Aim 3 will use a mixed-method, quasi-experimental design to pilot test the resulting intervention in a total of four restaurants. Research activities will be intertwined with coursework and mentorship to further development in the following critical training areas: (1) Human-Centered Design and Systems Science, (2) Implementation Science, (3) Quasi-experimental methods, and (4) Large-scale project and grant development. This K01 project contributes public health approaches to improve food environments to ameliorate diet-related health disparities, and the application of implementation science to tackle an important evidence- practice gap, where evidence-based dietary patterns to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease are not being practiced at the community level. The completion of the proposed plan will provide a solid base to successfully compete for R01-level funding for a full-scale community trial of the HCRiA initiative, bolster the applicant’s publication record through dissemination activities among researchers and the community, and augment diversity among nutrition researchers. The persistent nature of diet-related issues, such as cardiovascular disease, necessitate new ways to promote and facilitate healthful eating behaviors, through improvements in community environments including restaurants. This proposal aims to apply theoretical framework from Implementation Science combined with Systems Science and Human-Centered Design approaches to guide the design of an innovative, stakeholder engaged intervention in Hispanic Caribbean restaurants to improve the diet quality and cardiovascular health in the Caribbean Hispanic/Latino community, which presents high risks of diet-related factors contributing to cardiovascular disease. The findings from this study will contribute to improving food environments in diverse communities, as lessons learned from the Hispanic Caribbean experience can be applied to address the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and other diet-related conditions among Hispanics/Latinos (the largest minority group in the United States) and other minority groups in the United States.",Applying Innovative Approaches to Design and Implement an Intervention to Improve Cardiovascular Health in Hispanic/Latino communities through Restaurants,9800381,K01HL147882,"['American Heart Association ', ' Behavior ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' Latin America ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' nutrition ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Restaurants ', ' Sales ', ' Science ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' salt ', ' Sodium Chloride ', ' Testing ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' United States ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Vegetables ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Research Activity ', ' Food Policy ', ' Funding ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Environmental Policy ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' cooking ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Calories ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' behavior change ', ' Supermarket ', ' experience ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' Participant ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Melissa ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dominican ', ' Address ', ' Cooking Practices ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Intake ', ' Community Trial ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' food consumption ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' environmental intervention ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' food environment ', ' public health intervention ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' model building ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' Caribbean Hispanic ', ' Latin American ', ' Cuban ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NHLBI,BROOKLYN COLLEGE,K01,2019,160906,0.13378568736073776
"Understanding & Overcoming Food Insecurity in Diabetes Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food insecurity, defined as difficulty affording an adequate diet owing to cost, affects over 20% of the 29 million Americans with diabetes. Food insecurity is an important socioeconomic barrier to effective diabetes care: it is associated with worse diabetes control and increased emergency department visits and hospitalization. By incentivizing consumption of calorie-dense foods high in simple carbohydrates and saturated fats, instead of more expensive fresh produce and whole grains, food insecurity may undermine healthy diets that are crucial for diabetes management. This project will help advance our knowledge of the relationship between food insecurity and diabetes by identifying how food insecurity affects current diabetes management and examining the clinical effects of using different strategies to overcome it. Fundamental questions regarding the mechanisms underlying potential interventions remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To determine the impact of food insecurity on a lifestyle change intervention: the REAL HEALTH Diabetes trial (R18 DK102737 NCT02320253), a pragmatic adaptation of the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention to community health centers, 2)To estimate the effect of nutrition assistance program use on diabetes control for patients in a primary care network, and 3) To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility of home-delivered medically tailored meals for food insecure diabetes patients with hyperglycemia. This research program complements the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' strategic focus on translating clinical research to practice by overcoming barriers faced by patients in real-world settings, reducing disparities in special populations, making care more patient-centered, and innovating within systems of care. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in understanding how socioeconomic barriers affect diabetes management and pragmatic interventions to overcome them. Career development activities include training in advanced analytic methods and intervention design through formal coursework as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will fill important knowledge gaps, and help improve diabetes management and reduce diabetes complications in patients with food insecurity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Over 29 million Americans have diabetes, and 1 in 5, nearly 6 million, report food insecurity, or difficulty accessing nutritious food owing to cost. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of the role food insecurity plays in diabetes management, and assess 2 strategies to address food insecurity in diabetes patients: 1) improving food access using nutritional assistance programs, and 2) directly providing medically tailored meals.

"A large-scale, long-term, randomized trial of nutrition labeling interventions PROJECT SUMMARY Poor dietary habits are associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. Government and institutional policy makers worldwide are interested in food labeling and messaging as a cost-effective strategy to encourage healthier food choices. Although there is evidence that nutrition labels can influence behavior, it is unclear which label designs are most effective at altering behavior for people with different levels of education. There are three common types of nutrition labels: a single logo highlighting healthier choices, traffic light labels, or physical activity labels that translate calorie information into exercise required to burn off the calories. Because there have been no large-scale, long-term randomized trials comparing the effect of these labels on behavior, the relative impact of these labeling schemes is unknown. Such rigorous evaluations are needed so policy makers do not have to guess. The overall objective of this application is to compare four theoretically-informed nutrition label designs in the first long-term, large-scale randomized trial of nutrition messages. The study will be conducted in partnership with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health which will enable us to randomize 267 (107 snack and 160 beverage) vending machines to different nutrition label messages. Beverage machines will be randomized to one of the following four conditions: 1) A single green traffic light label next to items meeting a “healthy” threshold; 2) a multiple traffic light label that displays red, yellow, or green labels to indicate options that range from less to more healthy; 3) a physical activity label that indicates the number of minutes one would have to walk to burn off the calories in each food or beverage; or 4) tax-related messaging (Philadelphia implemented a 1.5 cents per ounce beverage tax in January 2017). Snack machines will be randomized to the same conditions except for the tax messaging, which does not apply to foods. We will use vending machine transaction data over three years to compare the influence each label has on average calories and percentage of healthy and less healthy items purchased as well as impact on sales. We will also conduct interviews with 2,916 vending machine patrons to evaluate whether education level and other factors moderate message influence. This study will provide valuable data to fill research gaps and inform policy makers’ efforts to use nutrition labeling and messaging as a public health approach to encourage healthier choices and address health disparities. !

"Diet and Health Behavior Change to Improve Bone Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sabrina Noel, PhD, RD is currently a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. She has advanced training in nutrition and epidemiology and experience working in both clinical and community settings. Dr. Noel's experience with diet and metabolic health research, and exposure to work with disparities in bone health, has encouraged her to pursue a career in population-based bone research. Her goal is to evaluate the effects of dietary quality on bone health and to develop a culturally and literacy-tailored behavior change intervention targeting dietary and physical activity behaviors among Caribbean Hispanic adults. In contrast to what has been earlier believed, Hispanics have recently been shown to have higher prevalence of osteoporosis, compared with non-Hispanic whites; however, most of this research has focused on Mexican Americans because of their majority status in the U.S. Hispanic population. Caribbean origin Hispanics are one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. population and are underrepresented in bone- related research. Preliminary data from a large study of Puerto Rican adults in Boston, MA, indicates that Caribbean Hispanics are at higher risk for osteoporosis than previously thought. Identifying modifiable health behaviors, such as diet and physical activity, to prevent bone loss is an important public health priority, as adherence to bone medications is generally poor. Increasing evidence suggests that overall dietary quality is critical for bone health; however, studies that use predefined dietary patterns as a measure of overall dietary quality have reported inconsistent associations with bone outcomes. This is likely due to the fact that nutrients and foods known to be important for bone are underrepresented in these existing indices. We, therefore, propose to develop a bone-specific dietary quality index with nationally based data, and to then adapt it to include ethnic (Caribbean Latino) specific food choices related to bone health. Few theory-based interventions have targeted both dietary and physical activity behaviors to promote bone health and none that we know of have focused on overall dietary quality or on Caribbean origin Hispanic adults. This K01 award will provide Dr. Noel with training and research experience in bone health and osteoporosis prevention, health behavior theory, behavioral intervention design, implementation and evaluation, and advanced biostatistics. This training will help Dr. Noel achieve her long-term career goals of becoming a leading independent investigator in nutrition and bone health with expertise in designing and conducting culturally tailored behavioral interventions to improve bone health in diverse populations. Dr. Noel's mentors are highly committed to her career development and future success and will help her build additional knowledge and skills in bone health and intervention research. Dr. Noel's proposed research aims are to: 1) develop a bone-specific dietary quality index that emphasizes specific foods and nutrients known to be important for bone; and to evaluate the effects of a resulting dietary quality score on bone health using national survey data; 2) to adapt the index to include ethnic-specific food choices of Caribbean origin Hispanics, using data from an existing study of Puerto Rican adults, to guide the dietary component of a lifestyle behavior change intervention and; 3) to adapt and pilot test the feasibility and preliminary impact of a theory-based cultural and literacy-tailored intervention to improve dietary and physical activity behaviors among 60 Caribbean origin Hispanic adults. This bone-focused intervention will be modeled after another unique behavioral intervention, which successfully improved dietary quality and other health behaviors in low-income Caribbean Latinos. Innovative strategies, including narrative forms of communication, will be employed to help individuals adopt healthy behaviors. This work will inform a larger scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the behavioral intervention on bone outcomes in Caribbean Hispanics.

"Community-Based Dietary Approach for Hypertensive African Americans with Chronic Kidney Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) when compared to whites. Racial disparities are most profound among persons of low socioeconomic status (SES) and dietary factors likely underlie much of this disparity. Low SES AAs are more likely to experience food insecurity and live in ""food deserts"" and are less likely to follow a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordant diet than are whites. This is despite evidence that adherence to the DASH diet may have greater blood pressure benefit for AAs than whites, and evidence that the DASH diet may slow CKD progression (including reductions in urine albumin excretion). We propose to build upon encouraging results of our pilot study, ""The Five-Plus Nuts and Beans Trial"", which was conducted as a partnership between Johns Hopkins investigators, a community supermarket, the Baltimore City Health Department's ""Virtual Supermarket"" program, a community-based clinic and a highly engaged Community Advisory Board. This randomized trial tested the effects of a dietary approach to increase consumption of a central feature of the DASH diet--high potassium foods. A total of 123 AA patients with controlled hypertension, and recruited from a community-based clinic, were provided personalized dietary advice, assistance with grocery ordering and delivery, and $30 per week worth of high potassium foods for an 8-week period. With this approach, we demonstrated statistically significant increases in consumption of fruits, vegetables, potassium, magnesium and fiber, and decreases in sodium intake. Also, there was a 14% reduction in urinary albumin excretion overall, and a 30% reduction among patients with significant albuminuria at enrollment. In this application, we propose a larger (n=150) and longer (1 year) trial of a dietary intervention in AAs with hypertension (controlled or uncontrolled) plus mild/moderate CKD-a population at very high risk of the adverse effects of poor diets. The primary aim, in the setting of a randomized trial, is to test the hypothesis that delivery of nutritional advice to adopt the DASH diet and $30 per week worth of potassium-rich foods, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores of patients recruited from community-based clinics, will reduce blood pressure and reduce urinary albumin excretion in low SES AAs with hypertension and CKD. Strengths of our proposal include the integration of an experienced, highly collaborative team of investigators with expertise in clinical trials, nephrology, health disparities, community-based participatory research, integration of trials into primary care practices, and statistical analyses The investigation team includes a highly involved Community Advisory Board, and has an established close partnership with Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, the Baltimore City Health Department and local supermarkets. If our hypothesis is correct, then our trial will establish an immediately translatable, inexpensive, and safe approach for adjuvant therapy in the treatment of hypertension and kidney damage (albuminuria) among low SES AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are disproportionately affected by hypertension and kidney disease in the United States, and these disparities are particularly apparent among socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans. Limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy diets likely contribute to these disparities. In this community-based randomized clinical trial, we will test whether delivering nutritional advice to adopt the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and $30 per week worth of fruits and vegetables, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores, will reduce blood pressure and kidney damage in socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans with

"A Systems Science Approach to Understanding Racial/Ethnic Dispartities in Obesity ABSTRACT Identifying effective strategies for reducing obesity is critical for alleviating the unequal burden of obesity and related adverse cardiopulmonary and sleep outcomes facing black and Hispanic women in the U.S. Studies typically focus on identifying independent effects of individual and environmental factors on obesity, but this approach overlooks important inter-relationships between these factors. This is challenging to model using traditional regression modeling approaches which are not well equipped to handle the complex ways individuals interact with their environments. Systems science approaches were promoted in two recent reports released by the Institute of Medicine and are part of the NHLBI Strategic Research Priorities because predictive and simulation-based models can both elucidate the complex inter-relationships between social, economic, and environmental causes of poor health and assess the benefits and harms of policy and intervention options. Thus, the overall goal of this application is to use a systems science methodology, agent- based modeling, to understand how individual-level behaviors and psychosocial factors interact with characteristics of the food environment to influence eating behaviors and obesity. This goal will be accomplished by executing the following aims: 1) to examine associations of food store characteristics with body mass index among Hispanic, black and white women; 2) to develop an exploratory agent-based model that simulates the emergence of racial/ethnic disparities in obesity among women; and 3) to investigate the effectiveness of potential multi-level interventions to reduce obesity. The candidate, Kiarri Kershaw, is an Assistant Professor of Preventive Medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Her strong training in general epidemiology, social epidemiology, and population health has allowed her to pursue a research agenda focused on racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and place-based disparities in cardiovascular disease risk factors. The K01 award will allow her to build on her current training by providing her with protected time to collect data on factors that influence lifestyle choices and to build and test an initial agent- based simulation. It will also allow her to learn how to work with community stakeholders and policymakers in order to develop research studies with a greater potential to translate into public health improvements. This training will help Dr. Kershaw achieve her long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program that focuses on how inter-relationships between individuals and their environments influence disparities in CVD risk. RELEVANCE: The results of this research project and future studies will allow for the development of effective, comprehensive multi-level interventions to promote cardiovascular health by reducing racial/ethnic disparities in obesity. Specifically, the execution of these aims will lead to an improved understanding of the dynamic inter-relationships between individuals and their environments that contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in eating behaviors and obesity.",A Systems Science Approach to Understanding Racial/Ethnic Dispartities in Obesity,9716649,K01HL133531,"['Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Local Government ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' tool ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' Physical environment ', ' professor ', ' Nutrient ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' systematic review ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population health ', ' food environment ', ' public health intervention ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Data Analytics ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2019,133747,0.04161319743019387
"Effectiveness and Implementation of a Research Tested Mobile Produce Market Designed to Improve Diet in Underserved Communities Abstract Lower-income and minority groups face significant health disparities with respect to obesity, cancer, heart disease and other diet-related chronic conditions. Poor diets, low in fruits and vegetables (F&V) and high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar, contribute to many of the health problems faced by vulnerable groups. While socioeconomic status and other individual level factors (i.e., food preferences, time and skills to prepare healthy food, etc.) can lead to reduced F&V consumption, these must be viewed in an environmental context. Compared with higher-income neighborhoods, lower-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to have stores that sell a variety of F&V and other healthy foods. And when stores are available, produce may not be affordable, high quality or culturally appropriate. Farmers' markets and mobile produce markets (MM) have become increasingly popular strategies to alleviate food access concerns in underserved communities. However, it is unclear if these programs have the necessary components to have an appreciable impact on diet. Our research team recently completed one of the first randomized controlled trials of a MM program called the Veggie Van. Veggie Van was run in partnership with our team and a small non-profit organization in North Carolina; it delivered boxes of fresh, locally grown produce and food-focused education to communities with significant barriers to F&V consumption including availability, affordability, quality and knowledge. In this small cluster-randomized trial in 12 communities (N=201), we saw impressive changes in F&V intake with intervention participants eating almost 1 more cups per day of F&Vs than the control group. Intervention participants also reported increases in perceived access to healthy foods and Veggie Van customers attributed many dietary changes to the MM program. While these results are very promising, we believe it is important to test the effectiveness of the Veggie Van program when implemented by different organizations in multiple communities. If shown to be effective, we can create a research-tested intervention toolkit which can be disseminated to communities across the country. For this research, we will use a request for proposals process to identify 8 organizations nationwide that are well-qualified to implement the Veggie Van model. Organizations will identify appropriate sites for MM deliveries (32 total) and we will randomize them to either an implementation or planning condition. With the help of our team's technical assistance and provided funding, partner organizations will engage community members in the process and initiate a MM program. We will use a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation to measure effectiveness (diet, BMI, dermal carotenoids) and implementation (customer reach and sales, process measures, qualitative interviews with MM staff). We will also examine sustainability of MM financial models and determine implementation standards (i.e., dose needed to maintain impact) for inclusion in our MM toolkit for future dissemination. Narrative Our research demonstrated that a mobile produce market can have a significant positive impact on diets of residents in lower-income communities. We want to test this program more widely to determine if the effect can be replicated and develop a best-practices toolkit to help others sustainably implement the program.",Effectiveness and Implementation of a Research Tested Mobile Produce Market Designed to Improve Diet in Underserved Communities,9613802,R37CA215232,"['Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' carotenoid biosynthesis ', ' Carotenes and Carotenoids ', ' Carotenoids ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Feedback ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Fingers ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Preferences ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Housing ', ' Hybrids ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Marketing ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' North Carolina ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Sales ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Businesses ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Process Measure ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' nutrition education ', ' diet education ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Dermal ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Measurement ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' cooking ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Height ', ' community college ', ' two year college ', ' junior college ', ' 2 year college ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Intake ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Update ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' informant ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' environmental intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' food environment ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' farmers markets ', ' recruit ', ' intervention participants ', ' ']",NCI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R37,2019,619033,0.14230308074101566
"A pragmatic randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of medically tailored meals and medical nutrition therapy via telehealth among patients with poorly controlled diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the availability of evidence-based guidance and treatments, many patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) do not achieve optimal glycemic control. In prior work, patients with DM identified primary needs of improved access to food and nutrition education. Several innovative models for food services have emerged to address patient needs for improved healthy food access. Currently, select non-profit organizations across the U.S. deliver millions of medically-tailored meals (MTM) to patients with chronic illnesses, based on the premise that food can be as helpful as medicine in improving patient outcomes. While a handful of pilot studies have demonstrated success of MTM in reducing healthcare utilization and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) among patients with DM, no randomized trials have assessed the sustained impact of MTM on long-term outcomes for patients with DM. Similarly, individual studies of medical nutrition therapy (MNT), which includes individualized nutrition education and counseling, have shown benefit for improving DM outcomes. However, uptake of MNT across health systems has historically been extremely limited because of patient logistical barriers to attending the in- person visits. MNT delivered by telehealth (tele-MNT) has potential to overcome these barriers. Our goal is to evaluate the effect of MTM, with and without additional tele-MNT, on outcomes for patients with poorly controlled type 2 DM. We will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with patients who have poorly controlled DM. Outcomes of interest include change in HbA1c, cost effectiveness, weight, diabetes self- efficacy, self-care, diabetes quality of life, and patient satisfaction. We will assess the efficacy of 1) MTM and 2) MTM + tele-MNT compared to usual care in reducing HbA1c at 3, 6 (primary outcome) and 12 months and the cost effectiveness of each intervention compared to usual care up to 12 months. We will also explore patient perspectives regarding experiences with MTM and MTM + tele-MNT to gain a better understanding of potential factors contributing to treatment failure and success within each group. The proposed research is innovative because it develops and tests a novel tele-MNT intervention tailored to recipients of MTM, provides a comprehensive solution to patient-identified nutrition needs, includes complete utilization data provided by the HealthShare Exchange, and leverages a unique health system and community group partnership to improve sustainability and scalability. Study results will inform 1) provider and payor decisions regarding offering and covering these services; 2) how services should be structured for scalability; and 3) integration of these services into the larger care delivery system to reduce DM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE This pragmatic randomized controlled trial will assess the efficacy of medically tailored meals and medical nutrition therapy via telehealth on clinical outcomes for patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The goal of these interventions is to improve outcomes for patients with diabetes by impacting self-care behaviors and diet self-efficacy in the short and long term. This study leverages a unique health system and community group partnership to inform the utility of reimbursement for medically tailored meal programs and medical nutrition therapy, which would ultimately facilitate their scalability and sustainability within the healthcare system.",A pragmatic randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of medically tailored meals and medical nutrition therapy via telehealth among patients with poorly controlled diabetes,9816297,R18DK118590,"['Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Services ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' nutrition ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Schedule ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' nutrition education ', ' diet education ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Logistics ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Medical Nutrition Therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' telehealth ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Diet and Nutrition ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Food Access ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' routine practice ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' care costs ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' patient barriers ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' ']",NIDDK,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R18,2019,668157,0.09862558046595973
"Social networks, acculturation, and food behaviors and values among Mexican-American families PROJECT SUMMARY The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is two to three times higher among Mexican Americans than non-Latino whites, and Mexican Americans are more likely to develop diabetes at younger ages and suffer higher rates of complications. Many of these complications could be reduced substantially by targeting health behaviors such as diet and exercise; however, research has shown that, for Mexican Americans, healthful diet-related behaviors, as well as obesity prevalence, decrease with greater acculturation, including years in the U.S. or English-language adoption. Social networks play an important role in obesity and diet through social support, access to resources, social engagement, and social norms. However, an important and unanswered question is the extent to which less-healthy food behaviors and values are diffused across social networks among Mexican Americans and whether the diffusion of food behaviors and values differs by acculturation status. The goal of this proposal, in response to PAR-16-064 `Small Grants for New Investigators to Promote Diversity in Health-Research (R21),' is to examine the influence of the personal social networks of Mexican American families on food behaviors and values as well as objectively measured health outcomes (i.e., hbA1c and BMI). This project will build on our ongoing collaborations large Catholic churches in Los Angeles and New York by examining two specific aims: (1) To quantitatively characterize the personal networks of English-dominant and Spanish-dominant Mexican American families and test the network characteristics that are associated with unhealthful eating patterns, diabetes, and obesity and (2) To qualitatively explore how social networks influence English-dominant and Spanish-dominant Mexican American families' food behaviors and values. We will explore group differences in social networks between 81 Spanish-dominant and 81 English-dominant Mexican-American adults attending Sunday services at large Catholic churches. We will then select 25 information-rich cases for in-depth interviews and ethnographic observations, which will allow us to gain insights into food behaviors and values that may be socially transmitted. This study will provide preliminary data to develop an R34 application targeting specific social network features that influence diabetes-related behaviors among this vulnerable population.

"A natural experiment evaluating the effect of a minimum wage increase on obesity and diet-related outcome Minimum wage laws are increasingly being recognized as a possible policy lever for improving population health and health equity, with the potential for implementation at the local, state, and national levels. On June 30, 2017, Minneapolis, Minnesota became the 40th local jurisdiction to set the minimum wage above the state level. The city will incrementally increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by July 1, 2022 for all firms with greater than 100 employees; minimum wage in smaller firms will increase to $13.50 during this time period. The ordinance is expected to increase wages among the 71,000 workers likely to be affected, who are disproportionately non-Hispanic black and Hispanic workers. The available evidence suggests that minimum wage laws may be associated with a range of health outcomes. This includes obesity, as increasing wages can improve food security and reduce cost constraints for purchasing healthier foods. However, existing studies linking wages and weight have design weaknesses that limit causal inference and the ability to identify causal mechanisms. This study, which has a prospective quasi-experimental design with a strong counterfactual condition, is the next step for testing whether and how an increase in minimum wage results in improved obesity-related outcomes among low-wage workers. Throughout the 4.5-year implementation of the Minneapolis minimum wage ordinance, we will follow a cohort of low-wage workers (those earning less than $10 an hour at baseline) in a natural experiment, using a difference-in-difference design to compare a panel of obesity-related measures in a cohort of low-wage workers in Minneapolis (n = 400) and similar workers in a matched control community (n = 400), Raleigh, NC. The control city has a statewide preemption law which prohibits local minimum wage increases. Measures for all individuals will be collected at baseline (T0) and after 5 incremental wage increases (T1-T5) through June 2022. The study aims to test the difference in change in body mass index (BMI, the primary outcome) between individuals in the two conditions, as assessed by anthropometric height-weight measurements. We will also test the difference in change in the two conditions for a range of nutrition-related outcomes, including purchases of healthier and less healthy foods (measured by food purchase receipts), food insecurity (measured by a 6-item USDA measure), and participation in government food assistance programs (measured by participant survey). Finally, we will test other behavioral and psychosocial mechanisms through which wages might affect obesity, and explore spending changes in household health-related expenses over time. Minimum wage laws are a potential upstream approach to prevent obesity, and these policies may be uniquely positioned to reduce health disparities because they intervene on a population (lower-income, high racial/ethnic minority) at the highest risk for poor health. This natural experiment offers a time-sensitive opportunity to test policy effects and contribute a rare health-oriented perspective to the national discourse around the effects of an economic policy. NARRATIVE At present, millions of workers in the United States earn the federal minimum wage of $7.25 or less. Low-income individuals are at an increased risk for obesity and related chronic diseases; raising the minimum wage has the potential to affect obesity by reducing many of its risk factors. In this R01, we will test the effect of an increase in the local minimum wage on changes in obesity-related risk over 5 years.",A natural experiment evaluating the effect of a minimum wage increase on obesity and diet-related outcome,9640440,R01DK118664,"['Affect ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Expenditure ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Laws ', ' Minnesota ', ' North Carolina ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Step Tests ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Economic Policy ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' Hour ', ' S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine ', ' SNAP ', ' Height ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Employee ', ' preempt ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Food Assistance Programs ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Behavioral ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' food security ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk of obesity ', ' risk for obesity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' health equity ', ' population health ', ' Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ', ' Women, Infants and Children (WIC) ', ' WIC program ', ' WIC ', ' food insecurity ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,688728,0.09870352892570088
"Appalachians Together Restoring the Eating Environment (Appal-TREE): Advancing Sustainable CBPR Interventions to Improve Healthy Diet in Rural Appalachian Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The National Institutes of Health has acknowledged that residents of rural Appalachia experience among the nation's worst health and economic profiles, including disability and premature mortality stemming from elevated rates of heart disease and stroke, various cancers, diabetes, all of which are closely associated with suboptimal dietary intake, obesity, and overweight. Community members are particularly concerned about their children, who have among the highest rates of obesity, overweight, and suboptimal dietary intake in the nation. Eliminating these health disparities requires scientificaly informed community-engaged research to develop and evaluate innovative and sustainable programs and policies. For the proposed application, our community-research team will (1) use an innovative information technology CBPR method - Structured Public Involvement - to refine and tailor a package of pilot tested healthy eating interventions; (2) conduct and evaluate this package of interventions that were found to be feasible, culturally consonant, and promising during R24MD008018 and (3) build community capacity in social marketing, an innovative approach to enhance sustainability of the intervention. Our partners include the Community Farm Alliance, local school districts, the Cooperative Extension Service, and other community organizations. For the first aim, the innovative CBPR approach Structured Public Involvement will allow us to tailor the intervention while maintaining project fidelity. For the second aim, we will administer and evaluate three interrelated interventions to transform access to and intake of healthy foods for Appalachian children; (1) a school-based water campaign to decrease sugar sweetened beverage consumption (2) healthy cooking classes to encourage healthy cooking on a budget; and (3).a farmer's market-based healthy summer feeding program. Finally, in Aim 3, we will administer a CBPR-oriented approach, social marketing, to enhance sustainability, a challenge for all behavioral interventions. Through the schools, we will train teachers and administrators to teach social marketing to students, who will be encouraged to develop marketing campaigns supporting healthy diets. All of these efforts will be developed, implemented, and evaluated in conjunction with our Community Advisory Boards. As one of our local stakeholders told us, ""If you really are what you eat, it's no wonder so many of us are unhealthy."" By developing sustainable, evidence-based programming, we aim to transform consumption patterns and the eating environment so the next generation of rural residents can overcome pernicious health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Appalachians Together Restoring the Eating Environment (Appal-TREE) uses a new CBPR technology to solicit community input, delivers a tested package of healthy diet interventions (water promotion, cooking classes, and expansion of the Summer Food Service Program via farmers markets) to Appalachian communities.

"Testing combinations of population interventions to encourage healthy eating ABSTRACT Population-level interventions to encourage healthy eating—which involve changing food environments or purchasing conditions—have been extensively discussed for the prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Preliminary data suggest that population interventions introduced in isolation (such as an SSB tax) can have a modest effect, but multi-faceted interventions should be introduced in combination, to produce large and meaningful improvements in healthy eating. Studying combinations of population interventions is difficult, as such interventions are rare. We propose to rigorously assess a rare set of nested natural experiments in the two largest, most diverse urban settings in California (CA): Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. We will identify the complementarities among major population-level interventions to encourage healthy eating. In Aim 1, we will conduct a prospective evaluation of a population-wide SSB tax in both tax-affected and matched unaffected CA counties. We will identify changes to both beverage and food consumption and purchasing, food substitution patterns, spillover to neighboring areas, effects of marketing, and any regressive economic effects for low-income populations. The longer-term follow-up period enabled by our design will test the hypothesis that a SSB tax produces sustained declines in SSB consumption rather than merely short-term effects followed by a return to pre-tax consumption. Uniquely, we will then test complementarity between the tax and other interventions in Aims 2 and 3. In Aim 2, we will examine the complementarity of the SSB tax with a fruit and vegetable voucher program. Some SSB tax-affected and distant tax-unaffected counties have introduced fresh fruit and vegetable purchasing vouchers, which enable low-income families facing food insecurity to purchase fruits and vegetables at major supermarkets and corner stores in the area, not just at farmer’s markets. We will test the hypothesis, supported by our preliminary data, that pairing the purchasing penalty of an SSB tax with a purchasing incentive of a fruit and vegetable voucher improves upon the modest effect of either intervention alone. In Aim 3, we will identify the complementarity between the SSB tax and a workplace SSB purchasing ban, implemented in some workplaces but not others during tax-affected and -unaffected periods. We will test the hypothesis, consistent with our preliminary data, that workplace bans disproportionately reduce SSB consumption in the lowest-income employees, neutralizing the economically-regressive effect of a SSB tax. We will evaluate these interventions using innovative methods that advance the study of natural experiments in obesity and diabetes prevention. Specifically, we will use a synthetic control statistical method, which adjusts for unmeasured confounders such as differences in culture among the intervention and control areas. Second, we will input our results into validated computer simulation models of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, allowing us to project the generalizable impact and cost-effectiveness of the interventions for reducing long-term national race/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Population-level interventions to encourage healthy eating—which often involve changing food environments or purchasing conditions—have been extensively discussed for the prevention of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Current theory suggests that to significantly reduce such diseases at a population level, multi-faceted interventions should be introduced in combination, but such combinations are challenging to study given their rarity. We propose to rigorously assess multiple natural experiments in well-matched populations, fulfilling a strategic NIH goal to understand what interventions in combination can lead to population-wide reductions in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.",Testing combinations of population interventions to encourage healthy eating,9724461,R01DK116852,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Beverages ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Demography ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incentives ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Sales ', ' San Francisco ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Smoking ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' Calories ', ' Frequencies ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Supermarket ', ' Employee ', ' novel ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' theories ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Intake ', ' Population Intervention ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' food consumption ', ' obesity prevention ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' food environment ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' lower income families ', ' farmers markets ', ' urban setting ', ' food insecurity ', ' ']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,680844,0.12057095732386269
"Impact of Disparities in Food Security on Glycemic Control and Health Care Utilization Among Youth and Young Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Despite recent advances in therapy, far too many youth and young adults (YYAs) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly those of minority race/ethnicity, do not achieve optimal glycemic control thus placing them at increased risk of acute and chronic complications. Among the social determinants of health, household food insecurity (HFI) may be a key barrier to achieving glycemic control and may lead to increased health care utilization and costs, but virtually all of the limited research was cross-sectional and conducted in older adults with T2D. Moreover, racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by HFI, which may underlie similar disparities in diabetes outcomes. Our preliminary work suggests that HFI is a common phenomenon in YYAs with diabetes, affecting 19% of YYAs with T1D and 38% of those with T2D. These rates significantly exceed the 2015 national estimate of 12.7%. We propose a longitudinal study, the SEARCH Food Security (SFS) cohort study, which is designed as an ancillary study to the ongoing CDC/DDT- and NIH/NIDDK-funded SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth 4 study, a racially/ethnically diverse study of diabetes diagnosed in youth. The aims of the SFS study are to: (1) Initiate a food insecurity cohort study of 1,187 YYAs aged 15-35 years (53% minority) with T1D and T2D by adding two data collection time points to the ongoing SEARCH 4 study; (2) Prospectively evaluate the influence of HFI on changes in glycemic control in YYAs with T1D and T2D; (3) Quantify the mediating role of nutritional, mental health, and behavioral pathways through which food insecurity may affect changes in glycemic control in YYAs with T1D and T2D; and (4) Prospectively evaluate the influence of HFI on changes in health care utilization and medical and non-medical health care costs in YYAs with T1D and T2D. Using the SFS data in tandem with extensive data collected by SEARCH will be highly efficient for addressing these aims. The proposed study will be the first cohort study to examine the impact of food insecurity on glycemic control, health care utilization, and costs among a diverse population of US YYAs with T1D and T2D. Our transdisciplinary team is led by Drs. Liese and Mendoza, recognized experts in diabetes, epidemiology, pediatric medicine, disparities, and food insecurity research, and is supported by a team comprising expertise in pediatric endocrinology, psychology, health behaviors, health economics, biostatistics, and causal inference modeling. The study has the potential to alter diabetes policy and clinical practice by establishing the need for more in-depth assessments of food insecurity among YYAs with diabetes, re-assessment of diabetes management and nutrition recommendations for food-insecure patients, and integration of food assistance resources into routine care for persons with diabetes. It will also inform the tailoring of interventions to address food insecurity, especially for minorities, in future diabetes research trials. NARRATIVE Good glycemic control is important for optimal health and prevention of acute and chronic complications among people living with diabetes but food insecurity seems to be a serious barrier to achieving good glycemic control, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. This is the first longitudinal study that will characterize the mechanisms by which food insecurity affects glycemic control and the impact it has on health care utilization and medical and non-medical health care cost in youth and young adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",Impact of Disparities in Food Security on Glycemic Control and Health Care Utilization Among Youth and Young Adults with Diabetes,9673123,R01DK117461,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Buffers ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type one diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes nutrition ', ' Diabetic Diet ', ' diabetic ketoacidotic ', ' Diabetic Ketosis ', ' Diabetic Acidosis ', ' Diabetic Ketoacidosis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Endocrinology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Household ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Food is Medicine: Randomized Trial of Medically-Tailored Food Support for Diabetes Health ABSTRACT In the United States, 29.1 million persons live with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 49 million persons are food-insecure, both disproportionately impacting low-income communities. Food insecurity is strongly associated with the development of T2DM and, among people with T2DM, poor glycemic control, operating through nutritional, mental health, and behavioral pathways. Existing nutrition safety-net resources are inadequate to address the health effects of food insecurity. Policy makers increasingly recognize the premise that “Food is Medicine” - i.e. that medically tailored food support for chronically ill, food-insecure people can play a critical role in achieving optimal health outcomes. In collaboration with Project Open Hand, a large non-profit nutrition agency that provides medically tailored meals and groceries to low-income, chronically ill residents of the San Francisco Bay Area, we propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Changing Health through Food Support for Diabetes (CHEFS-DM). CHEFS-DM is a six-month intervention providing a DM-tailored diet meeting approximately 75% of daily energy requirements and designed based on American Diabetes Association guidelines, together with DM nutritional education provided by registered dieticians. In our pilot study, the intervention was feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in food security, diet quality, health behaviors, mental health, and trends towards improvements in acute care use and DM control. In this pragmatic RCT, we propose to rigorously evaluate the intervention among 400 low-income adults with T2DM recruited from networks of safety net clinics in San Francisco and Alameda counties, California. Leveraging POH's real-world programs, we will randomize participants 1:1 to intervention and control arms, following all participants with surveys, blood pressure measures, anthropometry, 24-hour recalls, medical record review and fasting blood draws at baseline and six months to assess intervention impacts on health outcomes; intervention participants will complete an additional twelve-month assessment to assess sustainability. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of CHEFS-DM on diabetes health, hypothesizing the intervention will improve hemoglobin A1c (primary outcome) and other cardiometabolic outcomes [decreased fasting glucose, blood pressure (BP), lipids, acute care utilization, DM medication intensification and increased health-related quality of life (HRQoL)] (secondary outcomes). In Aim 2, we will use our published conceptual framework to understand the nutritional, mental, and behavioral paths through which CHEFS-DM may impact T2DM health outcomes. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the cost- effectiveness and sustainability of CHEFS-DM, and conduct a mixed-methods process evaluation to understand intervention strengths and limitations to inform scale-up. We hypothesize that the intervention may be cost- effective and possibly even cost saving, and that health benefits will be sustained after the intervention period. Our ultimate goal is to help stop the cycle of food insecurity and diabetes-related morbidity and mortality, consistent with the nutritional, DM-related and health disparities goals of US Healthy People 2020. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medically tailored food for chronically ill, food-insecure people may play a critical role in achieving optimal health outcomes for low-income individuals living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the United States. Our multi- disciplinary team proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial among 400 low-income individuals living with T2DM in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, to test the impact of providing diabetes-tailored food support and nutritional education on T2DM outcomes. This rigorous, community-based study will provide timely evidence on the efficacy of medically tailored food support for T2DM health to inform real-world implementation of “Food is Medicine” programs and policies, in line with NIH priorities for nutrition research.",Food is Medicine: Randomized Trial of Medically-Tailored Food Support for Diabetes Health,9945903,R01DK124630,"['Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' QALY ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Food Supplements ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Nutrition Research ', ' Nutritional Study ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' food security ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' safety net ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' fasting glucose ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Wellbeing trends ', ' Wellness trends ', ' well being trends ', ' Health trends ', ' recruit ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention participants ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' food insecurity ', ' acute care ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Anxiety ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Budgets ', ' California ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Fasting ', ' fasted ', ' fasts ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Household ', ' Lipids ', ' Medical Records ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Community-Based Dietary Approach for Hypertensive African Americans with Chronic Kidney Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) when compared to whites. Racial disparities are most profound among persons of low socioeconomic status (SES) and dietary factors likely underlie much of this disparity. Low SES AAs are more likely to experience food insecurity and live in ""food deserts"" and are less likely to follow a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordant diet than are whites. This is despite evidence that adherence to the DASH diet may have greater blood pressure benefit for AAs than whites, and evidence that the DASH diet may slow CKD progression (including reductions in urine albumin excretion). We propose to build upon encouraging results of our pilot study, ""The Five-Plus Nuts and Beans Trial"", which was conducted as a partnership between Johns Hopkins investigators, a community supermarket, the Baltimore City Health Department's ""Virtual Supermarket"" program, a community-based clinic and a highly engaged Community Advisory Board. This randomized trial tested the effects of a dietary approach to increase consumption of a central feature of the DASH diet--high potassium foods. A total of 123 AA patients with controlled hypertension, and recruited from a community-based clinic, were provided personalized dietary advice, assistance with grocery ordering and delivery, and $30 per week worth of high potassium foods for an 8-week period. With this approach, we demonstrated statistically significant increases in consumption of fruits, vegetables, potassium, magnesium and fiber, and decreases in sodium intake. Also, there was a 14% reduction in urinary albumin excretion overall, and a 30% reduction among patients with significant albuminuria at enrollment. In this application, we propose a larger (n=150) and longer (1 year) trial of a dietary intervention in AAs with hypertension (controlled or uncontrolled) plus mild/moderate CKD-a population at very high risk of the adverse effects of poor diets. The primary aim, in the setting of a randomized trial, is to test the hypothesis that delivery of nutritional advice to adopt the DASH diet and $30 per week worth of potassium-rich foods, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores of patients recruited from community-based clinics, will reduce blood pressure and reduce urinary albumin excretion in low SES AAs with hypertension and CKD. Strengths of our proposal include the integration of an experienced, highly collaborative team of investigators with expertise in clinical trials, nephrology, health disparities, community-based participatory research, integration of trials into primary care practices, and statistical analyses The investigation team includes a highly involved Community Advisory Board, and has an established close partnership with Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, the Baltimore City Health Department and local supermarkets. If our hypothesis is correct, then our trial will establish an immediately translatable, inexpensive, and safe approach for adjuvant therapy in the treatment of hypertension and kidney damage (albuminuria) among low SES AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are disproportionately affected by hypertension and kidney disease in the United States, and these disparities are particularly apparent among socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans. Limited availability of healthy foods and unhealthy diets likely contribute to these disparities. In this community-based randomized clinical trial, we will test whether delivering nutritional advice to adopt the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and $30 per week worth of fruits and vegetables, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores, will reduce blood pressure and kidney damage in socioeconomically disadvantaged African Americans with

"Applying Innovative Approaches to Design and Implement an Intervention to Improve Cardiovascular Health in Hispanic/Latino communities through Restaurants The overall goal of this application is to provide the candidate, Melissa Fuster, Ph.D., essential training to transition into an independent researcher promoting nutrition and cardiovascular health in Hispanic communities through innovative, evidence-based environmental interventions and policies. The proposed project responds to the critical need to improve diet quality and cardiovascular health among Hispanic Caribbean communities using innovative approaches. While most nutrition interventions target individual behaviors, there is a pressing need to create environments that support healthy food choices. Restaurants can be a vehicle to facilitate this change, given the growing importance of foods consumed away from home. Working with an interdisciplinary and multi- sectoral team of mentors and collaborators, Dr. Fuster will apply a theory-based framework from Implementation Sciences to develop and test the Hispanic Caribbean Restaurants in Action (HCRiA) initiative, an intervention to improve nutrition environments in Puerto Rican and Dominican restaurants. Addressing the complex and dynamic nature of restaurant environments, the study complements the theoretical framework with approaches from systems science and human-centered design. These approaches facilitate the engagement of restaurant stakeholders (owners, cooks, and wait-staff) to identify and solve barriers preventing healthier eating behaviors in restaurants. Aim 1 will use a participatory group discussion technique from systems science to characterize customer and restaurant-level factors that facilitate and hinder healthy nutrition environments in HC restaurants. Aim 2 will apply the Behavioral Change Wheel (Implementation Sciences theoretical framework) and human- centered design approaches to engage restaurant stakeholders (owners, staff, and customers) in the design of the HCRiA initiative. Aim 3 will use a mixed-method, quasi-experimental design to pilot test the resulting intervention in a total of four restaurants. Research activities will be intertwined with coursework and mentorship to further development in the following critical training areas: (1) Human-Centered Design and Systems Science, (2) Implementation Science, (3) Quasi-experimental methods, and (4) Large-scale project and grant development. This K01 project contributes public health approaches to improve food environments to ameliorate diet-related health disparities, and the application of implementation science to tackle an important evidence- practice gap, where evidence-based dietary patterns to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease are not being practiced at the community level. The completion of the proposed plan will provide a solid base to successfully compete for R01-level funding for a full-scale community trial of the HCRiA initiative, bolster the applicant’s publication record through dissemination activities among researchers and the community, and augment diversity among nutrition researchers. The persistent nature of diet-related issues, such as cardiovascular disease, necessitate new ways to promote and facilitate healthful eating behaviors, through improvements in community environments including restaurants. This proposal aims to apply theoretical framework from Implementation Science combined with Systems Science and Human-Centered Design approaches to guide the design of an innovative, stakeholder engaged intervention in Hispanic Caribbean restaurants to improve the diet quality and cardiovascular health in the Caribbean Hispanic/Latino community, which presents high risks of diet-related factors contributing to cardiovascular disease. The findings from this study will contribute to improving food environments in diverse communities, as lessons learned from the Hispanic Caribbean experience can be applied to address the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and other diet-related conditions among Hispanics/Latinos (the largest minority group in the United States) and other minority groups in the United States.",Applying Innovative Approaches to Design and Implement an Intervention to Improve Cardiovascular Health in Hispanic/Latino communities through Restaurants,9985624,K01HL147882,"['American Heart Association ', ' Behavior ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Latin America ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' nutrition ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Restaurants ', ' Sales ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium Chloride ', ' salt ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' United States ', ' Vegetables ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Research Activity ', ' Food Policy ', ' Funding ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Environmental Policy ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' cooking ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Calories ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' behavior change ', ' Supermarket ', ' experience ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated fat ', ' Participant ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Melissa ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dominican ', ' Address ', ' Cooking Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Intake ', ' Community Trial ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' food consumption ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' environmental intervention ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' food environment ', ' public health intervention ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' model building ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' Caribbean Hispanic ', ' Latin American ', ' Cuban ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' ']",NHLBI,BROOKLYN COLLEGE,K01,2020,160474,0.13378568736073776
"Impact of Disparities in Food Security on Glycemic Control and Health Care Utilization Among Youth and Young Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Despite recent advances in therapy, far too many youth and young adults (YYAs) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly those of minority race/ethnicity, do not achieve optimal glycemic control thus placing them at increased risk of acute and chronic complications. Among the social determinants of health, household food insecurity (HFI) may be a key barrier to achieving glycemic control and may lead to increased health care utilization and costs, but virtually all of the limited research was cross-sectional and conducted in older adults with T2D. Moreover, racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by HFI, which may underlie similar disparities in diabetes outcomes. Our preliminary work suggests that HFI is a common phenomenon in YYAs with diabetes, affecting 19% of YYAs with T1D and 38% of those with T2D. These rates significantly exceed the 2015 national estimate of 12.7%. We propose a longitudinal study, the SEARCH Food Security (SFS) cohort study, which is designed as an ancillary study to the ongoing CDC/DDT- and NIH/NIDDK-funded SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth 4 study, a racially/ethnically diverse study of diabetes diagnosed in youth. The aims of the SFS study are to: (1) Initiate a food insecurity cohort study of 1,187 YYAs aged 15-35 years (53% minority) with T1D and T2D by adding two data collection time points to the ongoing SEARCH 4 study; (2) Prospectively evaluate the influence of HFI on changes in glycemic control in YYAs with T1D and T2D; (3) Quantify the mediating role of nutritional, mental health, and behavioral pathways through which food insecurity may affect changes in glycemic control in YYAs with T1D and T2D; and (4) Prospectively evaluate the influence of HFI on changes in health care utilization and medical and non-medical health care costs in YYAs with T1D and T2D. Using the SFS data in tandem with extensive data collected by SEARCH will be highly efficient for addressing these aims. The proposed study will be the first cohort study to examine the impact of food insecurity on glycemic control, health care utilization, and costs among a diverse population of US YYAs with T1D and T2D. Our transdisciplinary team is led by Drs. Liese and Mendoza, recognized experts in diabetes, epidemiology, pediatric medicine, disparities, and food insecurity research, and is supported by a team comprising expertise in pediatric endocrinology, psychology, health behaviors, health economics, biostatistics, and causal inference modeling. The study has the potential to alter diabetes policy and clinical practice by establishing the need for more in-depth assessments of food insecurity among YYAs with diabetes, re-assessment of diabetes management and nutrition recommendations for food-insecure patients, and integration of food assistance resources into routine care for persons with diabetes. It will also inform the tailoring of interventions to address food insecurity, especially for minorities, in future diabetes research trials. NARRATIVE Good glycemic control is important for optimal health and prevention of acute and chronic complications among people living with diabetes but food insecurity seems to be a serious barrier to achieving good glycemic control, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. This is the first longitudinal study that will characterize the mechanisms by which food insecurity affects glycemic control and the impact it has on health care utilization and medical and non-medical health care cost in youth and young adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",Impact of Disparities in Food Security on Glycemic Control and Health Care Utilization Among Youth and Young Adults with Diabetes,9910383,R01DK117461,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Buffers ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diabetic Diet ', ' diabetes nutrition ', ' Diabetic Ketoacidosis ', ' Diabetic Acidosis ', ' Diabetic Ketosis ', ' diabetic ketoacidotic ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Endocrinology ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Household ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Morbidity -

"Impact of Navajo Nation Tax on Junk Food 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  2 The Navajo Epidemiology Center manages Navajo public health information systems, and  3 provides data and reports that inform health programming for the over 330,000 enrolled  4 members of the Navajo tribe. Their reports have documented high prevalence of diabetes  5 and obesity, limited availability of healthy traditional foods, and high rates of consumption of  6 sugar sweetened beverages. To address these issues and its consequences, the Navajo  7 Nation passed the Healthy Diné Nation Act (HDNA) in November 2014. The law includes a  8 2% tax on foods of little-to-no-nutritional value (‘junk foods’), the first-ever such tax in the  9 United States. Revenues from the tax are distributed annually to each of the 110 local 10 government entities (chapters) to develop and support local wellness projects. The law was 11 passed with the expectation that the increased cost would impact the food environment, lead 12 to reduced consumption of junk foods and provide a sustainable source of funds to support 13 local needs for wellness programming. 14 To date, however, a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the tax has not been 15 completed. Therefore, the research team, consisting of the Navajo Epidemiology Center, 16 Northern Arizona University and Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital local community 17 affiliate propose to study the impact of the tax on 3 major components: 1) chapter wellness 18 programming supported by tax revenue, 2) changes in the food store environment and 19 pricing following the tax implementation; and 3) changes in sugar sweetened beverage and 20 fruit/vegetable intake following the tax implementation. Chapter wellness programming will be 21 assessed via data from the Division of Community Development, who are supportive of the 22 project. Changes in the food store environment will be assessed via a follow-up of a 2013 23 (pre-tax) survey of 83 stores across the Navajo Nation, which will also identify positive 24 outliers in terms of changes in healthy food offerings. Consumption behaviors will be 25 assessed by conducting a follow-up of the unique Navajo BRFSS, which is a population wide 26 survey following rigorous BRFSS methods. The team has active Navajo IRB protocols to 27 support each aim, and have collaborative support from key stakeholders, positioning us well 28 to deliver on the proposed aims. It is our belief that information from this study is timely, 29 urgent and will be essential for the Navajo Nation leadership to make an informed decision 30 about the continuation of the junk food tax. Project Narrative To address substantial health disparities among the Navajo people, the Navajo Nation passed the 2014 Healthy Diné Nation Act (HDNA), which includes a 2% tax on junk foods. This proposal aims to assess the impact of the junk food tax by utilizing several high quality and culturally specific data sources developed by the Navajo Epidemiology Center. Specifically, we will summarize chapter wellness programming supported by tax revenue, assess changes in the food store environment and behaviors including consumption of sugar- sweetened beverages, fruit and vegetables.",Impact of Navajo Nation Tax on Junk Food,9928749,R01MD013352,"['Arizona ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Government ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Hospitals ', ' Laws ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Methods ', ' Local Government ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Taxation ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' sugar ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Navaho ', ' Navajo ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' authority ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Health Information System ', ' member ', ' Funding Source ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' BRFSS ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Intake ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' cost ', ' consumer demand ', ' tribal Nation ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' food environment ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' Diné ', ' Diné Nation ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,413239,0.26684733529078203
"Increasing SNAP enrollment in a diverse Latinx community Project Summary/Abstract: Health Related Social Needs (HRSN), such as food insecurity, housing quality, and access to transportation, are key drivers of persistent and increasing health disparities. Unmet HSRN are disproportionately prevalent in immigrant communities compared to U.S. born counterparts. Hispanic/Latinx families experience twice the rate of food insecurity than non-Hispanic/Latinx families with higher rates among immigrant Latinx populations. Despite the existence of evidence-based interventions to address food insecurity, health disparity populations have often not benefited from such interventions because either necessary adaptations have not occurred or have not been well-documented or evaluated. This career development award leverages an existing clinic- community collaboration, the Lawrence Mayor's Health Task Force, to develop an implementation strategy to increase enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps) among a multicultural Latinx immigrant community. SNAP enrollment will serve as a prototype evidence-based intervention to identify core community-driven strategies that can be used to adapt and implement additional evidence-based social interventions. This proposal uses robust community-engaged research and implementation science methods to identify and leverage community strengths to increase SNAP enrollment and expand the science of implementing evidence-based interventions in diverse communities. To do so, Dr. Byhoff proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) to conduct a formative evaluation to understand stakeholder perceptions of food access, food programming, and SNAP utilization in a multicultural Latinx immigrant community; 2) to develop an implementation strategy using the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) framework and community engaged research methods to increase SNAP enrollment; and 3) Pilot a SNAP enrollment strategy and identify the essential components for a successful social intervention implementation among a multicultural Latinx immigrant community. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in health disparities research, community- engaged research methods, and implementation science. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Byhoff will emerge from this award as an independent health disparities investigator with expertise in community-engaged research and implementation science methods. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance: Hispanic/Latinx families, especially immigrants, experience twice the rate of food insecurity than non- Hispanic/Latinx families which contributes to disproportionate health disparities. Evidence-based food insecurity interventions, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps), have been demonstrated to improve mental and physical health outcomes for individuals facing food insecurity, yet is an under-utilized program especially among Latinx immigrant communities.

"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Impact of Medicaid ACO funding for health-related social needs on dietary quality and health Despite major advances in therapies, disparities in cancer and cardiometabolic outcomes continue to widen due to differences in socioeconomic status. Food and housing insecurity are social determinants of health that are associated with morbidity from obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and psychological stress, and food insecurity contributes to income disparities in cancer mortality. Although the associations between social needs and health are well-defined, there is a research gap as to whether policies or programs to address food and housing insecurity, particularly through health systems, improve diet, obesity, health, and healthcare utilization. Some states are experimenting with Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in their Medicaid programs with the goal of incentivizing providers and organizations to deliver higher value care, and some ACOs are starting to address social needs. In January 2020, the state of Massachusetts will, for the first time, provide funding directly to Medicaid ACOs to address food and housing needs through the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Flexible Services program. Implementation of this program is a natural experiment that could provide important knowledge about the impact of state-level funding for food and housing needs on diet and health outcomes. The main objectives of this study are to evaluate how the Flexible Services program affects the dietary quality, psychological stress, health, and health care utilization of adult ACO participants and to assess program implementation. The project will take place at five community health centers (CHCs) affiliated with Partners HealthCare, a large health care organization that has contracted with the state as a Medicaid ACO. The project is time-sensitive because the pre-program implementation assessment of diet, stress, food/housing insecurity, and access to resources must be completed before program implementation in 2020. A total of 800 Medicaid ACO patients (Med-ACO) and 200 non-Medicaid CHC patients with food/housing insecurity (Control) will be enrolled and followed for 4 years. Survey, 24-hour dietary recall (ASA24), electronic health record (EHR), and claims data will be collected. Primary outcomes will be change in dietary quality, stress, and food/housing insecurity (Aim 1) and change in body mass index, blood pressure, and acute health care utilization (emergency department visits; hospitalizations) (Aim 2) comparing: a) Med-ACO participants who screen positive for food/housing insecurity pre-implementation vs. Control, and b) Med-ACO participants who screen positive for food/housing and receive Flexible Services (exposed) vs. Med-ACO participants who screen positive but do not receive Flexible Services (not exposed). Aim 3 will assess implementation factors that influence the effectiveness of the program, guided by the RE-AIM/PRISM framework. Results will inform policymakers and researchers about the effectiveness of a novel state-level program for delivering food and housing resources through Medicaid ACOs and will help refine ongoing and future state and community programs that will reduce income disparities in cancer and cardiometabolic disease. The objectives of this proposal are to evaluate the impact of a new state Medicaid program to provide funding for food and housing services on the dietary quality, stress, health, and healthcare utilization of adult patients and to assess the implementation of the program in a large health care organization. The long-term goal of this work is to determine the effectiveness of new programs and policies to address patients’ health-related social needs and to identify facilitators and barriers to implementation of these programs, as well as unintended consequences.",Impact of Medicaid ACO funding for health-related social needs on dietary quality and health,10019534,R01DK124145,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Housing ', ' Incentives ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Patients ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Self Management ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' SNAP ', ' S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine ', ' Services ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' social organization ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Dietary Assessment ', ' health organization ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dietary intake ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' instably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' unstably housed ', ' housing instability ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Impairment ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' primary outcome ', ' social health determinants ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' screening ', ' food environment ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' income disparities ', ' service programs ', ' patient screening ', ' service organization ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' food insecurity ', ' perceived stress ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,612515,0.08069669682206208
"A multi-component intervention in the hunger relief network to improve diet among adults experiencing food insecurity ABSTRACT  The overarching goal of this application is to evaluate the health impact of an intervention targeting the hunger relief network and the clients with food insecurity it serves. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce nutrition-related health disparities by intervening on a system that serves individuals at high risk for chronic disease. In 2014, an estimated 14% of U.S. households experienced food insecurity (i.e., they lacked access to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members). Large numbers of low-income, racial/ethnic minority, and immigrant families who experience food insecurity rely on a hunger relief network that includes food banks and food pantries. Pantry clients have demonstrated poor nutritional outcomes, high chronic disease rates, and dissatisfaction with the quality and cultural-appropriateness of food offered. Unlike other food assistance programs, there are currently no standards on the nutritional quality of pantry offerings, but recent work by our study team demonstrated the need to improve the healthfulness of hunger relief network inventory. We proposed an evaluation of a randomized, sustainable intervention in 8 intervention and 8 control pantries. We will enroll 272 clients at baseline and follow them for 1 year to assess changes in overall diet quality (the primary outcome). Working with our food bank partners, the intervention at the pantry level targets the supply of nutritious foods, through policy and practice changes and capacity-building. At the client level, the intervention targets healthy food demand, using behavioral economic and educational approaches. Measured outcomes include overall diet quality (the primary outcome), as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI), the nutritional quality of foods selected at the food shelf visit, and cardiovascular disease health (assessed by the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 scores). The study will also evaluate the impact of a multilevel intervention on the nutritional quality of pantry offerings, measured by a Hunger Relief Nutrition Index. The study also aims to improve implementation of policies and practices that promote a nutrition-focused hunger relief network, as assessed by survey and key informant interviews. As an exploratory aim, the study will evaluate the cultural appropriateness of pantry foods and services, given the burden of poor food access on minority, immigrant, and refugee families. After a 1-year needs assessment, an intervention will be conducted in 2 waves in Years 2-3. Years 4-5 will be focused on analysis and local and regional dissemination through channels supported by our partnering agencies. This work capitalizes on a palpable local momentum towards improving the hunger relief system. Research aims address the need for a system- wide approach to improving the hunger relief network and evaluation of its impact on client outcomes. NARRATIVE The hunger safety net fills a critical need among low-income adults with diet-related chronic disease. The challenges faced within the hunger relief network require a multimodal approach for improvement. This study will evaluate the impact of a multicomponent intervention, targeting the supply of healthy food in food pantries and encouraging the selection of healthier items, on client diet and cardiovascular disease risk.",A multi-component intervention in the hunger relief network to improve diet among adults experiencing food insecurity,9895471,R01HL136640,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Behavior ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Client ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' whole grain ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Selections ', ' Food Services ', ' Food Supply ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Hunger ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutrition Indexes ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' improved ', ' diet education ', ' nutrition education ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Immigrant ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' cooking ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' palpable disease ', ' Palpable ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' food quality ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Food Assistance Programs ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' informant ', ' Minority ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' primary outcome ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' behavioral economics ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' food insecurity ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,261637,0.32212693865208136
"Pilot Study of the Nutrition-Enhanced Wellness for Diabetes Self-Management Program (NEW-DSMP) among Low-Income Adults with Type II Diabetes ABSTRACT Improving diabetes health is a public-health imperative. Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is highly prevalent and a leading cause of disability and cardiovascular disease in the US. T2DM disproportionately impacts low-income individuals in the US, who are also at significant risk for food insecurity, defined as having limited access to nutritious food for a healthy life. Food insecurity is associated with poor diabetes control, morbidity, and mortality. Diabetes self-management education, such as that provided via the evidence-based Diabetes Self-Management Program (DSMP), is an important aspect of diabetes care but does not address structural barriers to diabetes health, such as lack of access to healthy foods to follow a diabetes diet. Medically-tailored, diabetes-healthy food support may improve nutrition, self-management, mental health and diabetes health for low-income individuals with T2DM based on preliminary studies. Yet the efficacy of this approach on diabetes health may vary depending on the design of food support, how it is integrated with diabetes education, and how it is situated vis- à-vis healthcare. Generating rigorous evidence to inform the design and implementation of medically-tailored food interventions for diabetes is crucial, given the current policy interest in addressing the twin issues of food insecurity and chronic illness via “food as medicine” approaches. Together with The Health Trust, a non-profit organization with extensive experience providing the DSMP and nutrition services to low-income, chronically-ill individuals in Northern California, we propose the Nutrition-Enhanced Wellness DSMP (NEW-DSMP) Pilot Study. Our goal for this pragmatic, pilot cluster-randomized trial is to test the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact of providing 12 weeks of diabetes-healthy food support (i.e. medically-tailored meals and groceries), plus individualized sessions with a registered dietitian, to low-income individuals with T2DM participating in the DSMP, compared to DSMP participation alone. Participants will be eligible if they have T2DM, are over 21, are low-income, and speak English or Spanish. In Aim 1, we will conduct three focus groups to investigate preferences, challenges, and opportunities for intervention design and implementation. In Aim 2, we will pilot the NEW-DSMP intervention for feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact using a cluster- randomized design. We will randomize 6 DSMP groups (~12 people per group) 1:1 to intervention and control arms (total individual n=72), following them over four assessments at 0, 6, 12 and 24 weeks with surveys, anthropometry, and blood samples. Our primary outcome is glycemic control, measured via hemoglobin A1c; secondary outcomes include fasting glucose and health-related quality-of-life. We will also test the impact on intermediate nutritional, mental health, and behavioral outcomes. In Aim 3, we will conduct process evaluation to understand intervention and trial strengths and weaknesses. Data from this pilot study will inform the planning of a full-size cluster-randomized trial to test the efficacy of the NEW-DSMP model, with a long-term goal to inform policy debates about the value of implementing medically-tailored food interventions as part of healthcare. Public Health Significance A multicomponent intervention combining formal diabetes self-management support with medically-tailored food and registered-dietitian support is a novel and potentially effective strategy to improve diabetes health and quality-of-life, and reduce diabetes disparities, among low-income people with type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our team will conduct a pilot cluster-randomized trial in a real-world setting among low-income individuals with T2DM enrolled in a Diabetes Self-Management Program (DSMP) to understand whether enhancing the DSMP with diabetes-healthy, medically-tailored food provision and registered-dietitian support is feasible, acceptable and preliminarily improves diabetes health. Study results will inform the planning of a subsequent efficacy trial, with the goal to inform the integration of diabetes care programs with food security systems, to improve diabetes health outcomes and reduce socioeconomic disparities.",Pilot Study of the Nutrition-Enhanced Wellness for Diabetes Self-Management Program (NEW-DSMP) among Low-Income Adults with Type II Diabetes,9875253,R21DK123632,"['designing ', ' design ', ' food security ', ' glycemic control ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Consumption ', ' safety net ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' diabetes control ', ' efficacy testing ', ' fasting glucose ', ' arm ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' trial design ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' self-management program ', ' intervention participants ', ' food insecurity ', ' diabetes distress ', ' diabetes self-care ', ' diabetes self-management ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Counseling ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Exercise ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Household ', ' Interview ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Morbidity -

"CommunityRx for Hunger - Resubmission 01 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Food insecurity is a prevalent, modifiable and overlooked determinant of health and health disparities along socioeconomic and racial lines in the United States. Lower income caregivers (parents, custodial grandparents, legal guardians) of children with illness requiring hospitalization are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity due to healthcare costs and prioritizing food for the child. The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Academy of Medicine and others are calling for healthcare-based screening and intervention to address food insecurity, endorsing growing evidence about the deleterious effects on health and healthcare. Most caregivers and healthcare providers endorse that it is acceptable for providers to address food insecurity and related needs, yet physicians rarely screen or make referrals for these needs. Barriers include concerns about compromising caregiver or patient satisfaction by causing feelings of stigma and providers' lack of knowledge about food insecurity. The proposed mixed-methods research will fill a gap in knowledge about how best to intervene to support food insecure caregivers. We will conduct a double-blind randomized controlled trial to test the effect of the CommunityRx-Hunger (CRx-H) intervention on caregiver and child health outcomes over 12 months. CRx-H leverages hospital discharge processes used to prepare caregivers to care for an ill child, including education and activation of self- and family management strategies. Caregivers of hospitalized children will be screened for food insecurity, stratified by food security status, and randomized to either usual care (UC) or CRx-H. UC includes a hospital admission packet with information about food resources in the hospital. In addition to UC, CRx-H includes, at discharge: a brief educational intervention about food insecurity and common co-occurring needs, information about quality community resources for food and other support, and text messages from a community resource navigator over 90 days post-discharge. The specific aims of this research are to: (1) Evaluate the effects of CRx-H versus UC on food insecure caregiver self-efficacy, caregiver and child food insecurity, and adult and child health outcomes; (2) Among food secure and insecure caregivers, evaluate the effects of CRx-H versus UC on caregiver satisfaction with care and stigma; (3) Qualitatively assess food insecure caregivers' perspectives about: (a) their experiences with and attitudes toward the CRx-H intervention, (b) the role of stigma as a barrier to self- and family management, and (c) how healthcare providers can sensitively and effectively intervene to support food insecure caregivers.. Our objective is to improve self- and family management among food insecure caregivers with an ill child. The long-term goal of this work advances the mission of the NIMHD by generating evidence on public health practices to promote the health of caregivers and their families and to reduce health disparities due to socioeconomic disadvantage. PROJECT NARRATIVE Food insecurity is a prevalent and modifiable, but largely overlooked, determinant of health and health disparities.

"Health consequences of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program administrative decisions across the monthly SNAP benefit cycle PROJECT SUMMARY  Food security and a healthful diet are important factors in cancer prevention and economic stability. Food insecurity is associated with lower dietary quality, obesity, and poor health outcomes including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer in both adults in children. Likewise, poor diet is associated with obesity and chronic disease. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal program designed with an aim to alleviate food insecurity and improve the diet of those most at risk for an inability to afford sufficient, healthy food. The proposed research aims to understand how the dollar amount of SNAP benefits change recipients’ ability to afford and consume a sufficient and healthful diet across the SNAP benefit month, and to understand which families are most vulnerable and most affected by benefit levels. There are three specific aims of this research: (1) to evaluate the impact of an additional SNAP benefit dollar on ability to purchase sufficient, healthy food across the monthly SNAP benefit cycle, including examining the effect on caloric intake and diet components; (2) to identify the subgroups most impacted by SNAP benefit dollar amount and the monthly SNAP benefit cycle, including by race/ethnicity, female-headed households, and diagnosis of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity; and (3) to compare the effects of an additional SNAP benefit dollar on the monthly SNAP benefit cycle found using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-12 collection wave and the Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey. Methods for primary studies include fixed effects and differences-in-differences frameworks. This research is, to my knowledge, the first to examine the effects of the SNAP benefit amount in the context of both an increase and a decrease in dollar amount due to the same legislation, as well as the first to assess the effects of benefit amount across the month. These questions are key for policy makers and non-profits when targeting cancer prevention efforts. Findings have the potential to inform decisions to better support low-income families in maintaining a sufficient, healthy diet for prevention of chronic disease and reducing cancer risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE Food security and a healthful diet are important factors in cancer prevention and economic stability.

"FORWARD-COVID 19 Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: Food allergy (FA) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects an estimated 8% of children in the United States. Although differences between Black and White children in the prevalence and severity of other atopic conditions such as asthma and eczema have been well described, little is known about such differences in FA. The limited existing literature indicates that Black children may have worse clinical outcomes, including rates of FA-related fatal anaphylaxis and FA-related emergency department (ED) visits, than their White peers. Phenotypic and endotypic differences, including rates of sensitization and co- morbidities, between Black and White children are beginning to be examined. Data on racial differences in FA management practices are incomplete; preliminary data suggest that Black families spend significantly less on allergen-free foods and FA medications than do White families. Families caring for children with FA experience significant impairments in psychosocial outcomes, including FA-related quality of life (FAQoL); however, these data come primarily from White, privately insured families, and little is known about psychosocial outcomes in Black families. Two recent reviews concluded that existing studies examining racial disparities in FA are far too methodologically limited to draw definitive conclusions, primarily due to reliance on self-report of FA diagnosis and cross-sectional designs. Specific Aims and Methods: Our goal is to prospectively study a cohort of 800 Black and White children (0- 12 years) with FA in order to: 1) Determine variability in clinical FA outcomes between Black and White patients via quarterly online assessments, annual clinic visits, and medical chart review over a two-year period; 2) Examine phenotypic and endotypic differences between Black and White children with FA using specific laboratory specimen collection techniques and assays; 3) Identify differences between Black and White children in FA management practices by parent report (e.g. allergen avoidance and epinephrine carriage); and 4) Determine differences between Black and White children in psychosocial FA-related outcomes (e.g., FA-related quality of life, bullying, anxiety, and worry) via the above survey methods. Hypotheses and Expected Results: We hypothesize that compared to White children, Black children will: have higher rates of food-allergic reactions and FA-related healthcare utilization; demonstrate unique FA phenotypes and endotypes; have less knowledge of FA management and less adherence to preventative behaviors; have limited access to medications and allergen-free foods; and report better quality of life. Significance and Effects on Other Research: Confirming and further characterizing differences between Black and White children with FA will provide the data required to develop clinical guidelines, optimize treatment, and build health policies that meet the needs of both Black and White children.

"Dietary Quality, Cognitive Decline and Brain Health in Puerto Rican Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this proposal is that consumption of highly processed foods contributes to cognitive decline with aging. These dietary effects may lead to health disparities in cognitive decline due to the known greater consumption of highly processed foods in low-income populations. While many factors are associated with the effects of a diet characterized by highly processed foods, including displacement of healthy foods and the myriad of nutrients associated with these, we propose that two nutrients, in particular, may have effects through known or emerging pathways that affect brain function. First, there is evidence that highly processed foods contribute to greater intake of phosphorus (P) through P-based food additives which can increase food P content by ≥70%. Vascular risk factors predict cognitive decline and excess P may elevate CVD risk. However, the role of P in cognitive decline remains unclear. One novel pathway is compensatory elevation in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a predictor of vascular calcification and CVD. Klotho, a putative anti-aging factor, may be protective against CVD and cognitive decline. Among mice, a high P diet reduced klotho secretion. Excessive P consumption may lower klotho and impair cognitive function through modulation of FGF23, but human data remain sparse. P also elevates parathyroid hormone (PTH), which predicts CVD mortality and presence of cerebral infarcts. Second, vitamin B6 (B6), a critical cofactor for ≥100 metabolic reactions, is easily lost with food processing and unlike other B vitamins is not added back to enriched grains. We have shown that low B6 status was associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and depressive symptoms in Puerto Rican adults. Earlier work with non-Hispanic white men, showed associations of both diet and plasma B6 (pyridoxl-5'-phosphate,PLP) with 3 y cognitive decline. Latinos appear to be disproportionately burdened by cognitive impairment compared to non-Hispanic whites. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that Puerto Ricans have >twice the odds of low global cognitive function compared to Mexicans. With the growing and aging Latino population in the U.S likely to contribute to major increases in the burden of cognitive decline, it is critical that we improve our understanding of preventive risk factors that may inform interventions. We will use data from the Boston Puerto Rican Health study (BPRHS), a longitudinal cohort study of U.S. mainland Puerto Ricans (45-74 y) with diet, nutritional biomarkers, and cognitive function testing data available at baseline and 2 and 5 y follow-up. We will recruit BPRHS participants to return (~ 8-y from baseline) for a repeat battery of cognitive exams and, for a subset, an MRI scan. We will quantify the associations between processed foods consumption, P status (serum P, FGF23, klotho, and PTH), dietary B6, and PLP, as exposures, with ~8 y cognitive decline (psychometric testing) and brain structure, cerebral infarcts, white matter integrity, and connectivity (MRI) at ~8 y, as outcomes. Further the potential mediative roles of inflammation (CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) will be measured. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive decline is an increasing health concern among U.S. Latino adults, particularly those of Puerto Rican heritage. The current COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting all aspects of life, and there is evidence of more negative effects on minority populations, including Latinos, with disproportional rates of infection and death, as well as economic loss. The proposed supplement aims to evaluate the social, economic and health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to cognitive decline and brain health among older U.S. mainland Puerto Rican adults. These data will provide critical information to improve our understanding of preventive risk factors that may inform interventions.","Dietary Quality, Cognitive Decline and Brain Health in Puerto

"Food is Medicine: A Randomized Clinical Trial of Medically Tailored Meals For Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Food Insecurity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Food insecurity, “lack of access to enough food for an active, healthy life”, affects over 20% of the 30 million Americans with diabetes. Food insecurity is more common in racial/ethnic minorities and those with lower socioeconomic status. Moreover, food insecurity is associated with worse diabetes control and increased complications, even after adjusting for other risk factors. Food insecurity is a major contributor to disparities in diabetes outcomes.  Medically tailored meal (MTM) delivery programs are a promising intervention for individuals with diabetes and food insecurity. MTM programs deliver fully prepared food, tailored by a registered dietitian nutritionist to the specific medical needs of the individual, and provide education to help optimize disease self-management. Food insecurity is typically addressed with food subsidies—offering additional financial resources that can be spent on food. While both food subsidies and MTM can increase healthy food access, MTM can help overcome other barriers to diabetes management including lack of time, ability, knowledge, and skills needed to prepare appropriate meals. The use of these programs is often called ‘food is medicine’, as the purpose is to provide exactly the foods needed to help prevent diabetes complications. MTM are receiving increasing public attention, but there are, as of yet, no full-scale trials to test its effects on diabetes outcomes when compared with other food insecurity interventions.  Our research team has developed a medically tailored meal intervention that combines provision of healthy food, tailored to the specific nutrition needs of the individual, with an evidence-based lifestyle intervention that uses the period of meal delivery as springboard to improve diabetes self-management, both while receiving meals and after meal delivery is completed. MTM was highly successful in improving diet quality in a pilot randomized clinical trial. What is missing is an explanatory (efficacy) randomized trial testing whether this medically tailored meal intervention can lead to improvements in diabetes outcomes such as Hemoglobin A1c, and in patient-reported outcomes such as diabetes distress, quality of life, and hypoglycemia.  Thus, we propose a randomized trial to assess a community-based medically tailored meals intervention (n=200). It will be conducted among diverse participants referred for medically tailored meals. Adults with type 2 diabetes, Hemoglobin A1c between 7.0% and 12.0%, and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (≥ 23 kg/m2 for those with Asian ancestry) will be enrolled and randomly assigned to intervention or usual care + food subsidy. The intervention group will receive meal delivery and its attendant lifestyle intervention for 6 months, while the usual care + food subsidy group will receive a $30/month healthy food subsidy, along with usual diabetes care. Outcomes will be assessed at 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is Hemoglobin A1c at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include change in physiologic, behavioral, and psychosocial measures. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over 30 million Americans have diabetes, and 1 in 6, over 5 million, report food insecurity, or insufficient access to enough food for an active, healthy life. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of how to best address food insecurity in the context of diabetes management by testing an innovative medically-tailored meal delivery intervention for individuals with food insecurity and elevated blood sugar levels. This intervention has the potential to improve health and reduce the impact of food insecurity among vulnerable individuals with diabetes.",Food is Medicine: A Randomized Clinical Trial of Medically

"Sex-based differences in the neuronal mechanisms of food intake behavior Project Summary/Abstract Obesity rates are rapidly rising, as are related health and quality-of-life complications. As such, gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of obesity is critical. Because diet and eating behaviors are core contributors to weight gain, an improved understanding of these processes is required. A key variable in these processes that is currently poorly understood is the effect of sex. Sex- based differences in eating behaviors are consistently observed in both animal and human studies. To date, however, these differences, and their impact on our understanding of the mechanisms of eating behavior, have not been well studied. Failure to study sex effects in this context substantially limits our understanding of these important mechanisms, can result in unnecessary replication of research, and may contribute to problems of reproducibility in clinical research. As such, investigating sex-specific biological processes will lead to a better understanding of underlying mechanisms and will be a critical step in understanding how these mechanisms translate to behavior.  Sex differences in eating behaviors involve a number of factors, such as gonadal hormones, social pressures, and physical activity engagement. These factors also interact with neuronal processes involved in eating behaviors. A clear understanding of sex differences in neuronal mechanisms underlying food intake behaviors has yet to be established. While previous studies have examined sex differences in neuronal response to food cues, results have been inconsistent. Disparities may be due to insufficient sample sizes, lack of menstrual cycle phase consistency, and lack of controlled food intake behavior. Hedonic eating, or eating beyond homeostatic needs, may be particularly associated with obesity. As such, identifying sex differences in neurobiology underlying hedonic eating is of particular relevance. To this end, we recently completed a preliminary investigation of sex differences in neuronal responses to food cues with high (vs. neutral) hedonic value, in both fasted and fed states. Sex differences were observed in the fasted state, with greater responses in women than men in the nucleus accumbens and insula, brain regions with prominent roles in food-related reward processing. This may indicate that women are more sensitive to rewarding aspects of foods when fasted.  The overall goal of this application is to expand on our initial findings to better understand sex-based differences in the neurobiology underlying hedonic eating behaviors and food-based reward processing, how gonadal hormones contribute to these differences, and how this translates to real-life eating behaviors. Project Narrative The overall goal of this application is to expand on our initial findings to better understand sex-based differences in the neurobiology underlying hedonic eating behaviors and food-based reward processing, how gonadal hormones contribute to these differences, and how this translates to real-life eating behaviors.",Sex-based differences in the neuronal mechanisms of food intake behavior,10018876,R01DK119236,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Animals ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Behavior ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cues ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Estradiol ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Diogyn ', ' Diogynets ', ' Estrace ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estraldine ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Progynon ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Fasting ', ' fasted ', ' fasts ', ' proliferative phase Menstrual cycle ', ' Follicular Phase ', ' Follicular Phase Menstrual Cycle ', ' Menstrual Proliferative Phase ', ' Preovulatory Phase ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hunger ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Luteal Phase ', ' Luteal Phase Menstrual Cycle ', ' Menstrual Secretory Phase ', ' Postovulatory Phase ', ' Secretory Phase Menstrual Cycle ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' pressure ', ' Progesterone ', ' Corpus Luteum Hormone ', ' Delta4-pregnene-3,20-dione ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione ', ' Pregnenedione ', ' Therapeutic Progesterone ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Satiation ', ' satiety ', ' Translating ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physical activity ', ' Failure ', ' Sample Size ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Gonadal Hormones ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Scanning ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' food consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' hedonic ', ' reward processing ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' biological systems ', ' obesity development ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,524928,0.11194160704165176
"A multi-component intervention in the hunger relief network to improve diet among adults experiencing food insecurity ABSTRACT  The overarching goal of this application is to evaluate the health impact of an intervention targeting the hunger relief network and the clients with food insecurity it serves. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce nutrition-related health disparities by intervening on a system that serves individuals at high risk for chronic disease. In 2014, an estimated 14% of U.S. households experienced food insecurity (i.e., they lacked access to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members). Large numbers of low-income, racial/ethnic minority, and immigrant families who experience food insecurity rely on a hunger relief network that includes food banks and food pantries. Pantry clients have demonstrated poor nutritional outcomes, high chronic disease rates, and dissatisfaction with the quality and cultural-appropriateness of food offered. Unlike other food assistance programs, there are currently no standards on the nutritional quality of pantry offerings, but recent work by our study team demonstrated the need to improve the healthfulness of hunger relief network inventory. We proposed an evaluation of a randomized, sustainable intervention in 8 intervention and 8 control pantries. We will enroll 272 clients at baseline and follow them for 1 year to assess changes in overall diet quality (the primary outcome). Working with our food bank partners, the intervention at the pantry level targets the supply of nutritious foods, through policy and practice changes and capacity-building. At the client level, the intervention targets healthy food demand, using behavioral economic and educational approaches. Measured outcomes include overall diet quality (the primary outcome), as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI), the nutritional quality of foods selected at the food shelf visit, and cardiovascular disease health (assessed by the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 scores). The study will also evaluate the impact of a multilevel intervention on the nutritional quality of pantry offerings, measured by a Hunger Relief Nutrition Index. The study also aims to improve implementation of policies and practices that promote a nutrition-focused hunger relief network, as assessed by survey and key informant interviews. As an exploratory aim, the study will evaluate the cultural appropriateness of pantry foods and services, given the burden of poor food access on minority, immigrant, and refugee families. After a 1-year needs assessment, an intervention will be conducted in 2 waves in Years 2-3. Years 4-5 will be focused on analysis and local and regional dissemination through channels supported by our partnering agencies. This work capitalizes on a palpable local momentum towards improving the hunger relief system. Research aims address the need for a system- wide approach to improving the hunger relief network and evaluation of its impact on client outcomes. NARRATIVE The hunger safety net fills a critical need among low-income adults with diet-related chronic disease. The challenges faced within the hunger relief network require a multimodal approach for improvement. This study will evaluate the impact of a multicomponent intervention, targeting the supply of healthy food in food pantries and encouraging the selection of healthier items, on client diet and cardiovascular disease risk.",A multi-component intervention in the hunger relief network to improve diet among adults experiencing food insecurity,10291727,R01HL136640,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Behavior ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Client ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' whole grain ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Selections ', ' Food Services ', ' Food Supply ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Hunger ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutrition Indexes ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' improved ', ' diet education ', ' nutrition education ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Immigrant ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' cooking ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' palpable disease ', ' Palpable ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' food quality ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Food Assistance Programs ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' informant ', ' Minority ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' primary outcome ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' behavioral economics ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' food insecurity ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,312966,0.32212693865208136
"Population-level interventions and community environment effects on child obesity disparities Background and significance: Obesity rates remain high, despite nationwide declines and plateaus in the overall prevalence of obesity among some groups. Crucially, Black and Latino children have higher obesity rates than non-Hispanic Whites (hereafter “disparities”). Effective strategies to reduce child obesity and disparities could significantly contribute to population health improvements and reductions in racial/ethnic health disparities. Nutrition policies—those that regulate the nutritional content of foods and beverages in schools, including the so-called “competitive” foods because they are sold separately from school meals— could play a key role in the primary prevention of obesity and related chronic diseases. The effect of nutrition policies however, can be strengthened or weakened by the community food environment near schools (e.g., through children’s access, purchases and consumption of unhealthy foods). No studies have yet examined the combined influences of multiple nutrition policies and community food environments on child obesity and disparities. Objectives: This quasi-experimental study is responsive to the NIH Obesity Strategic Plan and proposes to: (1) determine the obesity effects of the California nutrition policy improving and limiting access to “competitive” foods/beverages together with the recent federal policy to improve school meal nutrition standards; and (2) investigate whether community food environments modify the effect nutrition policies on obesity and related disparities. Innovation. The study: (a) improves causal inferences about the effects of nutrition policies on obesity and disparities using rigorous, complementary methods (interrupted time series design, propensity scores, and latent class analysis, GIS); (b) simultaneously investigates the obesity effects of the nutrition policies and the surrounding school food environment; and (c) uses a longitudinal, robust (>16 million) population-based data containing objective individual-level BMI measures of diverse children (51% Latino, 6% Black, 33% White, 8% Asian) linked with the community food environments of all the public schools to which children attended in California from 2001 to 2017.  Public health relevance, influence on other research and expected results: Preventing obesity and eliminating health disparities are major public health goals in Healthy People 2020. This study has the potential to influence the fields of obesity prevention science, racial/ethnic health disparities, as well as nutrition policy and environmental strategies to improve overall child health. The results generated from this study will: (a) strengthen the evidence base by elucidating the causal effects of promising, large scale nutrition interventions on obesity and related disparities; (b) identify characteristics of nutrition environments near schools where such nutrition policies are most effective; and (c) illuminate environments (inside and/or near schools) where additional interventions are needed.

"Appalachians Together Restoring the Eating Environment (Appal-TREE): Advancing Sustainable CBPR Interventions to Improve Healthy Diet in Rural Appalachian Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The National Institutes of Health has acknowledged that residents of rural Appalachia experience among the nation's worst health and economic profiles, including disability and premature mortality stemming from elevated rates of heart disease and stroke, various cancers, diabetes, all of which are closely associated with suboptimal dietary intake, obesity, and overweight. Community members are particularly concerned about their children, who have among the highest rates of obesity, overweight, and suboptimal dietary intake in the nation. Eliminating these health disparities requires scientificaly informed community-engaged research to develop and evaluate innovative and sustainable programs and policies. For the proposed application, our community-research team will (1) use an innovative information technology CBPR method - Structured Public Involvement - to refine and tailor a package of pilot tested healthy eating interventions; (2) conduct and evaluate this package of interventions that were found to be feasible, culturally consonant, and promising during R24MD008018 and (3) build community capacity in social marketing, an innovative approach to enhance sustainability of the intervention. Our partners include the Community Farm Alliance, local school districts, the Cooperative Extension Service, and other community organizations. For the first aim, the innovative CBPR approach Structured Public Involvement will allow us to tailor the intervention while maintaining project fidelity. For the second aim, we will administer and evaluate three interrelated interventions to transform access to and intake of healthy foods for Appalachian children; (1) a school-based water campaign to decrease sugar sweetened beverage consumption (2) healthy cooking classes to encourage healthy cooking on a budget; and (3).a farmer's market-based healthy summer feeding program. Finally, in Aim 3, we will administer a CBPR-oriented approach, social marketing, to enhance sustainability, a challenge for all behavioral interventions. Through the schools, we will train teachers and administrators to teach social marketing to students, who will be encouraged to develop marketing campaigns supporting healthy diets. All of these efforts will be developed, implemented, and evaluated in conjunction with our Community Advisory Boards. As one of our local stakeholders told us, ""If you really are what you eat, it's no wonder so many of us are unhealthy."" By developing sustainable, evidence-based programming, we aim to transform consumption patterns and the eating environment so the next generation of rural residents can overcome pernicious health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Appalachians Together Restoring the Eating Environment (Appal-TREE) uses a new CBPR technology to solicit community input, delivers a tested package of healthy diet interventions (water promotion, cooking classes, and expansion of the Summer Food Service Program via farmers markets) to Appalachian communities.

"Social networks, acculturation, and food behaviors and values among Mexican-American families PROJECT SUMMARY The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is two to three times higher among Mexican Americans than non-Latino whites, and Mexican Americans are more likely to develop diabetes at younger ages and suffer higher rates of complications. Many of these complications could be reduced substantially by targeting health behaviors such as diet and exercise; however, research has shown that, for Mexican Americans, healthful diet-related behaviors, as well as obesity prevalence, decrease with greater acculturation, including years in the U.S. or English-language adoption. Social networks play an important role in obesity and diet through social support, access to resources, social engagement, and social norms. However, an important and unanswered question is the extent to which less-healthy food behaviors and values are diffused across social networks among Mexican Americans and whether the diffusion of food behaviors and values differs by acculturation status. The goal of this proposal, in response to PAR-16-064 `Small Grants for New Investigators to Promote Diversity in Health-Research (R21),' is to examine the influence of the personal social networks of Mexican American families on food behaviors and values as well as objectively measured health outcomes (i.e., hbA1c and BMI). This project will build on our ongoing collaborations large Catholic churches in Los Angeles and New York by examining two specific aims: (1) To quantitatively characterize the personal networks of English-dominant and Spanish-dominant Mexican American families and test the network characteristics that are associated with unhealthful eating patterns, diabetes, and obesity and (2) To qualitatively explore how social networks influence English-dominant and Spanish-dominant Mexican American families' food behaviors and values. We will explore group differences in social networks between 81 Spanish-dominant and 81 English-dominant Mexican-American adults attending Sunday services at large Catholic churches. We will then select 25 information-rich cases for in-depth interviews and ethnographic observations, which will allow us to gain insights into food behaviors and values that may be socially transmitted. This study will provide preliminary data to develop an R34 application targeting specific social network features that influence diabetes-related behaviors among this vulnerable population. This study represents an important step in Dr. Karen Flórez's progress towards becoming an independent New Investigator and will advance the NIDDK's mission to increase diversity in health-related research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to examine the influence of the personal social networks of Mexican American families on food behaviors and values as well as objectively measured health outcomes (i.e., hbA1c and BMI). The study will quantitatively characterize the personal networks of English-dominant and Spanish-dominant Mexican American families, test the network characteristics that are associated with unhealthful eating patterns, diabetes, and obesity; and qualitatively explore how social networks influence food behaviors and values.","Social networks, acculturation, and food behaviors and values among Mexican-American families",9937704,R21DK114630,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Diffusion ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Mission ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Latino ', ' Social Network ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Diffuse ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Mexican ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' cooking ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' English Language ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Services ', ' Church ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' diabetes risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' diet and exercise ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' obesity risk ', ' family support ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' social engagement ', ' Infrastructure ', ' social factors ', ' Visualization ', ' ']",NIDDK,GRADUATE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH POLICY,R21,2020,209239,0.10339478150274589
"Testing combinations of population interventions to encourage healthy eating ABSTRACT Population-level interventions to encourage healthy eating—which involve changing food environments or purchasing conditions—have been extensively discussed for the prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Preliminary data suggest that population interventions introduced in isolation (such as an SSB tax) can have a modest effect, but multi-faceted interventions should be introduced in combination, to produce large and meaningful improvements in healthy eating. Studying combinations of population interventions is difficult, as such interventions are rare. We propose to rigorously assess a rare set of nested natural experiments in the two largest, most diverse urban settings in California (CA): Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. We will identify the complementarities among major population-level interventions to encourage healthy eating. In Aim 1, we will conduct a prospective evaluation of a population-wide SSB tax in both tax-affected and matched unaffected CA counties. We will identify changes to both beverage and food consumption and purchasing, food substitution patterns, spillover to neighboring areas, effects of marketing, and any regressive economic effects for low-income populations. The longer-term follow-up period enabled by our design will test the hypothesis that a SSB tax produces sustained declines in SSB consumption rather than merely short-term effects followed by a return to pre-tax consumption. Uniquely, we will then test complementarity between the tax and other interventions in Aims 2 and 3. In Aim 2, we will examine the complementarity of the SSB tax with a fruit and vegetable voucher program. Some SSB tax-affected and distant tax-unaffected counties have introduced fresh fruit and vegetable purchasing vouchers, which enable low-income families facing food insecurity to purchase fruits and vegetables at major supermarkets and corner stores in the area, not just at farmer’s markets. We will test the hypothesis, supported by our preliminary data, that pairing the purchasing penalty of an SSB tax with a purchasing incentive of a fruit and vegetable voucher improves upon the modest effect of either intervention alone. In Aim 3, we will identify the complementarity between the SSB tax and a workplace SSB purchasing ban, implemented in some workplaces but not others during tax-affected and -unaffected periods. We will test the hypothesis, consistent with our preliminary data, that workplace bans disproportionately reduce SSB consumption in the lowest-income employees, neutralizing the economically-regressive effect of a SSB tax. We will evaluate these interventions using innovative methods that advance the study of natural experiments in obesity and diabetes prevention. Specifically, we will use a synthetic control statistical method, which adjusts for unmeasured confounders such as differences in culture among the intervention and control areas. Second, we will input our results into validated computer simulation models of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, allowing us to project the generalizable impact and cost-effectiveness of the interventions for reducing long-term national race/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Population-level interventions to encourage healthy eating—which often involve changing food environments or purchasing conditions—have been extensively discussed for the prevention of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Current theory suggests that to significantly reduce such diseases at a population level, multi-faceted interventions should be introduced in combination, but such combinations are challenging to study given their rarity. We propose to rigorously assess multiple natural experiments in well-matched populations, fulfilling a strategic NIH goal to understand what interventions in combination can lead to population-wide reductions in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.",Testing combinations of population interventions to encourage healthy eating,9930076,R01DK116852,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Beverages ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Demography ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incentives ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Sales ', ' San Francisco ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' Workplace ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' Calories ', ' Frequencies ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Supermarket ', ' Employee ', ' novel ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' theories ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Intake ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' food consumption ', ' obesity prevention ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' food environment ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' lower income families ', ' farmers markets ', ' urban setting ', ' food insecurity ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,777821,0.12057095732386269
"Dietary Quality, Cognitive Decline and Brain Health in Puerto Rican Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this proposal is that consumption of highly processed foods contributes to cognitive decline with aging. These dietary effects may lead to health disparities in cognitive decline due to the known greater consumption of highly processed foods in low-income populations. While many factors are associated with the effects of a diet characterized by highly processed foods, including displacement of healthy foods and the myriad of nutrients associated with these, we propose that two nutrients, in particular, may have effects through known or emerging pathways that affect brain function. First, there is evidence that highly processed foods contribute to greater intake of phosphorus (P) through P-based food additives which can increase food P content by ≥70%. Vascular risk factors predict cognitive decline and excess P may elevate CVD risk. However, the role of P in cognitive decline remains unclear. One novel pathway is compensatory elevation in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a predictor of vascular calcification and CVD. Klotho, a putative anti-aging factor, may be protective against CVD and cognitive decline. Among mice, a high P diet reduced klotho secretion. Excessive P consumption may lower klotho and impair cognitive function through modulation of FGF23, but human data remain sparse. P also elevates parathyroid hormone (PTH), which predicts CVD mortality and presence of cerebral infarcts. Second, vitamin B6 (B6), a critical cofactor for ≥100 metabolic reactions, is easily lost with food processing and unlike other B vitamins is not added back to enriched grains. We have shown that low B6 status was associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and depressive symptoms in Puerto Rican adults. Earlier work with non-Hispanic white men, showed associations of both diet and plasma B6 (pyridoxl-5'-phosphate,PLP) with 3 y cognitive decline. Latinos appear to be disproportionately burdened by cognitive impairment compared to non-Hispanic whites. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that Puerto Ricans have >twice the odds of low global cognitive function compared to Mexicans. With the growing and aging Latino population in the U.S likely to contribute to major increases in the burden of cognitive decline, it is critical that we improve our understanding of preventive risk factors that may inform interventions. We will use data from the Boston Puerto Rican Health study (BPRHS), a longitudinal cohort study of U.S. mainland Puerto Ricans (45-74 y) with diet, nutritional biomarkers, and cognitive function testing data available at baseline and 2 and 5 y follow-up. We will recruit BPRHS participants to return (~ 8-y from baseline) for a repeat battery of cognitive exams and, for a subset, an MRI scan. We will quantify the associations between processed foods consumption, P status (serum P, FGF23, klotho, and PTH), dietary B6, and PLP, as exposures, with ~8 y cognitive decline (psychometric testing) and brain structure, cerebral infarcts, white matter integrity, and connectivity (MRI) at ~8 y, as outcomes. Further the potential mediative roles of inflammation (CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) will be measured. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive decline is an increasing health concern among U.S. Latino adults, particularly those of Puerto Rican heritage. The proposed project aims to quantify the importance of highly processed foods consumption and phosphorus and vitamin B6 status in relation to cognitive decline (psychometric testing) and brain health (MRI) among older U.S. mainland Puerto Rican adults. With the growing and aging Latino population in the U.S likely to contribute to major increases in the burden of cognitive decline, these data will provide critical information to improve our understanding of preventive risk factors that may inform interventions.","Dietary Quality, Cognitive Decline and Brain Health in Puerto Rican Adults",9932871,R01AG055948,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ',

"Influence of Dietary Pattern and Race on Metabolic and Epigenetic Alterations Associated with Cancer Development Abstract  African Americans suffer disparities in risk of gastrointestinal cancers, which are etiologically linked with inflammation. Dietary and other behavioral factors, rather than genetic, likely play a dominant role in explaining the disparity, as incidence of gastrointestinal cancers is much lower in rural Africans. Vegetarians in the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) cohort were found to have decreased risk for colorectal and gastrointestinal cancers relative to omnivores. Additionally, vegetarians have lower concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, and higher levels of anti-inflammatory bioactive compounds. Thus, habitual vegetarian and omnivorous dietary patterns may differentially regulate inflammation. However, there is a need for identification of other diet- related metabolites and molecular processes that influence inflammation and consequently cancer.  The metabolome and DNA methylome are profoundly altered in cancer and also impacted by select foods or dietary conditions. However, it is unclear how they are influenced by dietary patterns characterized by consumption of plant- or animal-based foods. African Americans, who tend to have poorer nutrient profiles and dietary behaviors, have different metabolic and epigenetic signatures from Caucasians. Thus, these differences could be partly explained by diet. Secondary polyphenol and other plant-derived metabolites may prevent inflammation, while oxidative and energy-related metabolites that accumulate with consumption of animal-based foods may promote chronic inflammation. These different metabolite profiles may be characterized by opposing global or gene-specific alterations in methylation that influence genome stability and expression of cancer-relevant genes. Methyl-donating metabolites (folate, choline, and methionine) associated with a wide variety of foods influence cancer, but findings have not been consistent. It is plausible that the precise methylation activity of methyl donor and other metabolites is largely dependent on inflammatory status, which itself has been found to regulate methylation, and is defined by dietary pattern.  Using blood samples from vegetarians and omnivores in the AHS-2 cohort, specific aims will examine the independent influences of dietary pattern and race on plasma metabolites and gene methylation, and determine if the effect of dietary patterns on these biomarker profiles is different in African Americans relative to Caucasians. In addition, correlations between a priori candidate, diet-associated metabolites and genes relevant to inflammation and cancer will be examined. The proposed project will provide new training in molecular epidemiology, genomics, and health disparities research. Activities for training include workshops, conferences, short courses, and seminars, along with grant writing classes and working groups. Research will be facilitated by the expertise of mentors experienced in experimental nutrition and metabolomics, statistical methodology and epidemiology, and cancer biology and health disparities, in conjunction with collaborating scientists with additional expertise in bioinformatics and epigenetics. Narrative Dietary patterns impact the metabolome and consequently inflammation, possibly regulating cancer development through alterations in the DNA methylome. This research will examine the independent and combined influences of dietary pattern (vegetarian vs omnivorous) and race on metabolic and epigenetic alterations, and subsequently, metabolite-methylation associations among healthy participants of the Adventist Health Study-2 cohort. This study will elucidate the role of dietary patterns in cancer disparities, and ultimately foster the development of effective interventions for cancer prevention.",Influence of Dietary Pattern and Race on Metabolic and Epigenetic Alterations Associated with Cancer Development,9977535,K01MD015194,"['Animal Feed ', ' animal food ', ' Animals ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' antiinflammatory ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carotenoids ', ' Carotenes and Carotenoids ', ' carotenoid biosynthesis ', ' Choline ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Omega-3 Fatty Acids ', ' Omega-3 PUFA ', ' Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid ', ' Omega3 ', ' n-3 Fatty Acids ', ' omega-3 ', ' ω-3 fatty acids ', ' Folic Acid ', ' Folate ', ' Pteroylglutamic Acid ', ' Vitamin M ', ' vitamin Bc ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' alimentary tract ', ' digestive canal ', ' Genes ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Isoflavones ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methionine ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Plants ', ' Edible Plants ', ' Food Plants ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Writing ', ' enterolactone ', ' polyphenol ', ' cytokine ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Chronic ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Cell Cycle Genes ', ' Cell Division Cycle Genes ', ' cdc Genes ', ' Funding ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' CpG-Rich Islands ', ' CpG Islands ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' vegan ', ' veganism ', ' Vegan Diet ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' colorectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' experience ', ' tumor suppressor ', ' Tumor Suppressor Proteins ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' Familiarity ', ' Nutrient ', ' Participant ', ' GI cancers ', ' GI malignancies ', ' GI tract cancers ', ' Gastrointestinal Cancer ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract Cancer ', ' Malignant Gastrointestinal Neoplasm ', ' gastrointestinal malignancies ', ' Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Genomic Stability ', ' Genome Stability ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Biomarker of Dietary Intake ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Hypermethylation ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Experimental Nutrition ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Consumption ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' effective intervention ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' global methylation ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' methylome ', ' methylation pattern ', ' metabonome ', ' metabolome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' inflammatory environment ', ' inflammatory milieu ', ' colo-rectal cancer risk ', ' colorectal cancer risk ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIMHD,LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,120374,0.09123168936141797
"The Food Allergy Superheroes Training (FAST) Program: Increasing Adherence to Food Allergy Safety Guidelines Food Allergies (FA) are a growing health crisis affecting approximately 2.0 million young children (i.e., < 8 years of age) in the United States. Strict avoidance (e.g., elimination of allergenic foods from one’s diet) is the only intervention capable of preventing potentially devasting health-related sequelae including anaphylaxis and death. Adhering to recommendations for strict avoidance (i.e., not ingesting, touching, or playing with potentially allergenic food) is challenging for young children. Youths from disadvantaged backgrounds (i.e., low socioeconomic status) are particularly impacted by FAs (i.e., greater financial burden, increased risk of complications); thus, it is critical that adherence-promoting interventions take into account SES-related disparities. Behavioral Skills Training (BST) is a brief (i.e., <5 sessions, 15-20 min/session), portable, skills- based, and engaging intervention designed to educate, reinforce through modeling, provide praise/corrective feedback, and practice (i.e., rehearsal) the skills necessary for children to remain adherent to safety-related behaviors. Prior research has shown BST superior to education alone. The primary aim of this R21 proposal is to test the efficacy of a 5-session intervention designed to increase adherence to FA safety guidelines among low-income, young children (6-8 years of age) with FAs. This intervention, the Food Allergy Superheroes Training (FAST) Program, will be developed and refined across Phases 1a and 1b to target skills beneficial to promote adherence to FA guidelines (i.e., food avoidance). During Phase 1a, we will recruit a parent-child advisory board to aide in integrating principles of BST within the FAST Program manual. We will then examine the initial acceptability and feasibility of the FAST Program in an open trial with 10 low-income, young children with FAs to further refine the intervention’s content. During Phase 1b, we will randomize 50 young children with a FA who are from a low-income background to receive either the FAST Program or FA knowledge. We will employ developmentally relevant FA assessments (i.e., child-report, role-play, in situ) before, after, and one- month post-intervention as our primary outcomes. Aim 1: Determine feasibility and acceptability of the FAST intervention. We will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention with 60 participants (n=10 in pilot trial [Phase 1a] and n=50 in a preliminary randomized trial [Phase 1b]). Aim 2: Estimate the effect size of the FAST intervention relative to FA knowledge alone. Adherence will be measured via a multi-modal, FA assessment including child-report, role-play, and in situ assessment. This form of naturalistic, FA assessment will be designed to measure the child’s behavior (i.e., ingest food, touch or play with food, etc.) in a safe yet realistic manner. This study will contribute to the field’s knowledge of efficacious interventions for promoting adherence among young children with FAs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Among children with a food allergy, strict avoidance (e,g, elimination of allergenic foods from one’s diet) is the only intervention capable of preventing potentially devasting health-related sequelae including anaphylaxis and death.

Data collected as part of the proposed project will lay the groundwork for a line of federally-funded intervention research broadly examining how to promote adherence to food allergy safety guidelines among young children from low-income backgrounds through implementation of a robust, efficient, and portable intervention.",The Food Allergy Superheroes Training (FAST) Program: Increasing Adherence to Food Allergy Safety Guidelines,9969521,R21HD098450,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Allergens ', ' Anaphylaxis ', ' Anaphylactic Reaction ', ' Anaphylactic Shock ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Fires ', ' fire ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergic to food ', ' Allergy to food ', ' Food Allergy ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Manuals ', ' Nuts ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Training Programs ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Ingestion ', ' Funding ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' In Situ ', ' skills training ', ' rehearsal ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' pilot trial ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' injured child ', ' injured children ', ' injury in children ', ' pediatric injury ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' Population ', ' 7 years of age ', ' age 7 years ', ' seven year old ', ' seven years of age ', ' 7 year old ', ' 8 years of age ', ' age 8 years ', ' eight year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' 8 year old ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' primary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' firearm injury ', ' Gun injury ', ' recruit ', ' food avoidance ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' ']",NICHD,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,196168,0.23483147614368746
"The Impact of the Food Environment and Other Environmental Exposures on the Risk of Diabetes in Rural Settings PROJECT SUMMARY Though diabetes prevalence has increased nationally, geographic disparities have widened with higher diabetes-related mortality in rural regions than in urban areas. Evidence suggests that an unhealthy food environment increases diabetes risk in urban areas, but crude measures of the food environment may not capture the risk of rural diabetes. Therefore, robust analyses of the food environment and rural diabetes must measure exposures at the correct geographic scale and quantify how certain food purchases can increase diabetes risk. The hazards of the food environment not only include an unhealthy imbalance of macronutrients, but also dietary chemical exposures such as bisphenols and phthalates. These chemicals are now recognized as endocrine disruptors that may promote insulin resistance and diabetes. Though previous studies of diabetes risk have explored poor diet quality and dietary contaminants in isolation of each other, this study seeks to compare the combined impact of both hazards on diabetes risk among rural residents. To accomplish this goal, the study will obtain detailed dietary data through food frequency questionnaires and receipts of food purchases, measure estimated daily intake and urinary levels of bisphenols and phthalates, and use point-of- care HbA1c testing to identify key risk factors associated with rural diabetes. The study setting will be Sullivan County, New York, a rural county with the second-to-worst health ranking and rate of premature death in New York State, and also a high burden of diabetes. Though not representative of all rural regions, the impoverished, predominately White rural population of Sullivan County is an understudied group at high risk for poor diabetic outcomes. Therefore, the specific aims of this study will be to: 1) determine whether the diet quality of rural residents is influenced by their geographic locations and characteristics of their local food environment, 2) calculate estimated daily intake of bisphenols and phthalates based on the food consumption patterns of rural residents and compare results to urinary levels of these chemicals, and 3) use point-of-care HbA1c tests to identify how poor diet quality and dietary contaminants affect glycemic control among rural residents without a prior diagnosis of diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rural residents experience substantial barriers in accessing healthy foods, but may also be exposed to other hazards of their local food environment through chemical contaminants ingested from dietary sources. This study will perform geographically detailed surveillance in rural Sullivan County, New York to identify how diet quality and dietary contaminants may interact to increase diabetes risk in rural communities. Findings will inform strategies to improve dietary behavior, reduce dietary chemical exposures, and prevent diabetes among rural residents.",The Impact of the Food Environment and Other Environmental Exposures on the Risk of Diabetes in Rural Settings,9942892,R01DK124400,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Economics ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Analysis ', ' Food Analyses ', ' Food Supply ', ' Canned Foods ', ' Foundations ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Joints ', ' mortality ', ' New York ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Population ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' bisphenol A ', ' diphenylolpropane ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Rural Community ', ' phthalates ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Chemicals ', ' Ingestion ', ' Rural ', ' diabetic ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Food Packaging ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Exposure to ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' diabetes risk ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Macronutrients ', ' Macronutrients Nutrition ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' urinary ', ' point of care ', ' food consumption ', ' cost ', ' Endocrine Disrupter ', ' Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals ', ' Endocrine disrupting agent ', ' endocrine disrupting compound ', ' Endocrine Disruptors ', ' Food Access ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' food environment ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' rural resident ', ' rural dwellers ', ' rural counties ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' rural setting ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,735182,0.19969680594298664
"A pragmatic randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of medically tailored meals and medical nutrition therapy via telehealth among patients with poorly controlled diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the availability of evidence-based guidance and treatments, many patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) do not achieve optimal glycemic control. In prior work, patients with DM identified primary needs of improved access to food and nutrition education. Several innovative models for food services have emerged to address patient needs for improved healthy food access. Currently, select non-profit organizations across the U.S. deliver millions of medically-tailored meals (MTM) to patients with chronic illnesses, based on the premise that food can be as helpful as medicine in improving patient outcomes. While a handful of pilot studies have demonstrated success of MTM in reducing healthcare utilization and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) among patients with DM, no randomized trials have assessed the sustained impact of MTM on long-term outcomes for patients with DM. Similarly, individual studies of medical nutrition therapy (MNT), which includes individualized nutrition education and counseling, have shown benefit for improving DM outcomes. However, uptake of MNT across health systems has historically been extremely limited because of patient logistical barriers to attending the in- person visits. MNT delivered by telehealth (tele-MNT) has potential to overcome these barriers. Our goal is to evaluate the effect of MTM, with and without additional tele-MNT, on outcomes for patients with poorly controlled type 2 DM. We will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with patients who have poorly controlled DM. Outcomes of interest include change in HbA1c, cost effectiveness, weight, diabetes self- efficacy, self-care, diabetes quality of life, and patient satisfaction. We will assess the efficacy of 1) MTM and 2) MTM + tele-MNT compared to usual care in reducing HbA1c at 3, 6 (primary outcome) and 12 months and the cost effectiveness of each intervention compared to usual care up to 12 months. We will also explore patient perspectives regarding experiences with MTM and MTM + tele-MNT to gain a better understanding of potential factors contributing to treatment failure and success within each group. The proposed research is innovative because it develops and tests a novel tele-MNT intervention tailored to recipients of MTM, provides a comprehensive solution to patient-identified nutrition needs, includes complete utilization data provided by the HealthShare Exchange, and leverages a unique health system and community group partnership to improve sustainability and scalability. Study results will inform 1) provider and payor decisions regarding offering and covering these services; 2) how services should be structured for scalability; and 3) integration of these services into the larger care delivery system to reduce DM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE This pragmatic randomized controlled trial will assess the efficacy of medically tailored meals and medical nutrition therapy via telehealth on clinical outcomes for patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The goal of these interventions is to improve outcomes for patients with diabetes by impacting self-care behaviors and diet self-efficacy in the short and long term. This study leverages a unique health system and community group partnership to inform the utility of reimbursement for medically tailored meal programs and medical nutrition therapy, which would ultimately facilitate their scalability and sustainability within the healthcare system.",A pragmatic randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of medically tailored meals and medical nutrition therapy via telehealth among patients with poorly controlled diabetes,9979850,R18DK118590,"['Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' assess cost ', ' cost assessment ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Services ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' nutrition ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Schedule ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' diet education ', ' nutrition education ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Logistics ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Medical Nutrition Therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' telehealth ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Diet and Nutrition ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Food Access ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' routine practice ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' care costs ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIDDK,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R18,2020,663140,0.09862558046595973
"Effects of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on racial/ethnic and disability-based healthcare disparities Project Summary/Abstract  This project will examine the impact of losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits on healthcare outcomes and healthcare disparities based on race/ethnicity and disability. Racial/ethnic minorities and people with disabilities experience healthcare disparities in the areas of disease prevention and management, unfavorable clinical events, and acute healthcare expenditures. Food insecurity may affect these disparities: food insecure individuals forgo needed care and medications more often, use emergency and inpatient care more often, and require higher expenditures than food secure individuals. Meanwhile, racial/ethnic minorities and people with disabilities are 2.2 and 2.8 times as likely to be food insecure as non- minorities and people without disabilities, respectively, face starker tradeoffs between food and resources such as housing, and have greater sensitivity to food insecurity given greater economic and health vulnerabilities.  SNAP has been shown to reduce food insecurity and is disproportionately utilized by racial/ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. SNAP policy changes could therefore affect healthcare outcomes for racial/ethnic minorities and people with disabilities in different ways than for others. For example, initial studies by our team and others suggest SNAP may reduce poor healthcare outcomes and Medicaid expenditures, particularly for people with disabilities. However, these studies were limited to population-level or cross- sectional data, and all studied non-random changes to SNAP. Further, no studies have examined the effects of SNAP on healthcare disparities empirically. In this project, we exploit a natural experiment in which arbitrary errors in the Massachusetts eligibility evaluation system caused 75,200 SNAP recipients to receive arbitrary terminations despite actually still being eligible. Moreover, because of recent legislation in the state, we will have access to comprehensive longitudinal SNAP, medical claims, and other public health data on the entire state population. Using these linked data and growth curve modeling, we will examine the impact of losing SNAP benefits on healthcare outcomes and disparities related to disease prevention and management (Aim 1), unfavorable clinical events (Aim 2), and healthcare expenditures (Aim 3). We hypothesize SNAP losses are associated with worse healthcare outcomes and elevated racial/ethnic and disability-based disparities.  Cuts to SNAP benefits are routinely debated, but there is limited information on how benefit losses for current recipients would affect healthcare outcomes. Our study will help fill this gap. More broadly, programs like SNAP target determinants of health and healthcare disparities, yet their potential effects on these outcomes have received minimal study. By adding to this literature, our analyses will further the NIH Health Disparities Strategic Plan’s goal of supporting “research on the factors underlying health disparities.” Project Narrative Food insecurity is widespread in the United States and is associated with worsened healthcare outcomes, particularly for racial/ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the “Food Stamp Program”) has been shown to reduce food insecurity, but little is known about the relationship between SNAP and healthcare outcomes and disparities, with no studies using rigorous causal methods on individual-level data. Capitalizing on a natural experiment created when tens of thousands of Massachusetts SNAP recipients had their benefits arbitrarily terminated due to errors in the state’s eligibility evaluation system, as well as a unique set of linked SNAP, Medicaid, and public health department data from Massachusetts, this project will examine the effects of SNAP on preventive healthcare utilization (Aim 1), unfavorable clinical events (Aim 2), and healthcare expenditures (Aim 3).",Effects of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on racial/ethnic and disability-based healthcare disparities,9972641,R01MD013837,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Budgets ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Housing ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Literature ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nutrition ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Population Programs ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research Support ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' food resource ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' cooking ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' trend ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' inpatient care ', ' inpatient service ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Secure ', ' operation ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' health data ', ' Preventative health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' food insecurity ', ' ']",NIMHD,ALTAMED HEALTH SERVICES CORPORATION,R01,2020,500000,0.19411796771096282
"FOOD (Food to Overcome Outcomes Disparities) Project Summary The World Health Organization defines food security as having access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life. Food security includes both physical and economic access to food that meets people's dietary needs and preferences. The 18-item, 12-month time-referenced U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module (USDA) categorizes individuals as having high food security, marginal food security, low food security, or very low food security. Food insecurity is growing in the U.S., with an overall prevalence of 12.7% (low and very low food security). The prevalence of food insecurity among immigrant and minority communities exceeds the national average. Food insecurity is associated with non-adherence to treatment. Food-insecure patients are more likely to postpone care and often cannot afford prescribed medication(s). Food-insecure patients have significantly higher levels of nutritional risk, depression, financial strain, and lower quality of life. Nutrition interventions result in enhanced quality of life. Cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to both food insecurity and its impact, due to the intensity of treatment protocols and the disease process itself. A study among a cohort of underserved cancer patients in New York City showed that 56% were food insecure, with 38% of the cohort with very low food security. Treatment adherence is an important determinant of survival among cancer patients. However, among ethnic minority cancer patients, unmet socioeconomic and supportive care needs are associated with patient-reported missed radiation, and/or chemotherapy appointments. Food insecurity potentially acts as a mediating factor, as functional, social, and emotional well-being decrease significantly with increasing food insecurity. Prior to our work, there had been only one study examining food insecurity in cancer patients. There is to date no evidence base on interventions to address food insecurity, and their potential to ameliorate cancer and other chronic disease treatment completion disparities. Food to Overcome Outcomes Disparities (FOOD) addresses this gap as the first large study of its kind to examine food interventions in vulnerable populations and their impact on breast cancer treatment completion. Results have the potential to guide program and policy change. FOOD will utilize a three arm randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of a hospital-based medically tailored food pantry (Pantry) versus a food voucher program (Voucher) versus a home grocery delivery program (Delivery) on cancer treatment completion. FOOD is a partnership between the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) Immigrant Health and Cancer Disparities (IHCD) Service, the Food Bank for New York City, the New York City Council, the New York City Health and Hospitals, God's Love We Deliver, and Saint Barnabas Hospital. This study builds upon the foundation laid by a seminal pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial, which examined a scalable, clinic-based food pantry, a food voucher program, and home grocery delivery. Project Narrative This is the first study to address the impact of food insecurity among the growing underserved, and immigrant and minority, breast cancer patient population in active treatment for cure. The FOOD study builds upon the team's unique approaches to addressing and studying food insecurity and cancer treatment completion, including implementing food pantries co-located within oncology clinics and studying the impact of a pilot food voucher program and a home grocery delivery program. FOOD has the potential to significantly improve the growing issues of food insecurity and barriers to emergency food resources that hamper breast cancer treatment completion among medically underserved populations in New York City, and across the nation in large metropolitan areas.",FOOD (Food to Overcome Outcomes Disparities),9920682,R01CA230446,"['Appointment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Kentucky ', ' Love ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' food resource ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Saints ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Feels well ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' psychological wellness ', ' self wellness ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' Well in self ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' Radiation ', ' voucher ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically underserved population ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Intake ', ' Interruption ', ' MSKCC ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Seminal ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' active method ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' food security ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' chemotherapy ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' treatment adherence ', ' arm ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' minority communities ', ' intervention cost ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' food insecurity ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2020,213924,0.3032878878098982
"Impact of Disparities in Food Security on Glycemic Control and Health Care Utilization Among Youth and Young Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Despite recent advances in therapy, far too many youth and young adults (YYAs) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly those of minority race/ethnicity, do not achieve optimal glycemic control thus placing them at increased risk of acute and chronic complications. Among the social determinants of health, household food insecurity (HFI) may be a key barrier to achieving glycemic control and may lead to increased health care utilization and costs, but virtually all of the limited research was cross-sectional and conducted in older adults with T2D. Moreover, racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by HFI, which may underlie similar disparities in diabetes outcomes. Our preliminary work suggests that HFI is a common phenomenon in YYAs with diabetes, affecting 19% of YYAs with T1D and 38% of those with T2D. These rates significantly exceed the 2015 national estimate of 12.7%. We propose a longitudinal study, the SEARCH Food Security (SFS) cohort study, which is designed as an ancillary study to the ongoing CDC/DDT- and NIH/NIDDK-funded SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth 4 study, a racially/ethnically diverse study of diabetes diagnosed in youth. The aims of the SFS study are to: (1) Initiate a food insecurity cohort study of 1,187 YYAs aged 15-35 years (53% minority) with T1D and T2D by adding two data collection time points to the ongoing SEARCH 4 study; (2) Prospectively evaluate the influence of HFI on changes in glycemic control in YYAs with T1D and T2D; (3) Quantify the mediating role of nutritional, mental health, and behavioral pathways through which food insecurity may affect changes in glycemic control in YYAs with T1D and T2D; and (4) Prospectively evaluate the influence of HFI on changes in health care utilization and medical and non-medical health care costs in YYAs with T1D and T2D. Using the SFS data in tandem with extensive data collected by SEARCH will be highly efficient for addressing these aims. The proposed study will be the first cohort study to examine the impact of food insecurity on glycemic control, health care utilization, and costs among a diverse population of US YYAs with T1D and T2D. Our transdisciplinary team is led by Drs. Liese and Mendoza, recognized experts in diabetes, epidemiology, pediatric medicine, disparities, and food insecurity research, and is supported by a team comprising expertise in pediatric endocrinology, psychology, health behaviors, health economics, biostatistics, and causal inference modeling. The study has the potential to alter diabetes policy and clinical practice by establishing the need for more in-depth assessments of food insecurity among YYAs with diabetes, re-assessment of diabetes management and nutrition recommendations for food-insecure patients, and integration of food assistance resources into routine care for persons with diabetes.

"Nutrition to Optimize, Understand, and Restore Insulin Sensitivity in HIV for Oklahoma (NOURISH OK) Project Summary / Abstract  The Nutrition to Optimize, Understand, and Restore Insulin Sensitivity in HIV for Oklahoma (NOURISH-OK) Study uses a cross-cutting research design that is widely-applicable to the prevention and treatment of many chronic co-morbidities in HIV disease. It uses a community-based participatory orientation to maximize inclusion of minorities and other underrepresented populations, which also ensures study findings will be relevant, actionable, and yield the greatest potential for reducing health disparities. Broadly, NOURISH-OK will elucidate nutritional and non-nutritional behavioral risk pathways linking food insecurity to insulin resistance among low- income people living with HIV. Its primary focus will be rigorous evaluation and manipulation of dietary intake as an influential pathway, which is complemented by secondary investigation of additional biological pathways, including chronic inflammation and microbiome. The study will be conducted in Oklahoma, and include HIV- positive individuals living in urban and rural communities. It is comprised of three aims. First, the research team will test and refine a conceptual integrated framework of food insecurity and insulin resistance to identify significant structural, social, behavioral, and biological pathways as candidate intervention points. This aim will be accomplished using a cross-sectional survey (n=500) and a one-month observational sub-study from the main study sample (n=100) to collect intensive measures of dietary intake and gut microbiome samples. Data analysis will adjust for measurement error in dietary intake using replicate recalls from the sub-study. Structural equation modeling will be used to test the study’s overall conceptual multi-level framework of food insecurity and insulin resistance. Second, the research team will then adapt a home-delivered grocery and cooking self-care NOURISH-OK intervention to address key nutrition disparities and other health risk behaviors identified as significant path contributors to insulin resistance among people living with HIV. This adaptation will be informed by findings from the first aim, and further refined and finalized through a series of interviews and focus groups with people living with HIV who are food insecure (n=56 qualitative study subjects). Third, the research team will implement the 12-week NOURISH-OK intervention and assess it for feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact using a randomized wait-list control design (n=270). This study will use a simple randomized wait-list control trial design with stratification by geography (urban/rural) and further stratification in the urban group by low and very low food security status. Primary study outcomes include insulin resistance, along with multiple secondary outcomes that are also strongly relevant to the mission of NIDDK. These secondary outcomes include dietary intake and nutritional status, chronic inflammation, health risk behaviors, including tobacco use, physical inactivity, and inadequate sleep, and microbiome composition changes. Project Narrative  The NOURISH-OK Study will identify how food insecurity contributes to insulin resistance, an important surrogate marker of many co-morbidities in HIV disease, using an integrated framework to identify key leverage points for insulin resistance. Drawing from these pathways, this study will adapt and evaluate a community-driven, science-informed “food as medicine” intervention designed to lower insulin resistance through healthy food access, food utilization skills, and other self-care behaviors. Knowledge gained from this study can benefit those living with HIV through the prevention and more effective management of pre-diabetes, diabetes, obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","Nutrition to Optimize, Understand, and Restore Insulin Sensitivity in HIV for Oklahoma (NOURISH OK)",10132533,R01DK127464,"['Behavior ', ' Body Composition ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity

"Designing and Evaluating High-Impact Pictorial Health Warnings for Food Products PROJECT ABSTRACT Poor diet and obesity are major causes of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Requiring pictorial health warnings on the front of food packaging is a promising yet understudied policy to reduce dietary risk factors for CVD. This strategy has potential to improve public health, including among Latinos, the largest minority group in the US. The goal of my proposed research and training is to design pictorial food health warnings to reduce dietary risk factors for CVD, with attention to the effects among Latinos with low English proficiency (LEP). In Aim 1, I will develop English-language pictorial food health warnings linking nutrients (i.e., saturated fat, sodium, sugar) with CVD consequences, with guidance from a panel of experts in nutrition, cardiovascular health, and law. I will pre-test the resulting food health warnings in focus groups with US adults, including LEP Latinos. In a discrete choice experiment, I will select the final warnings for use in Aims 2 and 3. In Aim 2, I will evaluate whether pictorial warnings increase healthfulness of virtual food purchases in a virtual shopping experiment. I will randomly assign a sample of US adults (half LEP Latinos and half non-Latinos) to view pictorial warnings or control labels on food products in a virtual supermarket and will test whether pictorial warnings increase healthfulness of virtual food purchases (i.e., reduce calories, saturated fat, sugar, and sodium of purchases). I will also examine whether LEP status moderates the impact of pictorial warnings on food purchases. I expect the impact of pictorial warnings will be stronger among LEP Latinos than non-Latinos because the images paired with text will better communicate risk than text alone. Finally, in Aim 3, I will randomly assign US adults to view pictorial warnings or control labels and will assess whether pictorial warnings increase objectively-measured physiological responses to warnings including attention (i.e., dwell time, measured with eye tracking) and negative emotion (i.e., frowning and hand sweating, measured with electrodes). This research addresses NHLBI's strategic goal of reducing CVD, as well as the Institute's overarching objective to investigate factors that account for health disparities. The K01 will help me achieve my long-term career goal of becoming a leader in behavioral research to inform obesity prevention policy, with a focus on Latino health disparities. With support from this career development award, I will build an independent research program to improve understanding of how to design effective policies to prevent poor diets and diet-related obesity. Specifically, the K01 will allow me to address training gaps in 1) modifiable dietary determinants of CVD, with a focus on Latino disparities, 2) discrete choice experiments, and 3) eye tracking methodology. My training plan includes apprenticeships with my interdisciplinary mentorship team, formal coursework, hands-on research activities, and participation in national conferences, research groups, and professional societies. The K01 will provide me with the experience necessary to become an independent researcher capable of successfully competing for R01 funding to continue work in this area.

"Dietary Quality Indexes and Cancer Risk: the Multiethnic Cohort Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diet quality indexes (DQIs) have been developed to assess dietary patterns, in contrast to a single nutrient or food, by using a hypothesis-oriented methodology. This index-based approach to dietary patterns addresses the complexity of diet, multicollinearity between dietary components, and can be readily translated into dietary recommendations. Recently, we calculated key DQIs for each participant in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC): the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015), the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010), the alternate Mediterranean diet (aMED) score, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, and the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII). Although these indexes have been applied to evaluate the relationship of overall diet to health outcomes including our studies on colorectal cancer in the MEC, there are limited studies addressing racial/ethnic groups other than whites, less common cancers, changes in diet quality over time, and possibility of a novel dietary pattern derived for an ethnically diverse population. To address these gaps, we will utilize the MEC that consists of more than 215,000 adults (55% women) aged 45-75 years; self-reporting as African American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, Latinos, or white; and completed a comprehensive survey including a validated, quantitative food frequency questionnaire (QFFQ) at cohort entry in 1993-1996. The MEC has been periodically linked to tumor registries and death files. In 2003-2007, 46% of the MEC participants completed the repeated QFFQ. The five DQIs are computed for both the baseline and the 10-year follow-up QFFQs. Specific aims to capitalize on these unique data sets include investigate the associations of the five DQIs with risk of 13 common sites of cancer (bladder, breast, endometrium, kidney, liver, lung, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovary, pancreas, prostate, stomach, and thyroid) and the interplay between DQIs in cancer prevention. Next, we will examine the changes in DQIs and their associations with risk of major cancers (breast, colorectum, lung, and prostate) and mortality from all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Our third aim is to develop a novel dietary pattern by exploring DQI components and scoring schemes as well as unique dietary features in the MEC, and validate it by examining its association with cancer risk and mortality. As dietary patterns have not been sufficiently explored for a potential anti-cancer link particularly in racial/ethnic groups other than whites, the proposed work offers a unique opportunity especially for under-studied cancers and racial/ethnic groups. The project will produce a novel dietary pattern for a multiethnic population, and ultimately could influence dietary recommendations and practices for cancer prevention and healthy aging in older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE This application will advance current knowledge on the role of overall diet quality in cancer prevention especially for under-studied cancers and racial/ethnic groups, and the effect of changes in diet quality on subsequent risk of cancer and mortality in older adults. In addition, the project will produce a novel dietary pattern for a multiethnic population, and thus could ultimately influence dietary recommendations and practices for cancer prevention and healthy aging.",Dietary Quality Indexes and Cancer Risk: the Multiethnic Cohort Study,9839494,R03CA223890,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Coffee ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Endometrium ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Japanese American ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', "" Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' Nonhodgkins Lymphoma ', ' non-Hodgkins disease ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Ovary ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stomach ', ' gastric ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' colorectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' cohort ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer site ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Mediterranean Diet ', ' Address ', ' Dietary Component ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Scheme ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' tumor registry ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Consumption ', ' soy ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' tumor ', ' healthy aging ', ' Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ', ' Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet ', ' DASH diet ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' anticancer ', ' anti-cancer ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R03,2020,77000,0.08228713064797288
"Federal School Nutrition Policies, Student Food Insecurity and BMI Project Abstract Obesity in childhood increases the risk of the leading forms of chronic diseases in adulthood (e.g., cardiometabolic disease and cancer) that cause premature mortality in the U.S. Prevention of childhood life food insecurity and nutritional deficiencies implicated in this cascade of disease, disability and mortality has been the primary objective of the USDA free and reduced price meal (FRPM) programs for over six decades. Unfortunately, there has been increasing (albeit mixed) evidence to suggest that such programs may actually contribute to child obesity in low-income populations. The 2012 Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act (HHFKA) was designed to improve the nutritional quality of school foods and beverages and the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) of the legislation allows schools serving predominantly low-income populations to offer free meals to all students. The proposed project will be the first to exploit these two federal policies offer to design natural experiments to test hypotheses about the impact of FRPM on food insecurity, child body mass index (BMI) and disparities in child BMI trajectories. The project specific aims are to: 1) use national policy changes in FRPM (i.e., HHFKA and CEP) to better understand how changes in meal nutritional requirements and FRPM participation affects children's food security and BMI trajectories; 2) evaluate whether food insecurity mediates the effect of FRPM on BMI trajectories; and 3) examine the impact of HHFKA and CEP policy changes in FRPM on disparities in Aims 1 and 2 by race/ethnicity and maternal nativity. We achieve these objectives using large nationally representative, ethnically diverse longitudinal data that span pre- and post-HHFKA and CEP implementation from two surveys in the National Center for Education Statistics' Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) program, i.e. the ECLS-K:2011, (n=18,200) and the ECLS-K (n= 22,782). Both surveys followed children from kindergarten through at least 5th grade collecting rich data on school meal participation, food insecurity, socioeconomic status and students' measured height and weight. We will use a general panel model estimated using structural equation models for that allows us to flexibly examine and test the assumptions we make in structuring our analyses as natural experiments. We also incorporate novel (multi-level and panel) extensions to propensity score matching to improve balance between `treated' and `untreated' children in these natural experiments. The results are expected to improve our understanding of how school meal programs impact children across school contexts, where access is lacking, and will help inform how federal school meal policies may effectively support health in all children. Project narrative We propose to use two nationally representative samples of children, leveraging national policy changes in Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act and the Community Eligibility Provision to better understand how changes in meal nutritional requirements and access to school meals affects children's food security and BMI trajectories. Data will be analyzed using difference in difference and structural modeling approaches to test the impact of these natural experiments on child BMI trajectory indirectly through food insecurity.

"Effectiveness and Implementation of a Research Tested Mobile Produce Market Designed to Improve Diet in Underserved Communities Abstract Lower-income and minority groups face significant health disparities with respect to obesity, cancer, heart disease and other diet-related chronic conditions. Poor diets, low in fruits and vegetables (F&V) and high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar, contribute to many of the health problems faced by vulnerable groups. While socioeconomic status and other individual level factors (i.e., food preferences, time and skills to prepare healthy food, etc.) can lead to reduced F&V consumption, these must be viewed in an environmental context. Compared with higher-income neighborhoods, lower-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to have stores that sell a variety of F&V and other healthy foods. And when stores are available, produce may not be affordable, high quality or culturally appropriate. Farmers' markets and mobile produce markets (MM) have become increasingly popular strategies to alleviate food access concerns in underserved communities. However, it is unclear if these programs have the necessary components to have an appreciable impact on diet. Our research team recently completed one of the first randomized controlled trials of a MM program called the Veggie Van. Veggie Van was run in partnership with our team and a small non-profit organization in North Carolina; it delivered boxes of fresh, locally grown produce and food-focused education to communities with significant barriers to F&V consumption including availability, affordability, quality and knowledge. In this small cluster-randomized trial in 12 communities (N=201), we saw impressive changes in F&V intake with intervention participants eating almost 1 more cups per day of F&Vs than the control group. Intervention participants also reported increases in perceived access to healthy foods and Veggie Van customers attributed many dietary changes to the MM program. While these results are very promising, we believe it is important to test the effectiveness of the Veggie Van program when implemented by different organizations in multiple communities. If shown to be effective, we can create a research-tested intervention toolkit which can be disseminated to communities across the country. For this research, we will use a request for proposals process to identify 8 organizations nationwide that are well-qualified to implement the Veggie Van model. Organizations will identify appropriate sites for MM deliveries (32 total) and we will randomize them to either an implementation or planning condition. With the help of our team's technical assistance and provided funding, partner organizations will engage community members in the process and initiate a MM program. We will use a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation to measure effectiveness (diet, BMI, dermal carotenoids) and implementation (customer reach and sales, process measures, qualitative interviews with MM staff). We will also examine sustainability of MM financial models and determine implementation standards (i.e., dose needed to maintain impact) for inclusion in our MM toolkit for future dissemination. Narrative Our research demonstrated that a mobile produce market can have a significant positive impact on diets of residents in lower-income communities. We want to test this program more widely to determine if the effect can be replicated and develop a best-practices toolkit to help others sustainably implement the program.",Effectiveness and Implementation of a Research Tested Mobile Produce Market Designed to Improve Diet in Underserved Communities,9828776,R37CA215232,"['Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' North Carolina ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Sales ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Businesses ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Process Measure ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' diet education ', ' nutrition education ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Dermal ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Measurement ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' cooking ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Height ', ' 2 year college ', ' junior college ', ' two year college ', ' community college ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated fat ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Intake ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Update ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' informant ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' environmental intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' food environment ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' farmers markets ', ' recruit ', ' intervention participants ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carotenoids ', ' Carotenes and Carotenoids ', ' carotenoid biosynthesis ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Feedback ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Fingers ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Preferences ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Housing ', ' Hybrids ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Marketing ', ' Minority Groups ', ' ']",NCI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R37,2020,631005,0.14230308074101566
"Home Food Delivery for Diabetes Management in Patients of Rural Clinics ABSTRACT  Approximately 30 million (~9%) of all people in the US have type 2 diabetes (T2DM),1 and this number is expected to continue to rise.2 At the same time, 15 million (11.8%) US households experience food insecurity,3 defined as lack of access to adequate amounts of healthy food. T2DM and food insecurity are strongly related for U.S. adults: Very low food security is associated with an over 100% increase in T2DM prevalence compared with adults from high food-secure households.4 Residents of rural areas are particularly threatened by the intersection of food insecurity and T2DM. Food insecurity prevalence in rural areas is 1.2 times higher than in metropolitan areas.6 T2DM prevalence in rural areas is 17% higher than in metropolitan areas.7 Recent studies have shown promise for improving health indicators for food insecure people with T2DM. These studies have tested interventions distributing healthy food and shown preliminary indications of success for improving glycemic control, diabetes distress, self-reported diabetes management, and food security.22-24,29 We will test this approach for the first time in rural areas in a way that both promotes participant adherence and is scalable: we will employ home-delivery of T2DM-appropriate food boxes with evidence based-educational materials and recipes to improve glycemic control and diet quality of rural food insecure patients with T2DM. This intervention adopts a health equity framework:30,31 it addresses specific needs and barriers of rural food insecure households at risk for many health and economic disparities. Our long-term goal is to transform rural residents' management of T2DM.This study's objective is to determine the effectiveness of an intervention that is scalable and sustainable and promotes patient adherence by mitigating rural food insecure participants' difficulties associated with completing existing interventions. Our specific aims are: 1. Compare the effectiveness of the Healthy Food Delivery Intervention (HFDI) plus standard care and standard care alone to improve diabetes-related outcomes among rural food insecure patients with T2DM. 2. Compare the effectiveness of the HFDI plus standard care and standard care alone to improve diet quality among rural food insecure patients with T2DM. 3. Compare cost-effectiveness to understand HFDI plus standard care costs in relationship to outcomes in relation to standard care alone. We will conduct a fully-powered, comparative effectiveness RCT that includes 400 food insecure patients with T2DM. These patients will be recruited from clinics serving rural populations. Patients will be randomly assigned to either the HFDI plus standard care or standard care alone, with 200 in each arm. Baseline and follow up data (post-intervention, six months post- intervention, and 12 months post-intervention) will be collected from patients in both study arms. The Healthy Food Delivery intervention (HFDI) outcomes and findings will be applicable to vulnerable rural populations. This proposal directly addresses NIH funding priorities related to food insecurity.32 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Rural US residents are at high risk for food insecurity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM).6,7 Recent studies have shown promise for improving health indicators for food insecure people with T2DM by distributing healthy food,22-24,29 but these interventions have not been tested in the rural populations who may benefit from the interventions the most.

"The Influence of Quick-Service Restaurants on Children's Diets 7. Project Summary/Abstract Addressing childhood obesity remains one of the greatest public health priorities in the U.S., particularly among minority and lower socioeconomic status (SES) populations where the prevalence of obesity is highest. Studies have found a positive association between quick-service restaurant (QSR) food consumption and body mass index (BMI) among children. This is likely due in part to the high caloric content of foods from QSRs, especially the traditional side dishes and beverages (i.e. fried potato products and sugar-sweetened beverages) which can provide up to 350 additional calories per children’s meal compared with the healthier options available. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence the selection of healthier or less healthy children’s meal side dishes and beverages can have important implications for addressing obesity and health disparities. The proposed research will examine QSR environments (both the physical environment and verbal prompts), as well as parent-child interactions, that promote or discourage the selection of healthier children’s meal side dishes/ beverages. Additionally, we will analyze the impact of healthier side dish/beverage selection on overall meal consumption. Environmental assessments will occur in 136 QSRs in socioeconomically and ethnically diverse communities. Interactions when ordering will be observed among 64 parent-child pairs, and overall meal consumption will be assessed using plate waste methodology among 850 children. Expanding upon Dr. Cohen’s prior nutrition and plate waste research in low-income school districts, this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide additional training in behavior change techniques, qualitative data collection, analyses involving mixed-methods, behavioral/ family-centered theories, and conducting research to address health disparities. Dr. Cohen has the full support of The School of Science and Engineering at Merrimack College, as well as her exceptional, multidisciplinary team of mentors, who are committed to helping Dr. Cohen successfully complete the proposed training and research and become a successful independent researcher. Study results will be used to inform future intervention studies involving both QSRs and families to improve children’s selection/consumption of healthier QSR foods. This award will provide Dr. Cohen with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator conducting cross- disciplinary research that uses behavior change techniques and is informed by studying both environmental influences and the role of parents (applying qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research) to improve the diets of underserved children and reduced their risk of obesity. 8. Project Narrative Children frequently consume foods from quick-service restaurants, which are associated with increased risk of overweight; therefore research is needed to better understand how to improve food selections in this environment. This study will examine the influence of quick-service restaurant environments, as well as parent-child interactions in the restaurants, on children’s side dish and beverage selection and meal consumption. This research will provide an important foundation towards addressing childhood obesity and health disparities, and will improve the diets children in quick-service restaurants.",The Influence of Quick-Service Restaurants on Children's Diets,10007786,K01DK107810,"['Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Energy-Generating Resources ', ' energy source ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Selections ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' parent child interaction ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' Parents ', ' Potato ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Work ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Visual ', ' wasting ', ' sugar ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Calories ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' behavior change ', ' Physical environment ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated fat ', ' Employee ', ' Nutrient ', ' skills ', ' parent role ', ' parental role ', ' parent influence ', ' parental influence ', ' theories ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' child adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obese children ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' Food Energy ', ' food consumption ', ' obesity prevention ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' obesity risk ', ' parental involvement ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health priorities ', ' school district ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' Award ', ' Beverages ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' ']",NIDDK,MERRIMACK COLLEGE,K01,2020,126764,0.19343240252340535
"Effectiveness and Implementation of a Research Tested Mobile Produce Market Designed to Improve Diet in Underserved Communities Abstract This administrative supplement will support the development of Rosaura Romero's research and professional skills and provide her with mentoring for graduate school. We are not proposing any changes to the scope or human subjects of the parent grant and the abstract remains as follows: Lower-income and minority groups face significant health disparities with respect to obesity, cancer, heart disease and other diet-related chronic conditions.

"Ultra-Processed Foods and Childhood Obesity PROJECT SUMMARY Despite a broad understanding of the multi-level determinants of health disparities in childhood obesity, known risk factors including diet and physical often do not adequately predict later obesity among low-income and minority children. Developing effective intervention targets for childhood obesity in these populations is therefore difficult. Emerging evidence suggests that ultra-processed food consumption may partially explain health disparities in cardiovascular disease and cancer among adults. However, existing methods to classify foods based on the extent of processing are inconsistent and unclear, making it difficult to assess exposure to ultra-processed foods and associations with childhood weight outcomes. The current proposal will apply the NOVA classification for ultra-processed foods to dietary recall data from an NHLBI-funded childhood obesity prevention randomized controlled trial. Developing a reliable and valid methodology for assessing ultra- processed food consumption and testing associations with childhood obesity will generate evidence to better characterize dietary intake and to identify potential targets for reducing health disparities in childhood obesity. This proposal builds on a robust dataset from the Growing Right Onto Wellness (GROW) trial, which aimed to prevent childhood obesity using a three-year multi-level and culturally-tailored intervention. The trial randomized 610 parent-preschool child pairs and achieved >90% retention at three-year follow-up, with high rates of data completeness. Eligible children were ages 3-5 at enrollment, spoke English or Spanish, and had BMI ≥50th percentile and <95th percentile. The dataset includes 24-hour diet recall data collected using NDS-R software at baseline and three annual follow-up timepoints. The current proposal will develop and validate a novel coding algorithm to map the existing NOVA classification system for ultra-processed foods onto this diet recall data. This algorithm will generate an analytic variable that describes the number of calories consumed per day in each of the four NOVA classifications for food processing level. Using the newly developed approach to assessing ultra-processed food consumption, we will test the association between higher levels of ultra-processed foods and childhood obesity across 3 years of follow up. The main exposure variable will be the number of daily calories consumed for ultra-processed foods and the primary outcome will be child raw BMI. The goals of this proposal are to 1) advance dietary measurement by developing a novel methodology for evaluating levels of ultra-processed food consumption using diet recall data; 2) assess whether ultra-processed food consumption level is predictive of incident obesity among low- income, minority preschoolers; and 3) develop evidence for intervention targets for future R01 funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ultra-processed foods have poor nutritional quality, and the excess consumption of ultra-processed foods may partially explain health disparities in early childhood obesity. This proposal will develop a novel methodology for assessing the average daily intake of ultra-processed foods in a population of low-income and minority preschool-aged children. We will also test the association between ultra-processed food consumption and childhood growth patterns, with the goal of developing novel intervention targets for childhood obesity prevention and treatment.",Ultra-Processed Foods and Childhood Obesity,10063710,R03HL154243,"['Acceleration ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Preschool Child ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Family ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Processing ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Parents ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Cohort Analyses ', ' Cohort Analysis ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Height ', ' interest ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' nutritional epidemiology ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' child adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obese children ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' food consumption ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity prevention ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' Nonobese ', ' Non obese ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' obesity risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' nutritional guideline ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' minority children ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' secondary analysis ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2020,86500,0.2679552334692921
"Community Violence and its Impact on Food Retail, Food Purchasing Behavior, and Dietary Intake among Low-income African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Community violence is a major public health concern in the U.S. that disproportionately affects communities with predominately low-income and African American residents. Previous research has linked violent crime (i.e., murder, rape, aggravated assault, and armed robbery) at the community level to a variety of adverse health behaviors and health outcomes including substance abuse, mental illness, and physical inactivity. To date, very little research has been conducted on the nutritional consequences of community violence at the community or individual levels. As a result, there is limited understanding of how community violence affects the retail food environment and the diet-related behaviors of individuals and families. This K01 project seeks to fill this void in knowledge by examining community violence and its influence on food retail, food purchasing behavior, and dietary intake in low-income African American communities located in Chicago, IL. A mixed-methods research approach will be utilized to accomplish the following three research aims: 1) assess perceptions of how community violence has affected the business of local food retailers by conducting a series of semi-structured in-depth interviews with owners & managers of food retail businesses located in low-income African American communities in Chicago with a high violent crime rate, 2) evaluate longitudinal associations between community- level racial and socioeconomic characteristics, violent crime rates, and the availability and density of food retailers by analyzing 10 years of data collected by the City of Chicago (2008-2018), and 3) examine associations between exposure to community violence, food purchasing behavior, and dietary intake by surveying low-income African American adults who reside in a predominately low-income African American community in Chicago with a high violent crime rate. This research will greatly increase our understanding of how violence affects community nutrition. Furthermore, it will provide valuable information to researchers, policymakers, and public health agencies on the role of community violence in creating nutrition-related health inequities at the community and individual levels.

"Mobile Technology for Primary Care to Address Food Insecurity and Improve Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Food insecurity, the lack of consistent access to enough food for an active and healthy life, is an important social determinant of health that affects over 40 million Americans. Food insecurity is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Because of the prevalence and potential for poor health outcomes, national and state organizations recommend that health systems address food insecurity in order to improve patient care and reduce health disparities. Few clinicians assess patient’s food security in practice, though, and the pathways by which food insecurity leads to disparities in cardiovascular disease remain unclear. The research goals of this study are to advance our knowledge of the relationship between food insecurity and cardiovascular disease and test an innovative tablet-based application for primary care practices to address food insecurity in order to improve cardiovascular health. To accomplish these goals, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodical training with an innovative research agenda. Aim 1 will use national survey data to determine the pathways through which food insecurity is associated with cardiovascular disease using structural equation modeling. Aim 2 will engage patients, clinicians, clinic staff, and key community leaders in a highly iterative process of user- centered design to modify and tailor a tablet-based application for primary care practices to address the pathways identified in Aim 1. Aim 3 will determine the feasibility and potential impact of the tablet-based app in a pilot, pragmatic trial in one primary care practice. To successfully accomplish these Specific Aims, the PI will capitalize on the outstanding research environment at Wake Forest School of Medicine and an engaged interdisciplinary mentorship team (Drs. Rosenthal, Bertoni, Ip, Miller and Vitolins) of exceptionally qualified senior scientists. With guidance from his expert mentor team and through didactic coursework and hands-on experience, the PI will obtain the necessary training in structural equation modeling, cardiovascular epidemiology, clinical informatics, and pragmatic clinical trials to become an independent investigator and leader in reducing disparities in cardiovascular disease by addressing the social determinants of health. This proposed K23 award complements National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes’ strategic focus on investigating factors that account for differences in health among populations and optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award will advance our understanding of the chronic health effects of food insecurity and will be a timely catalyst for the PI in achieving his long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator focused on improving the health of low-income and vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Food insecurity is a major public health problem that affects 1 in 7 Americans, disproportionately impacts low- income and minority households, and is associated with poor cardiovascular health. The proposed Mentored Career Development Award will provide further understanding of the relationship between food insecurity and cardiovascular disease allowing us to tailor an innovative tool for primary care practices to address food insecurity and improve cardiovascular health.

"Understanding & Overcoming Food Insecurity in Diabetes Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Food insecurity, defined as difficulty affording an adequate diet owing to cost, affects over 20% of the 29 million Americans with diabetes. Food insecurity is an important socioeconomic barrier to effective diabetes care: it is associated with worse diabetes control and increased emergency department visits and hospitalization. By incentivizing consumption of calorie-dense foods high in simple carbohydrates and saturated fats, instead of more expensive fresh produce and whole grains, food insecurity may undermine healthy diets that are crucial for diabetes management. This project will help advance our knowledge of the relationship between food insecurity and diabetes by identifying how food insecurity affects current diabetes management and examining the clinical effects of using different strategies to overcome it. Fundamental questions regarding the mechanisms underlying potential interventions remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To determine the impact of food insecurity on a lifestyle change intervention: the REAL HEALTH Diabetes trial (R18 DK102737 NCT02320253), a pragmatic adaptation of the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention to community health centers, 2)To estimate the effect of nutrition assistance program use on diabetes control for patients in a primary care network, and 3) To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility of home-delivered medically tailored meals for food insecure diabetes patients with hyperglycemia. This research program complements the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' strategic focus on translating clinical research to practice by overcoming barriers faced by patients in real-world settings, reducing disparities in special populations, making care more patient-centered, and innovating within systems of care. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in understanding how socioeconomic barriers affect diabetes management and pragmatic interventions to overcome them. Career development activities include training in advanced analytic methods and intervention design through formal coursework as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will fill important knowledge gaps, and help improve diabetes management and reduce diabetes complications in patients with food insecurity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Over 29 million Americans have diabetes, and 1 in 5, nearly 6 million, report food insecurity, or difficulty accessing nutritious food owing to cost. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of the role food insecurity plays in diabetes management, and assess 2 strategies to address food insecurity in diabetes patients: 1) improving food access using nutritional assistance programs, and 2) directly providing medically tailored meals. This program has the potential to expand partnerships between healthcare systems and community organizations, and may reduce the impact of food insecurity among vulnerable diabetes patients",Understanding & Overcoming Food Insecurity in Diabetes Patients,9931223,K23DK109200,"['Affect ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' whole grain ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Housing ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Incentives ', ' indexing ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Program Development ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Work ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' diet supplement ', ' nutritional supplement ', ' dietary supplements ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Calories ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' SNAP ', ' S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine ', ' American ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated fat ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Improve Access ', ' International ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' Food Access ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical effect ', ' community organizations ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' research into practice ', ' research to practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' diabetes control ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' delivered meals ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' health care community ', ' healthcare community ', ' diet adherence ', ' dietary adherence ', ' food insecurity ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K23,2020,194820,0.30886206818434964
"A large-scale, long-term, randomized trial of nutrition labeling interventions PROJECT SUMMARY Poor dietary habits are associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. Government and institutional policy makers worldwide are interested in food labeling and messaging as a cost-effective strategy to encourage healthier food choices. Although there is evidence that nutrition labels can influence behavior, it is unclear which label designs are most effective at altering behavior for people with different levels of education. There are three common types of nutrition labels: a single logo highlighting healthier choices, traffic light labels, or physical activity labels that translate calorie information into exercise required to burn off the calories. Because there have been no large-scale, long-term randomized trials comparing the effect of these labels on behavior, the relative impact of these labeling schemes is unknown. Such rigorous evaluations are needed so policy makers do not have to guess. The overall objective of this application is to compare four theoretically-informed nutrition label designs in the first long-term, large-scale randomized trial of nutrition messages. The study will be conducted in partnership with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health which will enable us to randomize 267 (107 snack and 160 beverage) vending machines to different nutrition label messages. Beverage machines will be randomized to one of the following four conditions: 1) A single green traffic light label next to items meeting a “healthy” threshold; 2) a multiple traffic light label that displays red, yellow, or green labels to indicate options that range from less to more healthy; 3) a physical activity label that indicates the number of minutes one would have to walk to burn off the calories in each food or beverage; or 4) tax-related messaging (Philadelphia implemented a 1.5 cents per ounce beverage tax in January 2017). Snack machines will be randomized to the same conditions except for the tax messaging, which does not apply to foods. We will use vending machine transaction data over three years to compare the influence each label has on average calories and percentage of healthy and less healthy items purchased as well as impact on sales. We will also conduct interviews with 2,916 vending machine patrons to evaluate whether education level and other factors moderate message influence. This study will provide valuable data to fill research gaps and inform policy makers’ efforts to use nutrition labeling and messaging as a public health approach to encourage healthier choices and address health disparities. !

"The Monthly Cycling of Food Insecurity and Diabetes Risk PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for an R21 award for Dr. Bermúdez-Millán, a Public Health Nutritionist and junior faculty at the Department of Community Health and Health Care, School of Medicine at the University of Connecticut Health Center. As compared with non-Latino White women, Latino women are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. A novel putative risk factor for the development of diabetes that disproportionately affects Latinas is food insecurity, and more specifically, the monthly cycling of food insecurity. Food insecurity has been linked to obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease although the mechanisms are not well elucidated. The proposed research narrows in, specifically, the monthly cycling of food insecurity and its associations with dietary intake/quality, eating disturbance, mental distress and diabetes risk markers. The research plan involves conducting a formative pilot study among 100 food insecure Latinas of childbearing age, to investigate the influence of food insecurity on diabetes risk. Since food insecurity is a long term and episodic experience, our overall hypothesis is that, compared to weeks of food adequacy (food security), weeks of food inadequacy (food insecurity) will be characterized by worsened near-term diabetes risk markers, i.e., fasting glucose, insulin resistance, fructosamine, and glycated albumin and higher long-term metabolic risk markers, i.e. HbA1c, waist circumference, and body mass index. We are also planning to determine if diet, eating disturbance, and psychological distress mediate the relationship between food insecurity and diabetes risk. We hypothesize that, compared to weeks of food adequacy (food security), weeks of food inadequacy (food insecurity) (1) will be characterized by eating disturbance (emotional eating and binge-eating); poorer diet quality (Fat/Sugar/Fruit/Vegetable Screener); and increased psychological distress (depression and anxiety symptoms). Using a repeated measure design, we will collect data at timepoints that will allow us to model mediation effects. Finally, we will develop and collect household food inventory data using an app for smart phones, where subjects can enter foods left in their pantry and refrigerator weekly, as well as uploading photographs. Following completion of the quantitative study, we will conduct 15 in-depth interviews with women having the worse glycemic control, to identify barriers and facilitators to improve Fat/Sugar/Fruit/Vegetable intake among food insecure Latinas using the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) framework, and inform the design of a larger study for an intervention application. Eventually this line of research will lead to novel interventions and inform policy to decrease the deleterious effects of food insecurity on risk for type 2 diabetes. My established relationships with community agencies in the Latino community make this project highly feasible. 1 Project Narrative The study proposed here will examine a serious limitation in the literature, the impact of food insecurity as it unfolds over the course of the month. It will demonstrate that as household food insecurity increases, dietary quality, emotional eating, binge-eating and mental distress worsens and diabetes markers deteriorate. Findings can also have major intervention and policy implications, such as behavioral interventions, which might include support for emotional distress and implementing food resource management

"Impact of Navajo Nation Tax on Junk Food 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  2 The Navajo Epidemiology Center manages Navajo public health information systems, and  3 provides data and reports that inform health programming for the over 330,000 enrolled  4 members of the Navajo tribe. Their reports have documented high prevalence of diabetes  5 and obesity, limited availability of healthy traditional foods, and high rates of consumption of  6 sugar sweetened beverages. To address these issues and its consequences, the Navajo  7 Nation passed the Healthy Diné Nation Act (HDNA) in November 2014. The law includes a  8 2% tax on foods of little-to-no-nutritional value (‘junk foods’), the first-ever such tax in the  9 United States. Revenues from the tax are distributed annually to each of the 110 local 10 government entities (chapters) to develop and support local wellness projects. The law was 11 passed with the expectation that the increased cost would impact the food environment, lead 12 to reduced consumption of junk foods and provide a sustainable source of funds to support 13 local needs for wellness programming. 14 To date, however, a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the tax has not been 15 completed. Therefore, the research team, consisting of the Navajo Epidemiology Center, 16 Northern Arizona University and Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital local community 17 affiliate propose to study the impact of the tax on 3 major components: 1) chapter wellness 18 programming supported by tax revenue, 2) changes in the food store environment and 19 pricing following the tax implementation; and 3) changes in sugar sweetened beverage and 20 fruit/vegetable intake following the tax implementation. Chapter wellness programming will be 21 assessed via data from the Division of Community Development, who are supportive of the 22 project. Changes in the food store environment will be assessed via a follow-up of a 2013 23 (pre-tax) survey of 83 stores across the Navajo Nation, which will also identify positive 24 outliers in terms of changes in healthy food offerings. Consumption behaviors will be 25 assessed by conducting a follow-up of the unique Navajo BRFSS, which is a population wide 26 survey following rigorous BRFSS methods. The team has active Navajo IRB protocols to 27 support each aim, and have collaborative support from key stakeholders, positioning us well 28 to deliver on the proposed aims. It is our belief that information from this study is timely, 29 urgent and will be essential for the Navajo Nation leadership to make an informed decision 30 about the continuation of the junk food tax. Project Narrative To address substantial health disparities among the Navajo people, the Navajo Nation passed the 2014 Healthy Diné Nation Act (HDNA), which includes a 2% tax on junk foods. This proposal aims to assess the impact of the junk food tax by utilizing several high quality and culturally specific data sources developed by the Navajo Epidemiology Center. Specifically, we will summarize chapter wellness programming supported by tax revenue, assess changes in the food store environment and behaviors including consumption of sugar- sweetened beverages, fruit and vegetables.",Impact of Navajo Nation Tax on Junk Food,10257764,R01MD013352,"['Arizona ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Government ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Hospitals ', ' Laws ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Methods ', ' Local Government ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Taxation ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' sugar ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Navaho ', ' Navajo ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' authority ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Health Information System ', ' member ', ' Funding Source ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' BRFSS ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Intake ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' cost ', ' consumer demand ', ' tribal Nation ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' food environment ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' Diné ', ' Diné Nation ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,87714,0.26684733529078203
"Mobile Health App to Reduce Diabetes in Latina Women with Prior Gestational Diabetes Abstract  Latino communities have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, being both at increased risk and experiencing more severe illness when infected. Latinos living in Puerto Rico have also been affected via access to healthy food. Even before the pandemic, access to healthy food had been threatened due to the unprecedented series of natural disasters, including Hurricane Maria in 2017. The onset of COVID-19 has further threatened access to healthy food. Relatedly, social distancing rules, which limit access to beaches, parks and public recreation areas to prevent unhealthy crowding in these spaces, may have a greater negative impact on low-income Puerto Ricans who rely on these spaces for physical activity. While public health recommendations for healthy shopping, healthy eating, and physical exercise during COVID-19 have emerged, these recommendations have not targeted to Latinos nor are they available in Spanish. Puerto Ricans would benefit from targeted healthy shopping and eating guidance due to the widespread food insecurity and poverty that already existed prior to COVID-19, and physical activity guidance due to the COVID-19 related constraints to outdoor physical activity.  Digital technology, which is widely used by Puerto Rico residents, is a way to help families engage in healthy behaviors in the face of COVID-19, as it overcomes barriers by providing behavioral tools on healthy food shopping and food preparation, and providing ways to increase physical activity. Tailoring this information to Latinas, who typically manage shopping and food preparation in Latino families, would increase its impact. To our knowledge, no digital health intervention has been specifically targeted to, and co-designed with Latinas to promote healthy food shopping, healthy eating, and physical activity during COVID-19. While such an intervention has potential value for many Latino subgroups, Puerto Ricans represent a high-priority target because of pre-existing vulnerabilities brought about by several natural disasters that preceded COVID-19.  The overall goal of this competitive supplement is to develop a culturally- and individually-tailored Spanish/ English digital health intervention to promote healthy food shopping and healthy eating, as well as physical activity, among Puerto Rican Latinas during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. This competitive revision expands the scope of our current SBIR Phase II parent grant (Hola Bebé), which is building and testing a digital health intervention with tools for healthy eating and physical activity for Latinas with a prior history of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), as well as builds on our SBIR Phase I project (LISTA), which developed tools for healthy shopping and eating for Latinas. We are committed to the rapid dissemination of the mobile app during the pandemic and its aftermath, to Latina users of community health centers throughout Puerto Rico, as well as other sites where Latinas access food. Narrative The proposed supplement seeks to develop and test the short-term effectiveness of a digital health intervention targeted to, and co-designed with Latinas living in Puerto Rico in order to promote healthy food shopping, healthy eating, and physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. While such an intervention has potential value for many Latino subgroups, Puerto Ricans living on the Island represent an especially high-priority target because of pre-existing vulnerabilities to accessing healthy food that emerged after Hurricane Maria in 2017. We are committed to the rapid dissemination of the mobile app, which will include substantial culturally tailored information from many sources, including the USDA's MyPlate, that will provide Latinas with the behavioral tools to support healthy shopping, eating, and physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.",Mobile Health App to Reduce Diabetes in Latina Women with Prior Gestational Diabetes,10193260,R44MD009454,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Housing ', ' Hurricane ', ' Island ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recreation ', ' Risk ', ' Social Distance ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Gestational Diabetes ', ' Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes ', ' pregnancy diabetes ', ' Latino ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' tool ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' food preparation ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' diabetes risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Subgroup ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Food Access ', ' parent grant ', ' primary outcome ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' social media ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' Android ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' farmers markets ', ' Mobile Health App ', ' m-Health app ', ' m-Health application ', ' mHealth app ', ' mHealth application ', ' Mobile Health Application ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' WIC ', ' WIC program ', ' Women, Infants and Children (WIC) ', ' Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ', ' food insecurity ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' ']",NIMHD,"ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH GROUP, INC.",R44,2020,172705,0.12730727944611278
