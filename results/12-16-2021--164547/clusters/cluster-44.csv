"Health Literacy: A Guide for Health Professionals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low literacy, poor health and early death are strongly linked in this country and around the world. With approximately 50% of the American public reading at or below the 8th grade level, and the population becoming evermore diverse linguistically and culturally, communicating healthcare and health system information effectively have become complex public health issues. Most health information in print and on the web is written at 10th grade reading level and much higher. The growing complexity of medicine and health care as well as the changing demographics of the country has resulted in poor health literacy among many vulnerable populations including undereducated, low income, ethnic minorities and the elderly. The consequences of low health literacy include inadequate skills to understand and use health care, poor health outcomes, lack of social empowerment and self-efficacy and increased financial costs to the health care system. The Healthy People 2010 guidelines contain an initiative that acknowledges the importance of addressing low health literacy to eliminate health disparities. We propose to research and write a manuscript that examines the critical role literacy plays in public health. The goal of the manuscript will be to make a compelling argument for health literacy as a major public health issue and to demonstrate solutions. We will place the discussion of health literacy in an historical context and present relevant communication models in order to analyze case examples of health communications and then construct easy to understand best practice guidelines for writing and designing linguistically and culturally appropriate health information. The mediums we will predominantly focus on are print communications and the World Wide Web. The target population for this manuscript will be health professionals including public health officials, health communicators and health educators as well as writers and designers working with them.

"CCMC Parting Shots: Extending Access to Health Informat*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Abstract : Christ Community Medical Clinic is a faith-based, not-for-profit health-care organization that  provides primary medical, dental, and obstetrical care to two of the most disadvantaged sections of  Memphis, Tennessee. In order to extend access to high-quality online health information for poor and low-literacy patients, the CCMC Parting Shots project proposes to create a clinical process to provide its patients with individualized health information printed from selected websites before the patients leave the clinic. By promptly and efficiently providing access to information that is accurate, current, and appropriate to the patients' literacy, CCMC intends to give its low-income and minority patients better opportunities to understand and manage their own health, thus reducing health disparities in these Memphis communities.      The specific aims of the project are 1) to select low-literacy web-based patient education materials and  organize them for quick location by linking them to an index web page for the clinic nursing staff; and 2) to integrate finding, printing, and giving ""parting shots"" copies of the selected web materials into the consistent routine used by the nursing staff to conclude a clinic visit.      In order to accomplish these aims, grant funds will be expended to assess current patient education  materials and routines in the light of the functional health literacy of CCMC patients; to support monthly  meetings of a task force reviewing and selecting Internet resources for literacy level, medical accuracy, and currency; to design, develop, and implement the web index page; to purchase and install printers; to train clinic nursing staff; to print the handouts; and to evaluate whether the project's goals are being  accomplished. The results of this project will be disseminated to peers to show the value of integrating health information provided online by the National Library of Medicine and other high-quality health information providers into the community-based health-care setting and to encourage the use of high quality online information by health professionals and the public.      We hope thereby to become a clinical model of excellent and appropriate patient communication.

"JUSTA: Justice and Health for Poultry Workers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The overall goal of this project is to address the health disparities faced by immigrant Latino poultry workers in rural, western North Carolina (NC), through a partnership (JUSTA-Justice and Health for Poultry Workers) of community advocates, environmental health sciences, and health care providers.  Workers in the poultry industry in the U.S. experience a disproportionate share of occupation-attributed musculoskeletal, skin and respiratory disorders.  Recent trends in this industry have concentrated the injuries in a worker population that is poor, minority, and comprised predominantly of immigrants.  These workers are purposively recruited into jobs rejected by the local population, and lack the means to protect themselves from hazards.  The exposures of workers also affect their families.  To bring about greater social and environmental justice for these workers, the proposed work will have two loci:  helping individual workers and their families to be more resilient to stressors, strengthening community-based organizations so that they can move toward social and regulatory change and justice.  Community advocates, health care providers and environmental health researchers will work together in this project to address five Specific Aims:  1) to encourage social action by Latino community-based advocacy groups in western NC to effect policies that reduce the burden of occupational and environmental health disparities due to employment in the poultry industry; 2) to construct the foundation on which to base educational materials and communication strategies designed to prevent or reduce exposure to physical and social occupational stressors and their effects among Latino poultry worker families; 3) to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate educational materials and implement programs that will promote ways to prevent or reduce exposure to physical and social occupational stressors and their effects among Latino poultry worker families; 4) to develop educational materials and implement programs that will better prepare health care providers to recognize and treat with cultural competence illnesses related to poultry production and processing among immigrant families, and counsel families on ways to prevent or reduce exposure; and 5) to evaluate the process and outcomes of community participation in this project so that it can be used by other community-based organizations to engage community residents in efforts to reduce environmental and occupational risks in their own communities.

"Physical Activity, Learning Styles and Health Literacy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge facing the health community is the increasing rates of physical inactivity. This is of significant concern as more studies are documenting the relationship between physical inactivity and obesity, poor quality of life and health status. Since most adults spend the majority of their waking hours at work, the workplace environment is a promising area for physical activity interventions. A number of studies have documented the effectiveness of various programs, while many others have shown they are not effective. One avenue that has not been explored is the role of employee's learning styles and health literacy skills with various physical activity interventions. Perhaps if an employee's style is matched with an appropriate intervention method, they would be more likely to change their behavior. The overall project goal is to determine the effectiveness of a tailored innovative worksite health promotion program to increase physical activity. Specifically, the project's objectives are to: 1) enhance current health promotion activities for Emory employees; 2) determine if employee's choice of different intervention strategies vary by learning styles and health literacy skills; 3) evaluate the effectiveness of tailoring intervention programs based on learning styles and health literacy skills of the target population; and 4) examine the cost effectiveness of different components of the intervention program.  The randomized control trial will involve over 1,600 Emory employees, including Emory University, Emory Healthcare and Emory Clinic and will build upon current efforts to improve the health of Emory employees. The trans-disciplinary and trans-sector project team consists of established researchers at Emory School of Public Health, key staff with various business units at Emory (Human Resources, Faculty and Staff Assistance Program, Healthcare), Emory employees representing a range of occupations (e.g., custodial, faculty), and an advisory panel of nationally renowned public health and learning theory professionals.

"Surveillance of Mortality and Morbidity in US Workers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Race-ethinicity and socio-economic status health disparities in occupational health have not been extensively investigated. Although significantly under-reported, occupational disease and injury, and mortality represent a significant health impact on US workers and their families. However, the risks for this occupational mortality and morbidity are not evenly distributed. It appears that these risks disproportionately affect US workers from race-ethnicity subpopulations and from lower socio-economic class. The University of Miami NIOSH NHIS Research Group proposes to use their existing Study Database derived from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), augmented by newly released NHIS data, to explore issues of health disparities among US workers based on differences between race-ethnic and socioeconomic classes. The augmented NHIS database of a representative sample of over 660,000 US workers will allow the exploration of morbidity and mortality differences between and within occupations by various race ethnic subpopulations and by socio-economic class. Based on their previous work, the Investigators propose to pursue more sophisticated theoretical models to evaluate pathways of occupational risk, and morbidity and mortality between and within occupational subgroups. The use of these models will allow the Investigators to assess the relationship between occupation, indicators of morbidity, and the risk of mortality, testing whether or not the mortality risks noted in worker subgroups are mediated by morbidity. In addition, the Investigators propose to use the new NHIS data and the additional statistical modeling to explore the issue of health disparities among US workers based on different socio-economic and race-ethnicity subpopulations. Finally, the Investigators propose to produce an additional interactive Monograph on Health Disparities and Occupation in US Workers that will be made available through the expanded Study Website (www.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/niehs/niosh/). This study proposal satisfies at least 3 NIOSH research priority areas (NORA): Surveillance research methods with unique mortality and morbidity data on 1) the entire US workforce; 2) older, race-ethnic, lower socio-economic and gender-specific worker subpopulations; and 3) social and economic costs of workplace disease and injury.

"Boundary Crossings: Re-Situating Cultural Competence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This 4 year longitudinal, urban, multi-method ethnographic study will examine cross cultural healthcare encounters. The study will identify, describe and situate how families contribute to the production of culturally responsive care and the strategies families and practitioners employ to establish commonality, bridge difference, and effectively ""partner up."" This is a continuation of Boundary Crossing: A Longitudinal and Ethnographic Study (R01 HD 38878, 2000-2004). It builds upon research conducted with a cohort of African American children with special health care needs, their primary caregivers, extended family networks, and the practitioners who serve them. Although there is an overwhelming body of literature confirming health care disparities for ethnic minorities, there is a striking paucity of strategies to address this significant public health issue. Much research on cultural competence radically underestimates how much work families do to achieve culturally competent care. Longitudinal and learning aspects are under-described, as are their strengths and resources families bring to healthcare encounters. The proposed research is both events centered and longitudinal. We will examine how discrete moments of healthcare encounters produce effects across both contexts and time, influencing developmental trajectories, family life, and health and therapeutic outcomes. The anticipated outcomes of this project are a description and interpretation of: 1) the knowledge and strategies families bring to shape encounters and generate desirable outcomes; 2) how families and practitioners revise their strategies; 3) how practitioners, family, and children develop and draw upon their history of shared endeavors; 4) how practitioners shape intervention to the unique needs and strengths of family and child; 5) how families and practitioners challenge and attempt to disconfirm stereotypes; and 6) the cultural resources practitioners and families draw upon. Findings that will result from this study will facilitate a reconsideration of dominant models of cultural competence and health literacy at multiple policy levels.

"Literacy and Mortality Among Elderly Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low literacy is highly prevalent in the United States. According to the U.S. Department of Education's National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS) of 1992, 21 percent of adults possess skills in the lowest level of prose, document, and quantitative literacy. Another 27 percent of adults fall under the second lowest level of literacy proficiency and may be hindered in routine daily activities. The prevalence of low literacy increases dramatically with age: 44 percent of U.S. adults age 65 and older had level 1 reading skills on the NALS. Individuals with inadequate literacy have worse health in cross sectional studies and higher hospitalization rates in prospective studies. No previous study has examined whether literacy independently predicts death. In addition, the mechanisms by which literacy affects health outcomes remain unclear. The primary aims of this study are: 1) To determine whether elderly persons with inadequate or marginal functional health literacy have higher mortality than persons with adequate literacy after adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and   baseline health and chronic conditions, and 2) To determine the importance of different causal pathways between literacy and mortality and the residual effect of literacy on mortality after adjusting for all pathways examined, including a) adverse health behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, obesity, and seat belt use), b) under use of preventive services (mammography, Papanicolau smear, and pneumococcal and influenza vaccination), c) occupation and income, and d) lower levels of social support. Data from a cohort of 3260 community dwelling elderly who completed a one hour in-home interview that measured health behaviors, health care use, physical and mental health, functional health literacy (Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults) and cognitive functioning (Mini Mental Status Examination) will be linked to the National Death Index to track mortality. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to determine the independent association between literacy and mortality. The pathways described above will be sequentially added to the models to determine the change in the beta coefficients for literacy to determine the degree to which each pathway mediates the relationship between literacy and mortality.            ",Literacy and Mortality Among Elderly Persons,6959718,R01AG026393,"['human old age (65+) ', ' aging ', ' health ', ' health care service utilization ', ' interview ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' mental health ', ' psychological model ', ' human mortality ', ' health behavior ', ' cognition ', ' memory ', ' academic achievement ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' psychological aspect of aging ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2005,126225,0.1925611172637402

The model training will consist of courses that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120, address environmental justice and health disparities, and assist worker-trainer development and evaluation.  Specific Aims include to, 1) expand model site-based training, called ITS programs, to meld 1910.120-based training into broad, ongoing plant-wide prevention programs. The TMC will add 8 ITS programs per year (total of 40 new sites) to our existing 35 sites resulting in 72 total sites at the end of five years involving an estimated 30,000 workers and managers.  In addition, the goals are to, 2) pilot a new Near-miss Initiative working with the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center of the University of Pennsylvania; 3) conduct community/labor workshops with regional environmental justice networks and Latino workers; 4) expand the use of advanced training technologies including web-based lessons learned, e-learning and emergency response simulation programs; 5) use participatory research and evaluation to monitor and strengthen the program; and 6) lead a multi-grantee (seven unions) initiative to work together on trainer, curriculum and evaluation development.  With the HDPTP supplement the TMC will help protect workers and community residents from potential exposures to hazardous materials released during terrorist attacks on industrial facilities with large volumes of highly hazardous chemicals, specifically at the 306 Risk Management Program Sites (RMPs) at which PACE and USWA represent 75,000 workers.  The TMC will reach 19,700 participants with 192,360 contact hours of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) prevention, preparedness and response training.

"Refining and Standardizing Health Literacy Assessment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Low literacy is associated with health disparities in access to health information, understanding of illness / treatment, health status, understanding and use of preventive services, and hospitalizations. Better understanding of patients' health literacy would allow for targeted interventions to reduce identified disparities. However, due to assessment burden, scoring imprecision, and inadequate English and Spanish language equivalence, available health literacy measures are not optimal for use in clinical practice or research. Aims: The aims of this application are 1) to develop English and Spanish language item banks for measuring reading-related health literacy skills; 2) to evaluate the feasibility, validity and acceptability of computer-based methods for comprehensive assessment of health literacy; 3) to develop and pilot computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of health literacy in clinical settings; and 4) to use a theory-driven framework to evaluate the associations between health literacy, patient characteristics, enabling resources, needs, health behaviors related to prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and health status. Methods: State-of-the-science analytical methods will be used to develop sets of health literacy questions (""item banks"") to support brief, targeted assessment using CAT. A validated bilingual multimedia ""Talking Touchscreen"" will be adapted to administer CAT to measure health literacy in English and Spanish primary care patients. A cross-sectional study will use this tool to evaluate the associations between patient characteristics, behaviors, outcomes and health literacy. Significance: This project will advance measurement technique through the development of a state-of-the-science computer adaptive tool that will allow precise and rapid measurement of health literacy, enhance ability to distinguish between language and literacy barriers, and increase understanding of associations between health literacy, health behaviors and health outcomes.

"Amelioration of Literacy Deficits in Prenatal Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The literacy challenges of the medical dialogue are considerable and significant; as these challenges fall within the relatively unexplored domains of conceptual and oral literacy, they have been all but ignored in the exponentially growing literacy literature. Nevertheless, it is in the oral and conceptual literacy domains that critical issues arise in face-to-face interactions with health providers. It is here that the frustration grows in the accomplishment of the most basic of patient goals- to understand and be understood. There is reason to believe that these challenges are especially evident for low-literate women seeking prenatal care. Despite evidence of persistent socioeconomic and racial disparity in prenatal, perinatal, and post-partum services utilization and health outcomes, there has been relatively little federal focus on setting goals for the amelioration of literacy and health communication deficits affecting pregnant and post-partum women and their babies (Healthy People 2010), or in designing literacy interventions to improve health outcomes for this population. It is in the first prenatal visit that significant cognitive and emotional challenges are likely to arise in the complex information needed to make an informed choice about prenatal testing and in facing the psychosocial and emotional challenges of pregnancy. Consequently, it is the first visit that is likely to set the stage forfeiture exchanges and determine the relationship that develops, and the array of attitudinal, psychological, behavioral, and health outcomes that derive from care. The specific aims of the study are: (1) To understand the relationships among print, conceptual and oral literacy dimensions and to investigate the communication characteristics of deficits in these realms; (2) To work collaboratively with low-literate women, and health literacy experts, to develop a communication intervention designed to: (a) ameliorate oral and conceptual literacy deficits related to informed choice regarding prenatal genetic testing and (b)to facilitate disclosure and discussion about sensitive emotional and psychosocial topics, and (3) to conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the effect of the intervention on a variety of outcomes including: interaction, understanding, satisfaction, prenatal care utilization, post-partum appointment keeping, antenatal and post-partum depression symptoms, and pre-term deliveries.

"Worker Health and Safety Training Cooperative Agreement    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)      The Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC) formed by The Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union (PACE), the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and the Labor Institute (together representing over 875,000 industrial workers) will conduct over the next 5 years approximately 3,800 workshops reaching 86,000 workers and community residents with 900,000 hours of training to prevent hazardous substance emergencies and to protect workers and communities should such accidents occur. The model training will consist of courses that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120, address environmental justice and health disparities, and assist worker-trainer development and evaluation.  Specific Aims include to, 1) expand model site-based training, called ITS programs, to meld 1910.120-based training into broad, ongoing plant-wide prevention programs. The TMC will add 8 ITS programs per year (total of 40 new sites) to our existing 35 sites resulting in 72 total sites at the end of five years involving an estimated 30,000 workers and managers.  In addition, the goals are to, 2) pilot a new Near-miss Initiative working with the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center of the University of Pennsylvania; 3) conduct community/labor workshops with regional environmental justice networks and Latino workers; 4) expand the use of advanced training technologies including web-based lessons learned, e-learning and emergency response simulation programs; 5) use participatory research and evaluation to monitor and strengthen the program; and 6) lead a multi-grantee (seven unions) initiative to work together on trainer, curriculum and evaluation development.  With the HDPTP supplement the TMC will help protect workers and community residents from potential exposures to hazardous materials released during terrorist attacks on industrial facilities with large volumes of highly hazardous chemicals, specifically at the 306 Risk Management Program Sites (RMPs) at which PACE and USWA represent 75,000 workers.  The TMC will reach 19,700 participants with 192,360 contact hours of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) prevention, preparedness and response training.  The TMC will also recruit and train an entirely new, nation-wide, industrial catastrophic incident Prevention, Preparedness and Response (PPR) Corps composed of 68 experienced workers from RMP sites. The PPR Corps, consisting of credentialed industrial responders, will work with OSHA, and through OSHA, the DHS to assist in OSHA's Regional Emergency Response Plans for high hazard sites. The PPR Corps will train industrial site workers, management and community responders, as well as conduct facility audits to evaluate prevention activities, emergency preparedness, and readiness to create site safety plans in the event of a catastrophe.         ",Worker Health and Safety Training Cooperative Agreement,7125185,U45ES006175,"['cooperative study ', ' curriculum ', ' training ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' waste disposal ', ' waste treatment ', ' industrial waste ', ' human subject ', ' occupational health /safety ', ' occupational hazard ', ' labor union ', ' hazardous substance ', ' ']",NIEHS,STEELWORKER CHARITABLE/EDUCATIONAL ORG,U45,2006,1872224,0.06355940784346867
"Physical Activity, Learning Styles and Health Literacy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge facing the health community is the increasing rates of physical inactivity. This is of significant concern as more studies are documenting the relationship between physical inactivity and obesity, poor quality of life and health status. Since most adults spend the majority of their waking hours at work, the workplace environment is a promising area for physical activity interventions. A number of studies have documented the effectiveness of various programs, while many others have shown they are not effective. One avenue that has not been explored is the role of employee's learning styles and health literacy skills with various physical activity interventions. Perhaps if an employee's style is matched with an appropriate intervention method, they would be more likely to change their behavior. The overall project goal is to determine the effectiveness of a tailored innovative worksite health promotion program to increase physical activity. Specifically, the project's objectives are to: 1) enhance current health promotion activities for Emory employees; 2) determine if employee's choice of different intervention strategies vary by learning styles and health literacy skills; 3) evaluate the effectiveness of tailoring intervention programs based on learning styles and health literacy skills of the target population; and 4) examine the cost effectiveness of different components of the intervention program.  The randomized control trial will involve over 1,600 Emory employees, including Emory University, Emory Healthcare and Emory Clinic and will build upon current efforts to improve the health of Emory employees. The trans-disciplinary and trans-sector project team consists of established researchers at Emory School of Public Health, key staff with various business units at Emory (Human Resources, Faculty and Staff Assistance Program, Healthcare), Emory employees representing a range of occupations (e.g., custodial, faculty), and an advisory panel of nationally renowned public health and learning theory professionals.

"Boundary Crossings: Re-Situating Cultural Competence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This 4 year longitudinal, urban, multi-method ethnographic study will examine cross cultural healthcare encounters. The study will identify, describe and situate how families contribute to the production of culturally responsive care and the strategies families and practitioners employ to establish commonality, bridge difference, and effectively ""partner up."" This is a continuation of Boundary Crossing: A Longitudinal and Ethnographic Study (R01 HD 38878, 2000-2004). It builds upon research conducted with a cohort of African American children with special health care needs, their primary caregivers, extended family networks, and the practitioners who serve them. Although there is an overwhelming body of literature confirming health care disparities for ethnic minorities, there is a striking paucity of strategies to address this significant public health issue. Much research on cultural competence radically underestimates how much work families do to achieve culturally competent care. Longitudinal and learning aspects are under-described, as are their strengths and resources families bring to healthcare encounters. The proposed research is both events centered and longitudinal. We will examine how discrete moments of healthcare encounters produce effects across both contexts and time, influencing developmental trajectories, family life, and health and therapeutic outcomes. The anticipated outcomes of this project are a description and interpretation of: 1) the knowledge and strategies families bring to shape encounters and generate desirable outcomes; 2) how families and practitioners revise their strategies; 3) how practitioners, family, and children develop and draw upon their history of shared endeavors; 4) how practitioners shape intervention to the unique needs and strengths of family and child; 5) how families and practitioners challenge and attempt to disconfirm stereotypes; and 6) the cultural resources practitioners and families draw upon. Findings that will result from this study will facilitate a reconsideration of dominant models of cultural competence and health literacy at multiple policy levels.

"HIV Prevention with Heroin Using Women Sex Workers in Tajikistan    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV/AIDS is rapidly increasing among injecting heroin users and sex workers in the Central Asian country of Tajikistan. The Tajikistan government and other stakeholders are concerned about the limited success of standard HIV prevention programs and recognize the need for targeted preventive interventions. In this US- Tajik collaborative study, we develop and pilot a woman-focused HIV preventive intervention for heroin using sex workers. The specific aims of the study are: 1) To examine how key adverse social environmental conditions in Tajikistan make heroin using women sex workers at higher risk of HIV and interfere with HIV risk behavior change efforts; and 2) To design and a woman-focused HIV preventive intervention for heroin using woman sex workers and to pilot the intervention to assess feasibility. The key adverse social environmental conditions identified through the pilot research are addiction, poverty, gender inequality and violence against women, and lack of services. The conceptual framework of this study emphasizes the impact of social environment conditions on risk reduction. To inform intervention development, we will use ethnographic methods to interview 30 heroin using woman sex workers and to conduct focused field observations over three months. The ethnographic results will enable us to understand the impact of key adverse social environmental conditions on both HIV risk and prevention efforts. Participants will be recruited through community outreach workers. The woman-focused preventive intervention will be adapted from an existing manual that has been tested with drug involved women. Through a systematic qualitative process, the qualitative information will be used to adapt the intervention to tailor to the needs of the women in Tajikistan. Outcome measures will be piloted during the study. Results from this study will inform HIV prevention in Tajikistan, contribute to the science related to HIV risk and prevention with woman in adverse social environmental conditions, and lead to the development of a proposal to pilot the preventive intervention.              ",HIV Prevention with Heroin Using Women Sex Workers in Tajikistan,7230840,R03DA021108,"['heroin ', ' AIDS ', ' behavior ', ' conditioning ', ' sex ', ' socioenvironment ', ' prevention ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2006,80500,0.012453893845877981
"Refining and Standardizing Health Literacy Assessment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Low literacy is associated with health disparities in access to health information, understanding of illness / treatment, health status, understanding and use of preventive services, and hospitalizations. Better understanding of patients' health literacy would allow for targeted interventions to reduce identified disparities. However, due to assessment burden, scoring imprecision, and inadequate English and Spanish language equivalence, available health literacy measures are not optimal for use in clinical practice or research. Aims: The aims of this application are 1) to develop English and Spanish language item banks for measuring reading-related health literacy skills; 2) to evaluate the feasibility, validity and acceptability of computer-based methods for comprehensive assessment of health literacy; 3) to develop and pilot computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of health literacy in clinical settings; and 4) to use a theory-driven framework to evaluate the associations between health literacy, patient characteristics, enabling resources, needs, health behaviors related to prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and health status. Methods: State-of-the-science analytical methods will be used to develop sets of health literacy questions (""item banks"") to support brief, targeted assessment using CAT. A validated bilingual multimedia ""Talking Touchscreen"" will be adapted to administer CAT to measure health literacy in English and Spanish primary care patients. A cross-sectional study will use this tool to evaluate the associations between patient characteristics, behaviors, outcomes and health literacy. Significance: This project will advance measurement technique through the development of a state-of-the-science computer adaptive tool that will allow precise and rapid measurement of health literacy, enhance ability to distinguish between language and literacy barriers, and increase understanding of associations between health literacy, health behaviors and health outcomes.

"Literacy and Mortality Among Elderly Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low literacy is highly prevalent in the United States. According to the U.S. Department of Education's National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS) of 1992, 21 percent of adults possess skills in the lowest level of prose, document, and quantitative literacy. Another 27 percent of adults fall under the second lowest level of literacy proficiency and may be hindered in routine daily activities. The prevalence of low literacy increases dramatically with age: 44 percent of U.S. adults age 65 and older had level 1 reading skills on the NALS. Individuals with inadequate literacy have worse health in cross sectional studies and higher hospitalization rates in prospective studies. No previous study has examined whether literacy independently predicts death. In addition, the mechanisms by which literacy affects health outcomes remain unclear. The primary aims of this study are: 1) To determine whether elderly persons with inadequate or marginal functional health literacy have higher mortality than persons with adequate literacy after adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and   baseline health and chronic conditions, and 2) To determine the importance of different causal pathways between literacy and mortality and the residual effect of literacy on mortality after adjusting for all pathways examined, including a) adverse health behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, obesity, and seat belt use), b) under use of preventive services (mammography, Papanicolau smear, and pneumococcal and influenza vaccination), c) occupation and income, and d) lower levels of social support. Data from a cohort of 3260 community dwelling elderly who completed a one hour in-home interview that measured health behaviors, health care use, physical and mental health, functional health literacy (Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults) and cognitive functioning (Mini Mental Status Examination) will be linked to the National Death Index to track mortality. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to determine the independent association between literacy and mortality. The pathways described above will be sequentially added to the models to determine the change in the beta coefficients for literacy to determine the degree to which each pathway mediates the relationship between literacy and mortality.            ",Literacy and Mortality Among Elderly Persons,7110145,R01AG026393,"['human old age (65+) ', ' aging ', ' health ', ' health care service utilization ', ' interview ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' mental health ', ' psychological model ', ' human mortality ', ' health behavior ', ' cognition ', ' memory ', ' academic achievement ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' psychological aspect of aging ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2006,123258,0.1925611172637402
"'Latinos' Health Literacy, Social Support, and OH-KOP""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been suggested that low health literacy is associated with adverse health outcomes, and reduced access to needed services. Latinos' health behaviors and attitudes are known to be influenced by social and cultural factors. The prevalence of low health literacy of recent Latino immigrants in the Washington D.C. area is unknown. Further, the impact of health literacy levels in the oral health knowledge, opinions, and practices among mostly underserved Latinos is unknown. The proposed investigation will concentrate in using focus group methodology to elicit information about beliefs, viewpoints, preferred terminology and to further detail and test survey instruments designed to assess the relationship between oral health knowledge and measures of health literacy and of social support, in members of an Inner City Hispanic Community in Mount Pleasant, Washington D.C. The instruments that will be assessed and further detailed include: A previously developed oral health knowledge and practices (KOP) survey instrument, developed in the Inner City Hispanic Community of Mount Pleasant in Washington D.C.; the SAHLSA instrument -a Spanish Health Literacy Assessment Tool, and a social support survey instrument, both previously tested and validated with patients at the University of North Carolina; and Health literacy measures using REALM (in English). The results of this qualitative investigation will help improve our understanding of the social, cultural and literacy factors at play in this community as it pertains to oral health practices and care seeking behaviors, and will assist in developing and pre-testing instruments designed to assess the association of oral health knowledge and measures of health literacy considering social and cultural factors in members of an Inner City Hispanic Community. Ultimately, these instruments will serve to target oral health promotion and primary prevention efforts for Latino populations.           ","'Latinos' Health Literacy, Social Support, and OH-KOP""",7135529,R03DE016913,"['oral health ', ' health ', ' Hispanic American ', ' community ', ' urban area ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,SPANISH CATHOLIC CENTER,R03,2006,56000,0.020915125774448904
"Health Literacy Intervention for Korean Americans with HPB    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the tremendous progress that has been made in improving heart health in the US population during the last decade, many ethnic minority populations are still experiencing significant health disparity gaps. In particular, low health literacy in populations with limited English skills has undoubtedly hindered the development of effective strategies for improving health outcomes and reducing health disparity gaps. This research application is formulated in response to the widely recognized need for health literacy promoting intervention. This research effort is designed to answer research questions that address critical knowledge gaps in the field of health literacy intervention for linguistically and/or socially isolated ethnic minority communities, using the Korean American community as an example. These questions include whether or not: 1) a health literacy-focused intervention using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process will be effective in promoting health literacy and achieving better HBP outcomes in a community that is known as one of the ""hard-to reach"" populations for clinical research; and (2) an intervention delivered by lay health workers (i.e., community health workers) teamed with registered nurses will be acceptable and effective in such a community. The proposed study is a community-based, randomized clinical trial with delayed intervention and a longitudinal repeated measures design that will allow us to determine the effectiveness of the proposed health literacy-focused HBP intervention. A total of 360 Korean American seniors will participate in this study over two- year period. While the focus of this research project is literacy promotion and HBP control in Korean American immigrant seniors, it is our belief that the core components of this intervention's principles and methodology can provide meaningful insights to other researchers who are seeking to develop effective, culturally sensitive health literacy programs to meet the needs of socially and/or linguistically isolated minority groups with HBP throughout the U.S.           ",Health Literacy Intervention for Korean Americans with HPB,7136028,R01HL085567,"['human old age (65+) ', ' hypertension ', ' clinical trial ', ' cardiovascular disorder education ', ' educationally disadvantaged ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' self care ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' nonEnglish language ', ' nurse ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' health behavior ', ' problem solving ', ' Asian American ', ' self help ', ' culture ', ' therapy compliance ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' communication ', ' cardiovascular disorder therapy ', ' medically underserved population ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,701873,0.23384861719855124
"JUSTA: Justice and Health for Poultry Workers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The overall goal of this project is to address the health disparities faced by immigrant Latino poultry workers in rural, western North Carolina (NC), through a partnership (JUSTA-Justice and Health for Poultry Workers) of community advocates, environmental health sciences, and health care providers.  Workers in the poultry industry in the U.S. experience a disproportionate share of occupation-attributed musculoskeletal, skin and respiratory disorders.  Recent trends in this industry have concentrated the injuries in a worker population that is poor, minority, and comprised predominantly of immigrants.  These workers are purposively recruited into jobs rejected by the local population, and lack the means to protect themselves from hazards.  The exposures of workers also affect their families.  To bring about greater social and environmental justice for these workers, the proposed work will have two loci:  helping individual workers and their families to be more resilient to stressors, strengthening community-based organizations so that they can move toward social and regulatory change and justice.  Community advocates, health care providers and environmental health researchers will work together in this project to address five Specific Aims:  1) to encourage social action by Latino community-based advocacy groups in western NC to effect policies that reduce the burden of occupational and environmental health disparities due to employment in the poultry industry; 2) to construct the foundation on which to base educational materials and communication strategies designed to prevent or reduce exposure to physical and social occupational stressors and their effects among Latino poultry worker families; 3) to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate educational materials and implement programs that will promote ways to prevent or reduce exposure to physical and social occupational stressors and their effects among Latino poultry worker families; 4) to develop educational materials and implement programs that will better prepare health care providers to recognize and treat with cultural competence illnesses related to poultry production and processing among immigrant families, and counsel families on ways to prevent or reduce exposure; and 5) to evaluate the process and outcomes of community participation in this project so that it can be used by other community-based organizations to engage community residents in efforts to reduce environmental and occupational risks in their own communities.

"Diabetes Care in American Samoa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As type 2 diabetes prevalence increases in the United States, the burden of diabetes falls more on groups with greater barriers to care, such as language and cultural differences, and lower economic resources. Healthy People 2010 targeted diabetes as one of six diseases for the elimination of racial and ethnic health disparities. These disparities extend to the US Territory of American Samoa, where the proportion of adults >18 years with diabetes was 19.6% in 2002, compared to 6.4% of US adults. There have been no reported diabetes interventions in Samoans in the US. The overall purpose of this application is to translate recent advances in diabetes care into clinical practice for the American Samoan community by improving methods of health care delivery and improve methods of diabetes self management. We will use the community health worker model to test an expanded diabetes care model. Community health workers (CHW) have frequently been used to serve as ""bridges"" between health care services and patients in poor ethnic minority communities. CHW workers provide culturally appropriate health education and instrumental social support and facilitation, and even organization, of access to care, while also providing patient information to medical providers. We propose a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a CHW and primary-care coordinated intervention to provide outreach, education and support to 352 type 2 diabetes patients and their families in American Samoa. The outcomes at a one-year follow-up will include glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cardiovascular disease risk factors, diet and exercise behaviors, and adherence to diabetes care guidelines. The intervention builds upon best clinical practices for diabetes care by translating effective strategies to American Samoans. The translation of good diabetes care there may offer a model that is potentially replicable in other ethnic minority populations suffering the burden of diabetes.       ",Diabetes Care in American Samoa,7129138,R18DK075371,"['clinical trial ', ' noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus ', ' diabetes education ', ' glycation ', ' self care ', ' medical outreach /case finding ', ' community health service ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service planning ', ' hemoglobin A ', ' human subject ', ' health behavior ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' culture ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R18,2006,636051,0.044193336861402206

"Health Literacy Intervention for Korean Americans with HPB    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the tremendous progress that has been made in improving heart health in the US population during the last decade, many ethnic minority populations are still experiencing significant health disparity gaps. In particular, low health literacy in populations with limited English skills has undoubtedly hindered the development of effective strategies for improving health outcomes and reducing health disparity gaps. This research application is formulated in response to the widely recognized need for health literacy promoting intervention. This research effort is designed to answer research questions that address critical knowledge gaps in the field of health literacy intervention for linguistically and/or socially isolated ethnic minority communities, using the Korean American community as an example. These questions include whether or not: 1) a health literacy-focused intervention using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process will be effective in promoting health literacy and achieving better HBP outcomes in a community that is known as one of the ""hard-to reach"" populations for clinical research; and (2) an intervention delivered by lay health workers (i.e., community health workers) teamed with registered nurses will be acceptable and effective in such a community. The proposed study is a community-based, randomized clinical trial with delayed intervention and a longitudinal repeated measures design that will allow us to determine the effectiveness of the proposed health literacy-focused HBP intervention. A total of 360 Korean American seniors will participate in this study over two- year period. While the focus of this research project is literacy promotion and HBP control in Korean American immigrant seniors, it is our belief that the core components of this intervention's principles and methodology can provide meaningful insights to other researchers who are seeking to develop effective, culturally sensitive health literacy programs to meet the needs of socially and/or linguistically isolated minority groups with HBP throughout the U.S.           ",Health Literacy Intervention for Korean Americans with HPB,7284350,R01HL085567,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Information Services ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Language ', ' insight ', ' Numbers ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Glare ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Terminology ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Koreans ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social isolation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Washington ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Baltimore ', ' Belief ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' Korean American ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' member ', ' Registered nurse ', ' R.N.

"Amelioration of Literacy Deficits in Prenatal Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The literacy challenges of the medical dialogue are considerable and significant; as these challenges fall within the relatively unexplored domains of conceptual and oral literacy, they have been all but ignored in the exponentially growing literacy literature. Nevertheless, it is in the oral and conceptual literacy domains that critical issues arise in face-to-face interactions with health providers. It is here that the frustration grows in the accomplishment of the most basic of patient goals- to understand and be understood. There is reason to believe that these challenges are especially evident for low-literate women seeking prenatal care. Despite evidence of persistent socioeconomic and racial disparity in prenatal, perinatal, and post-partum services utilization and health outcomes, there has been relatively little federal focus on setting goals for the amelioration of literacy and health communication deficits affecting pregnant and post-partum women and their babies (Healthy People 2010), or in designing literacy interventions to improve health outcomes for this population. It is in the first prenatal visit that significant cognitive and emotional challenges are likely to arise in the complex information needed to make an informed choice about prenatal testing and in facing the psychosocial and emotional challenges of pregnancy. Consequently, it is the first visit that is likely to set the stage forfeiture exchanges and determine the relationship that develops, and the array of attitudinal, psychological, behavioral, and health outcomes that derive from care. The specific aims of the study are: (1) To understand the relationships among print, conceptual and oral literacy dimensions and to investigate the communication characteristics of deficits in these realms; (2) To work collaboratively with low-literate women, and health literacy experts, to develop a communication intervention designed to: (a) ameliorate oral and conceptual literacy deficits related to informed choice regarding prenatal genetic testing and (b)to facilitate disclosure and discussion about sensitive emotional and psychosocial topics, and (3) to conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the effect of the intervention on a variety of outcomes including: interaction, understanding, satisfaction, prenatal care utilization, post-partum appointment keeping, antenatal and post-partum depression symptoms, and pre-term deliveries.

"Click to Connect: Improving Health Literacy through Internet Literacy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health Literacy is defined as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions (US DHHS, 2000). Yet there is well-documented evidence for profound inequalities in the distribution of communications services, the digital divide, and advantages accruing from it thus threatening the normative goal of developing a health literate public. The research question guiding this project is: Does improving access to the Internet, and training in how to use the Internet for health information, among the socially disadvantaged lead to changes in health literacy, and secondarily in health knowledge and beliefs about health compared to a control group in usual care condition? We will recruit 258 subjects from adult education centers in Boston, the most diverse city in New England, and randomize them to either the intervention or control conditions. 129 subjects in the intervention group will be provided with free computers and high-speed Internet at home. They will also be provided with training on how to use computers and navigate the Internet, as well as a web portal that will help in the use of the Internet for one year. Intervention will occur in three waves with 43 subjects per wave per year. Baseline and post-Intervention data .will be gathered through a telephone survey of subjects in both groups and Internet and computer use will be tracked in the Intervention group. The data from this project will provide the necessary information to design future information architecture that can address health literacy and digital divide issues specific to the needs of the socially disadvantaged.           ",Click to Connect: Improving Health Literacy through Internet Literacy,7276145,R01CA122894,"['Decision Making ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Improve Access ', ' Information and Communication Theory ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' communication behavior ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Medical ', ' Information Services ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' literacy ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Mass Media ', ' mass information media ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Exposure to ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Social Class ', ' Knowledge ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Score ', ' Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Services ', ' Boston ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' literate ', ' Reporting ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Communication ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2007,534651,0.18246959464931023
"Literacy & Maternal Health; Defining Obstacles to Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This revised application for an NICHD Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) seeks support to develop a program of research related to social factors contributing to disparities in maternal-child health. In particular, I am interested in identifying obstacles to preventive pediatric care for preterm infants related to maternal low literacy. While low literacy is common in populations with high rates of preterm birth and has been associated with poor care utilization in other settings little to nothing is known about the role of literacy in the utilization of pediatric care. This research is designed to lay the groundwork for a community based intervention to reduce obstacles to effective pediatric care utilization faced by women with low literacy. The proposed course of study includes: 1) an educational component, and 2) a research plan to be carried out through three linked studies. Study 1 is an analysis of a prospective study of low income, inner-city women following a preterm birth (< 35 weeks gestation; n=700). The goal of this study is to examine the association between maternal literacy and preventive pediatric care (well child visits and Up to Date vaccination status) as well as to assess potential mediators of this association. Study 2, with the same population, will utilize qualitative methods to clarify factors identified in Study 1 and uncover new obstacles to care from the perspective of the mothers. Study 3 utilizes the findings of the preceding work to develop a community based intervention to modify the obstacles identified in Studies 1 and 2. A home visiting model used widely to deliver services to low income women and their infants will be adapted to include health and literacy instruction to address the identified obstacles to pediatric care utilization. The educational component focuses on specific areas of advanced social science methodology, statistical methods, and the assessment of adult literacy, as well as the design of intervention trials, which are needed for the planned research studies and subsequent independent research career. This work will result in an R01 intervention study proposal to be submitted in the fourth year. The proposed research represents a unique opportunity to study the role of low literacy and pediatric care utilization in a setting in which the benefits of effective utilization are clear and well defined. The results of this work will also have important implications for understanding the role of literacy in health care utilization for the larger group of term infants.              ",Literacy & Maternal Health; Defining Obstacles to Care,7259871,K23HD048915,"['Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Range ', ' Research Training ', ' Supplementation ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Infant Health ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' literacy ', ' satisfaction ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mothers ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Vaccination ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Week ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' size ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' Services ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' Budgets ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Case Management ', ' Mediating ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' health literacy ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' task analysis ', ' service utilization ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2007,132988,0.07775746761759104
"Examination of Oral Health Literacy in Public Health Practice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  According to the 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey, 25 percent of US adults are functionally illiterate. Because written health information is frequently provided at above the tenth grade level, health messages are not reaching low literacy patients jeopardizing their health status. Low literacy has been found by researchers to have a detrimental effect on general health and the use of medical services. Evidence from research in medical settings consistently highlights the importance of comprehension and literacy for patient compliance and increased positive health outcomes. Although much is known about medical health literacy, there are no studies that have systematically studied oral health literacy. The purpose of this current application is to examine how a low dental literacy population interprets dental health prevention information, navigates the dental health system and whether participation in a large comprehensive public health program (WIC) can be effective in improving this process for pregnant women and their children and reduce health disparities. Specifically, we will: 1) Determine the dental health literacy rates among a low income, high risk population, 2) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in understanding preventive dental health information such as consent forms, oral hygiene instructions and compliance to fluoride instructions among a low income/low dental health literacy population 3) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in navigating the .dental health care system among a low income/low dental literacy population including compliance for dental appointments and appropriate use and 4) Evaluate the effects of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program on cumulative treatment and costs of dental services provided by Medicaid as well as oral health related quality of life in a population with low dental health literacy.           ",Examination of Oral Health Literacy in Public Health Practice,7303447,R01DE018045,"['Surgeon ', ' American ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' skills ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Measures ', ' Tooth Loss ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' health related quality of life ', ' care systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Navigation System ', ' Consent Forms ', ' Informed Consent Forms ', ' Informed Consent Documents ', ' Consent Documents ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Drug Labeling ', ' Drug Product Labeling ', ' Drug Package Inserts ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Low income ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Comprehension ', ' Fluorides ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Gingivitis ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Medical ', ' Infant ', ' Dental ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Patients ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Appointment ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Adopted ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' illiterate ', ' Services ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2007,365000,0.030460067913505032
"Boundary Crossings: Re-Situating Cultural Competence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This 4 year longitudinal, urban, multi-method ethnographic study will examine cross cultural healthcare encounters. The study will identify, describe and situate how families contribute to the production of culturally responsive care and the strategies families and practitioners employ to establish commonality, bridge difference, and effectively ""partner up."" This is a continuation of Boundary Crossing: A Longitudinal and Ethnographic Study (R01 HD 38878, 2000-2004). It builds upon research conducted with a cohort of African American children with special health care needs, their primary caregivers, extended family networks, and the practitioners who serve them. Although there is an overwhelming body of literature confirming health care disparities for ethnic minorities, there is a striking paucity of strategies to address this significant public health issue. Much research on cultural competence radically underestimates how much work families do to achieve culturally competent care. Longitudinal and learning aspects are under-described, as are their strengths and resources families bring to healthcare encounters. The proposed research is both events centered and longitudinal. We will examine how discrete moments of healthcare encounters produce effects across both contexts and time, influencing developmental trajectories, family life, and health and therapeutic outcomes. The anticipated outcomes of this project are a description and interpretation of: 1) the knowledge and strategies families bring to shape encounters and generate desirable outcomes; 2) how families and practitioners revise their strategies; 3) how practitioners, family, and children develop and draw upon their history of shared endeavors; 4) how practitioners shape intervention to the unique needs and strengths of family and child; 5) how families and practitioners challenge and attempt to disconfirm stereotypes; and 6) the cultural resources practitioners and families draw upon. Findings that will result from this study will facilitate a reconsideration of dominant models of cultural competence and health literacy at multiple policy levels.

"Worker Health and Safety Training Cooperative Agreement    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)      The Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC) formed by The Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union (PACE), the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and the Labor Institute (together representing over 875,000 industrial workers) will conduct over the next 5 years approximately 3,800 workshops reaching 86,000 workers and community residents with 900,000 hours of training to prevent hazardous substance emergencies and to protect workers and communities should such accidents occur. The model training will consist of courses that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120, address environmental justice and health disparities, and assist worker-trainer development and evaluation.  Specific Aims include to, 1) expand model site-based training, called ITS programs, to meld 1910.120-based training into broad, ongoing plant-wide prevention programs. The TMC will add 8 ITS programs per year (total of 40 new sites) to our existing 35 sites resulting in 72 total sites at the end of five years involving an estimated 30,000 workers and managers.  In addition, the goals are to, 2) pilot a new Near-miss Initiative working with the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center of the University of Pennsylvania; 3) conduct community/labor workshops with regional environmental justice networks and Latino workers; 4) expand the use of advanced training technologies including web-based lessons learned, e-learning and emergency response simulation programs; 5) use participatory research and evaluation to monitor and strengthen the program; and 6) lead a multi-grantee (seven unions) initiative to work together on trainer, curriculum and evaluation development.  With the HDPTP supplement the TMC will help protect workers and community residents from potential exposures to hazardous materials released during terrorist attacks on industrial facilities with large volumes of highly hazardous chemicals, specifically at the 306 Risk Management Program Sites (RMPs) at which PACE and USWA represent 75,000 workers.  The TMC will reach 19,700 participants with 192,360 contact hours of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) prevention, preparedness and response training.

"Refining and Standardizing Health Literacy Assessment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Low literacy is associated with health disparities in access to health information, understanding of illness / treatment, health status, understanding and use of preventive services, and hospitalizations. Better understanding of patients' health literacy would allow for targeted interventions to reduce identified disparities. However, due to assessment burden, scoring imprecision, and inadequate English and Spanish language equivalence, available health literacy measures are not optimal for use in clinical practice or research. Aims: The aims of this application are 1) to develop English and Spanish language item banks for measuring reading-related health literacy skills; 2) to evaluate the feasibility, validity and acceptability of computer-based methods for comprehensive assessment of health literacy; 3) to develop and pilot computerized adaptive testing (CAT) of health literacy in clinical settings; and 4) to use a theory-driven framework to evaluate the associations between health literacy, patient characteristics, enabling resources, needs, health behaviors related to prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and health status. Methods: State-of-the-science analytical methods will be used to develop sets of health literacy questions (""item banks"") to support brief, targeted assessment using CAT. A validated bilingual multimedia ""Talking Touchscreen"" will be adapted to administer CAT to measure health literacy in English and Spanish primary care patients. A cross-sectional study will use this tool to evaluate the associations between patient characteristics, behaviors, outcomes and health literacy. Significance: This project will advance measurement technique through the development of a state-of-the-science computer adaptive tool that will allow precise and rapid measurement of health literacy, enhance ability to distinguish between language and literacy barriers, and increase understanding of associations between health literacy, health behaviors and health outcomes.

"Health Literacy and Oral Health Knowledge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is defined as a combination of attributes that can explain and predict one's ability to access, understand, and apply health information. Approximately 90 million American adults lack these necessary skills. To date, studies of health literacy have used tests of reading recognition or tests of reading comprehension and numeracy to categorize health literacy status. No studies have included writing, speaking, or listening skills, and none have included cultural factors or basic conceptual knowledge - all thought to contribute to health literacy. The lack of basic conceptual knowledge data is particularly important because knowing how to prevent and manage disease depends not only on one's reading comprehension and numeracy skills, but also on one's ability to place that information in a meaningful context. Researchers hypothesize that oral health disparities are influenced by health literacy, although little research has been done to support that position. The overall goal of the proposed research project is to study health literacy in an oral health context while including a measure of basic conceptual knowledge in the analysis. The specific aims of the proposed research project are to: 1) develop a valid instrument to assess basic conceptual knowledge of oral health and illness; 2) develop a valid instrument to assess knowledge of oral disease prevention and management; and 3) determine to what extent basic conceptual knowledge exists as an effect modifier of the association between reading comprehension and numeracy and knowledge of oral disease prevention and management. The two knowledge instruments will be developed with the guidance of an expert panel and tested for reliability and validity during pilot testing. Associations between reading comprehension/numeracy and knowledge of oral disease prevention and management will be tested among a probability sample of adults from the Baltimore metropolitan area. Public health relevance: Successful completion will show how basic conceptual knowledge interacts with reading comprehension/numeracy, and how it is associated with knowledge of oral disease prevention and management information. Deterrmining this association will advance understanding of health literacy in oral health research and will guide the development of appropriate health information for persons with all levels of health literacy. It is anticipated that these results will ultimately improve oral health and eliminate disparities in the United States.           ",Health Literacy and Oral Health Knowledge,7269478,R03DE016934,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Information Management ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Comprehension ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Dental ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Persons ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Probability Samples ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' instrument ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' United States ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Complex ', ' Baltimore ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Practice Management ', ' skills ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Measures ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R03,2007,68767,-0.028214870341031505
"Providers' Views of the Roles of Medical Interpreters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The importance of medical interpreters to improve the health literacy of patients with limited English proficiency (LEP; e.g., through effective communication with health care providers) has been widely recognized; however their roles and functions are less understood and more widely debated. Although there are a few studies that have examined how interpreters understand their roles in health care settings, no studies have examined health care providers' expectations for the roles of interpreters and the quality of bilingual health communication. The objective of the study is to generate a new communication theory that highlights providers' communicative goals during a medical encounter and educates interpreters to respond to the providers' needs more effectively. The specific aims of this study are (a) to assess providers' experiences with, perceptions of, attitudes about, expectations for medical interpreters and (b) to explore differences in these dimensions across different medical specialties. The proposed study is a two-year project, involving both qualitative and quantitative methods. In year one, focus groups will be conducted with health care providers who have worked with medical interpreters to explore their views of interpreter-mediated interactions. In year two, based on the themes and categories developed from the focus group interviews, the Principal Investigator will develop a questionnaire to survey health care providers about their attitudes about medical interpreters. The use of focus groups in year one to develop and test questionnaires in year two will increase the reliability and validity of the instrument. The specific research questions are: (a) What are providers' experiences with and attitudes about the communicative strategies used by interpreters? (b) What are the criteria used by providers to evaluate the success of bilingual health communication?; (c) What are providers' expectations for interpreters' roles and performances?; and (d) Do providers in different specialties vary in their perceptions, attitudes, and expectations? Answering these questions will allow the Principal Investigator to develop a program of research that includes further developing bilingual health communication theory and designing training programs to increase health literacy of patients with LEP.           ",Providers' Views of the Roles of Medical Interpreters,7278276,R03MH076205,"['Codes of Ethics ', ' Ethical Codes ', ' Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Medical Ethics ', ' Caring ', ' Health Communication ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Gills ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Medical ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Inequality ', ' Methods ', ' Collaborations ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' tool ', ' Questionnaires ', ' instrument ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Silver ', ' Ag element ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Behavior ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Modeling ', ' communication theory ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R03,2007,71078,0.07182450214748531
"Diabetes Care in American Samoa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As type 2 diabetes prevalence increases in the United States, the burden of diabetes falls more on groups with greater barriers to care, such as language and cultural differences, and lower economic resources. Healthy People 2010 targeted diabetes as one of six diseases for the elimination of racial and ethnic health disparities. These disparities extend to the US Territory of American Samoa, where the proportion of adults >18 years with diabetes was 19.6% in 2002, compared to 6.4% of US adults. There have been no reported diabetes interventions in Samoans in the US. The overall purpose of this application is to translate recent advances in diabetes care into clinical practice for the American Samoan community by improving methods of health care delivery and improve methods of diabetes self management. We will use the community health worker model to test an expanded diabetes care model. Community health workers (CHW) have frequently been used to serve as ""bridges"" between health care services and patients in poor ethnic minority communities. CHW workers provide culturally appropriate health education and instrumental social support and facilitation, and even organization, of access to care, while also providing patient information to medical providers. We propose a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a CHW and primary-care coordinated intervention to provide outreach, education and support to 352 type 2 diabetes patients and their families in American Samoa. The outcomes at a one-year follow-up will include glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cardiovascular disease risk factors, diet and exercise behaviors, and adherence to diabetes care guidelines. The intervention builds upon best clinical practices for diabetes care by translating effective strategies to American Samoans. The translation of good diabetes care there may offer a model that is potentially replicable in other ethnic minority populations suffering the burden of diabetes.       ",Diabetes Care in American

"JUSTA: Justice and Health for Poultry Workers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The overall goal of this project is to address the health disparities faced by immigrant Latino poultry workers in rural, western North Carolina (NC), through a partnership (JUSTA-Justice and Health for Poultry Workers) of community advocates, environmental health sciences, and health care providers.  Workers in the poultry industry in the U.S. experience a disproportionate share of occupation-attributed musculoskeletal, skin and respiratory disorders.  Recent trends in this industry have concentrated the injuries in a worker population that is poor, minority, and comprised predominantly of immigrants.  These workers are purposively recruited into jobs rejected by the local population, and lack the means to protect themselves from hazards.  The exposures of workers also affect their families.  To bring about greater social and environmental justice for these workers, the proposed work will have two loci:  helping individual workers and their families to be more resilient to stressors, strengthening community-based organizations so that they can move toward social and regulatory change and justice.  Community advocates, health care providers and environmental health researchers will work together in this project to address five Specific Aims:  1) to encourage social action by Latino community-based advocacy groups in western NC to effect policies that reduce the burden of occupational and environmental health disparities due to employment in the poultry industry; 2) to construct the foundation on which to base educational materials and communication strategies designed to prevent or reduce exposure to physical and social occupational stressors and their effects among Latino poultry worker families; 3) to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate educational materials and implement programs that will promote ways to prevent or reduce exposure to physical and social occupational stressors and their effects among Latino poultry worker families; 4) to develop educational materials and implement programs that will better prepare health care providers to recognize and treat with cultural competence illnesses related to poultry production and processing among immigrant families, and counsel families on ways to prevent or reduce exposure; and 5) to evaluate the process and outcomes of community participation in this project so that it can be used by other community-based organizations to engage community residents in efforts to reduce environmental and occupational risks in their own communities.

"A Multifaceted Adaptive Testing Approach to Health Literacy in Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent changes in the healthcare system necessitate that health consumers and patients play a more active role in the management of their health. Older adults, in particular, face many challenges in today's health care environment in terms of the increased complexity of health care systems and the proliferation of health information from numerous and diverse sources. Health literacy skills are needed for communication with healthcare providers, reading and understanding health information, medication compliance, using medical devices and making decisions about treatment options. Health literacy is lower among people aged 7 65, especially ethnic minorities and those with lower socio-economic status. Current measures of health literacy are limited in scope and inadequate in diagnosing specific literacy-related problems. The overall objective of this study is to develop and validate a health literacy instrument for older adults employing state-of-art computer-adaptive testing methods and technology. The first aim is to develop a comprehensive framework for identifying and measuring the core competencies that older adult consumers need to understand, access and use health related information and services. Towards that end, we will engage in a series of formative research activities including a systematic review of existing measures, convening an expert panel on health literacy and performing a series of cognitive task analyses on health related activities (e.g., glucose testing). This will contribute to the development and implementation of conceptual knowledge and numeracy modules. The prototype modules will be implemented as adaptive tests based on measurement decision theory. A preliminary study with 15 older adults at varying levels of health literacy will be conducted to develop testing norms. The data will be analyzed by investigators and scrutinized by members of the expert panel. On that basis, we will revise the 2 modules and subject it to a larger validation study with 2 groups of older adults: 1) ages 60-74 and 2) 75-85. A primary strength of this application is that we are addressing an issue of considerable and growing importance using a theoretically-grounded framework that greatly expands the scope of health literacy assessment. A comprehensive health literacy framework as described in this application can be used to support research on health literacy, develop screening tools for clinicians and tailor health education materials for older adult adults at varying levels of literacy. Public Health Relevance: literacy problems exist to a large extent because health information and services systems are unfamiliar and complex, which makes their effective utilization difficult for most people, especially for older adults. We are proposing to develop a health literacy assessment tool based on a comprehensive framework. The tool has the potential to be used to support research on health literacy, develop screening tools for clinicians and tailor health education materials for older adult patients and consumers at varying levels of literacy.             ",A Multifaceted Adaptive Testing Approach to Health Literacy in Older Adults,7432986,R21NR010710,"['Decision Making ', ' Decision Theory ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Review, Systematic (PT) ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Support of Research ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Series ', ' Information Services ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' literacy ', ' Research Activity ', ' Measurement ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' instrument ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Knowledge ', ' Arts ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' validation studies ', ' literate ', ' Today ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Self Management ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Communication ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' prototype ', ' Computers ', ' Measures ', ' ']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2008,221400,0.11370023186759637
"Determinants of Asian Immigrant Workers' Mental Health and Work Performance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for a K01 Mentored Career Development Award (PAR-04-105) for Dr. Tsai to develop expertise in theory-based multivariate model testing methods, population-based survey design, intervention research, and social determinants of occupational safety and health (OSH) disparities among Asian immigrant workers. Dr. Tsai is an Assistant Professor with well-honed qualitative research skills. Her immediate career goal is to facilitate her development as an independent researcher by acquiring new skills in advanced quantitative methods and refining her community-partnered research expertise in the area of Asian immigrant worker health and safety. Ultimately, this career development award will lead to a R01 proposal based on the research completed as the result of this proposed project. Dr. Tsai's longer-term career goals are to integrate these research findings into practice and policy for improved Asian immigrant worker health and to identify factors amenable to interventions that promote a healthier USAsian immigrant workforce. She will acquire new knowledge and skills through mentored research activities, selected coursework, participations in research seminars, and active participation in research dissemination through scientific presentations and publications. Traditionally, OSH research focuses on the effects of workplace physical, chemical, and biological hazards on workers' health and safety. To create a more comprehensive approach to promoting worker health and safety, social and workplace determinants of health need to be considered. The proposed research project includes two studies. Study 1 maximizes an opportunity to use the NIAAA/NIH Filipino American Community Epidemiological Study (fACES) to test the influence of social discrimination, job concerns, and social support on immigrant workers' mental health problems and substance use. Study 2 extends the investigation of these factors with a sample of Chinese immigrants. Importantly, Study 2 will investigate the added influence of workplace support, and work performance as a distal outcome mediated by mental health problems and substance use. The proposed project will generate knowledge for designing theory-driven preventive interventions for promoting health and safety among Chinese and Filipino immigrant workers, an underrepresented population in OSH research. Dr. Tsai will be mentored by Drs. Salazar and Thompson, two well-funded researchers at the University of Washington (UW), and she will have access to resources in this research-intenstive environment. Dr. Takeuchi, a US lead researcher in Asian immigrant and Asian American health and a Professor at the UW, will serve as consultant on Dr. Tsai's mentorship team. This award will secure sufficient research time for Dr. Tsai to expand her quantitative research skills and to build a solid base for launching her program of research.           ",Determinants of Asian Immigrant Workers' Mental Health and Work Performance,7360827,K01OH009308,[''],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2008,108000,0.01930761694118024
"Surveillance of mortality and Morbidity in US workers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Race-ethnicity and socio-economic status health disparities in occupational health have not been extensively investigated. Although significantly under-reported, occupational disease and injury, and mortality represent a significant health impact on US workers and their families. However, the risks for this occupational mortality and morbidity are not evenly distributed. It appears that these risks disproportionately affect US workers from race-ethnicity subpopulations and from lower socio-economic class. The University of Miami NIOSH NHIS Research Group proposes to use their existing Study Database derived from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), augmented by newly released NHIS data, to explore issues of health disparities among US workers based on differences between race-ethnic and socio- economic classes. The augmented NHIS database of a representative sample of over 660,000 US workers will allow the exploration of morbidity and mortality differences between and within occupations by various race ethnic subpopulations and by socio-economic class. Based on their previous work, the Investigators propose to pursue more sophisticated theoretical models to evaluate pathways of occupational risk, and morbidity and mortality between and within occupational subgroups. The use of these models will allow the Investigators to assess the relationship between occupation, indicators of morbidity, and the risk of mortality, testing whether or not the mortality risks noted in worker subgroups are mediated by morbidity. In addition, the Investigators propose to use the new NHIS data and the additional statistical modeling to explore the issue of health disparities among US workers based on different socio-economic and race-ethnicity subpopulations. Finally, the Investigators propose to produce an additional interactive Monograph on Health Disparities and Occupation in US Workers that will be made available through the expanded Study Website www.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/niehs/niosh/). This study proposal satisfies at least 3 NIOSH research priority areas (NORA): Surveillance research methods with unique mortality and morbidity data on 1) the entire US workforce; 2) older, race-ethnic, lower socio-economic and gender-specific worker subpopulations; and 3) social and economic costs of workplace disease and injury.           ",Surveillance of mortality and Morbidity in US workers,7373225,R01OH003915,[''],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2008,306000,0.023891081014458082
"Worker Health and Safety Training Cooperative Agreement    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)      The Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC) formed by The Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union (PACE), the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and the Labor Institute (together representing over 875,000 industrial workers) will conduct over the next 5 years approximately 3,800 workshops reaching 86,000 workers and community residents with 900,000 hours of training to prevent hazardous substance emergencies and to protect workers and communities should such accidents occur. The model training will consist of courses that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120, address environmental justice and health disparities, and assist worker-trainer development and evaluation.  Specific Aims include to, 1) expand model site-based training, called ITS programs, to meld 1910.120-based training into broad, ongoing plant-wide prevention programs. The TMC will add 8 ITS programs per year (total of 40 new sites) to our existing 35 sites resulting in 72 total sites at the end of five years involving an estimated 30,000 workers and managers.  In addition, the goals are to, 2) pilot a new Near-miss Initiative working with the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center of the University of Pennsylvania; 3) conduct community/labor workshops with regional environmental justice networks and Latino workers; 4) expand the use of advanced training technologies including web-based lessons learned, e-learning and emergency response simulation programs; 5) use participatory research and evaluation to monitor and strengthen the program; and 6) lead a multi-grantee (seven unions) initiative to work together on trainer, curriculum and evaluation development.  With the HDPTP supplement the TMC will help protect workers and community residents from potential exposures to hazardous materials released during terrorist attacks on industrial facilities with large volumes of highly hazardous chemicals, specifically at the 306 Risk Management Program Sites (RMPs) at which PACE and USWA represent 75,000 workers.  The TMC will reach 19,700 participants with 192,360 contact hours of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) prevention, preparedness and response training.  The TMC will also recruit and train an entirely new, nation-wide, industrial catastrophic incident Prevention, Preparedness and Response (PPR) Corps composed of 68 experienced workers from RMP sites. The PPR Corps, consisting of credentialed industrial responders, will work with OSHA, and through OSHA, the DHS to assist in OSHA's Regional Emergency Response Plans for high hazard sites. The PPR Corps will train industrial site workers, management and community responders, as well as conduct facility audits to evaluate prevention activities, emergency preparedness, and readiness to create site safety plans in the event of a catastrophe.         ",Worker Health and Safety Training Cooperative Agreement,7480182,U45ES006175,"['Credentialing ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Ally ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' GNA12 gene ', ' NNX3 ', ' GNA12 ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Address ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' International ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Hazardous Chemicals ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Health ', ' Site ', ' Institutes ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Justice ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Americas ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Paper ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Plants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Risk Management ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Safety ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' deoxyhypusine synthase ', ' spermidine dehydrogenase (NAD, L-deoxyhypusyl-forming) ', ' EC 2.5.1.46 ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Accidents ', ' Communities ', ' Community Workers ', ' ']",NIEHS,STEELWORKER CHARITABLE/EDUCATIONAL ORG,U45,2008,1841119,0.06355940784346867
"Health Literacy Intervention for Korean Americans with HPB    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the tremendous progress that has been made in improving heart health in the US population during the last decade, many ethnic minority populations are still experiencing significant health disparity gaps. In particular, low health literacy in populations with limited English skills has undoubtedly hindered the development of effective strategies for improving health outcomes and reducing health disparity gaps. This research application is formulated in response to the widely recognized need for health literacy promoting intervention. This research effort is designed to answer research questions that address critical knowledge gaps in the field of health literacy intervention for linguistically and/or socially isolated ethnic minority communities, using the Korean American community as an example. These questions include whether or not: 1) a health literacy-focused intervention using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process will be effective in promoting health literacy and achieving better HBP outcomes in a community that is known as one of the ""hard-to reach"" populations for clinical research; and (2) an intervention delivered by lay health workers (i.e., community health workers) teamed with registered nurses will be acceptable and effective in such a community. The proposed study is a community-based, randomized clinical trial with delayed intervention and a longitudinal repeated measures design that will allow us to determine the effectiveness of the proposed health literacy-focused HBP intervention. A total of 360 Korean American seniors will participate in this study over two- year period. While the focus of this research project is literacy promotion and HBP control in Korean American immigrant seniors, it is our belief that the core components of this intervention's principles and methodology can provide meaningful insights to other researchers who are seeking to develop effective, culturally sensitive health literacy programs to meet the needs of socially and/or linguistically isolated minority groups with HBP throughout the U.S.           ",Health Literacy Intervention for Korean Americans with HPB,7473111,R01HL085567,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Information Services ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Language ', ' insight ', ' Numbers ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Glare ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' member ', ' Registered nurse ', ' R.N.

"Community Alliance for Research Empowering Social Change (C.A.R.E.S)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Public Health and Health Policy Research at Stony Brook University in collaboration with Literacy Suffolk Inc propose to develop a Community Alliance for Research Empowering Social Change (CARES). CARES will consist of an interdisciplinary team of researchers, community based organizations and community members working together to improve minority health and eliminate racial/ethnic health disparities on Long Island through health literacy and education. This initiative will be developed through the strategic alliances of the Graduate Program in Public Health, the Suffolk County Department of Health Services, and a coalition of community members. This unique consortium will provide the necessary infrastructure for community-based participatory research. Long Island is one of the most mature and affluent suburbs in the nation with a population of approximately 3 million people. However, it is also considered the most segregated suburb in the nation, leaving its low-income residents vulnerable to poor health outcomes. Due Long Island's affluence and historical institutionalized housing practices, neighborhoods with high poverty rates are also communities of color. Utilizing community based participatory methods; we will examine the social and behavioral risk factors for racial/ethnic minorities on Long Island. Specifically, we will examine the chronic illnesses that disproportionately impact minority populations; work with our community coalition to develop and implement culturally competent evidence-based interventions; and disseminate those findings to our community members. The Center for Public Health and Health Policy Research strives to bridge the gap between community and research. Literacy Suffolk, Inc. believes that the ability to read, write, and communicate effectively is critical to personal freedom and the maintenance of a democratic society. Through CARES we will utilize the existing resources and social networks of our communities to encourage minorities to participate in research, in order to improve minority health outcomes on Long Island as well as empower our communities to participate in social change.          ",Community Alliance for Research Empowering Social Change (C.A.R.E.S),7556416,R03HD061220,"['Political Factor ', ' Poverty ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Societies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Belief ', ' member ', ' social ', ' County ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Research Ethics Committees ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' health literacy ', ' forging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Long Island ', ' community based participatory research ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Social Network ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Policy Research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Behavioral ', ' Foundations ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' base ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' minority health ', ' Housing ', ' Left ', ' Phase ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' insight ', ' Trust ', ' literacy ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Collaborations ', ' ']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R03,2008,31500,0.05133920640406748
"Click to Connect: Improving Health Literacy through Internet Literacy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health Literacy is defined as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions (US DHHS, 2000). Yet there is well-documented evidence for profound inequalities in the distribution of communications services, the digital divide, and advantages accruing from it thus threatening the normative goal of developing a health literate public. The research question guiding this project is: Does improving access to the Internet, and training in how to use the Internet for health information, among the socially disadvantaged lead to changes in health literacy, and secondarily in health knowledge and beliefs about health compared to a control group in usual care condition? We will recruit 258 subjects from adult education centers in Boston, the most diverse city in New England, and randomize them to either the intervention or control conditions. 129 subjects in the intervention group will be provided with free computers and high-speed Internet at home. They will also be provided with training on how to use computers and navigate the Internet, as well as a web portal that will help in the use of the Internet for one year. Intervention will occur in three waves with 43 subjects per wave per year. Baseline and post-Intervention data .will be gathered through a telephone survey of subjects in both groups and Internet and computer use will be tracked in the Intervention group. The data from this project will provide the necessary information to design future information architecture that can address health literacy and digital divide issues specific to the needs of the socially disadvantaged.           ",Click to Connect: Improving Health Literacy through Internet Literacy,7435349,R01CA122894,"['design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Exposure to ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Social Class ', ' Knowledge ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Score ', ' Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Services ', ' Boston ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' literate ', ' Reporting ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Communication ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Decision Making ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Improve Access ', ' Information and Communication Theory ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' communication behavior ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Medical ', ' Information Services ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' literacy ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Mass Media ', ' mass information media ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2008,538475,0.18246959464931023
"serial radio program for health promotion ABSTRACT  African Americans suffer a disproportionate health burden from chronic diseases and conditions such as obesity, cancer, hypertension and stroke, diabetes, asthma and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, African Americans experience significantly more premature morbidity and mortality compared to white Americans. Traditional means of reaching African Americans with health messages has had limited success largely due to limitations in using culturally appropriate messages and media. Public health needs demand the development of health communication strategies with increased appeal as well as demonstrated efficacy to reach the African American community. BioTechnical Communications, Inc. (BTC), the applicant organization, is proposing to use two communications technologies - Black radio and the Internet, to raise awareness and improve knowledge and attitudes about chronic diseases and their risk factors experienced by this target population. The commercial success of Black radio comes from an ability to address the unique cultural niche central to African American life. Humor, appeal to family unity, struggles of urban life, and celebration of cultural heritage are some of the many characteristics popular on contemporary Black radio. The emerging technology of web casting, made possible by the Internet, will, in addition, allow us to test another potentially highly effective medium for health information delivery to Black Americans. Our long-term goal is to have a measurable impact on the health literacy of the African American community using a culturally relevant and effective medium to improve public health and decrease health disparities.  Based on the successful completion of a Phase I project testing the feasibility of a radio formatted Entertainment-Education strategy to promote education about cancer, BTC will now proceed with the Phase II proposal to launch a professionally produced 40-episode health education serial radio drama with a companion web-based component. Our health education focus has broadened to address the particular health burdens experienced by African Americans in the U.S. - obesity, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension/stroke. This project will use a medium that transcends social class and can be used effectively especially given the heterogeneity of the Black radio audience. 7.

The second component of  the Project Summary/Abstract (i.e., Description) is Relevance. Using no  more than two or three sentences, describe the relevance of this research  to public health. In this section, be succinct and use plain language that can  be understood by a general, lay audience.  African-Americans have a disproportionately high prevalence of chronic diseases contributing to an overall increased rate of morbidity and reduced life expectancy as compared to other US populationsi,ii,iii. The proposed serial health-based radio program builds on prior research that suggests that African- American consumers very much want health information that speaks specifically to their needs and want media to do more to disseminate the informationiv. The health-based radio program will provide an innovative and effective format to improve health literacy, using a medium (radio) that is accessible and familiar to the target population. i American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts & Figures for African-Americans, 2005-2006. ii American Diabetes Association, African-American and Diabetes Facts, 2006. iii DHHS, Office of Minority Health, Black or African-American Populations Fact Sheet, 2006. iv Critical Coverage: A National Survey on Blacks, Media and Health,"" 1998, The Henry J.

"Diabetes Care in American Samoa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As type 2 diabetes prevalence increases in the United States, the burden of diabetes falls more on groups with greater barriers to care, such as language and cultural differences, and lower economic resources. Healthy People 2010 targeted diabetes as one of six diseases for the elimination of racial and ethnic health disparities. These disparities extend to the US Territory of American Samoa, where the proportion of adults >18 years with diabetes was 19.6% in 2002, compared to 6.4% of US adults. There have been no reported diabetes interventions in Samoans in the US. The overall purpose of this application is to translate recent advances in diabetes care into clinical practice for the American Samoan community by improving methods of health care delivery and improve methods of diabetes self management. We will use the community health worker model to test an expanded diabetes care model. Community health workers (CHW) have frequently been used to serve as ""bridges"" between health care services and patients in poor ethnic minority communities. CHW workers provide culturally appropriate health education and instrumental social support and facilitation, and even organization, of access to care, while also providing patient information to medical providers. We propose a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a CHW and primary-care coordinated intervention to provide outreach, education and support to 352 type 2 diabetes patients and their families in American Samoa. The outcomes at a one-year follow-up will include glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cardiovascular disease risk factors, diet and exercise behaviors, and adherence to diabetes care guidelines. The intervention builds upon best clinical practices for diabetes care by translating effective strategies to American Samoans. The translation of good diabetes care there may offer a model that is potentially replicable in other ethnic minority populations suffering the burden of diabetes.       ",Diabetes Care in American

"Examination of Oral Health Literacy in Public Health Practice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  According to the 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey, 25 percent of US adults are functionally illiterate. Because written health information is frequently provided at above the tenth grade level, health messages are not reaching low literacy patients jeopardizing their health status. Low literacy has been found by researchers to have a detrimental effect on general health and the use of medical services. Evidence from research in medical settings consistently highlights the importance of comprehension and literacy for patient compliance and increased positive health outcomes. Although much is known about medical health literacy, there are no studies that have systematically studied oral health literacy. The purpose of this current application is to examine how a low dental literacy population interprets dental health prevention information, navigates the dental health system and whether participation in a large comprehensive public health program (WIC) can be effective in improving this process for pregnant women and their children and reduce health disparities. Specifically, we will: 1) Determine the dental health literacy rates among a low income, high risk population, 2) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in understanding preventive dental health information such as consent forms, oral hygiene instructions and compliance to fluoride instructions among a low income/low dental health literacy population 3) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in navigating the .dental health care system among a low income/low dental literacy population including compliance for dental appointments and appropriate use and 4) Evaluate the effects of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program on cumulative treatment and costs of dental services provided by Medicaid as well as oral health related quality of life in a population with low dental health literacy.           ",Examination of Oral Health Literacy in Public Health Practice,7452457,R01DE018045,"['Correlation Studies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Drug Labeling ', ' Drug Product Labeling ', ' Drug Package Inserts ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Low income ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Comprehension ', ' Fluorides ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Gingivitis ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Medical ', ' Infant ', ' Dental ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Patients ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Appointment ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Adopted ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' illiterate ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' skills ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Measures ', ' Tooth Loss ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' health related quality of life ', ' care systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Navigation System ', ' Consent Forms ', ' Informed Consent Forms ', ' Informed Consent Documents ', ' Consent Documents ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2008,360985,0.030460067913505032
"Boundary Crossings: Re-Situating Cultural Competence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This 4 year longitudinal, urban, multi-method ethnographic study will examine cross cultural healthcare encounters. The study will identify, describe and situate how families contribute to the production of culturally responsive care and the strategies families and practitioners employ to establish commonality, bridge difference, and effectively ""partner up."" This is a continuation of Boundary Crossing: A Longitudinal and Ethnographic Study (R01 HD 38878, 2000-2004). It builds upon research conducted with a cohort of African American children with special health care needs, their primary caregivers, extended family networks, and the practitioners who serve them. Although there is an overwhelming body of literature confirming health care disparities for ethnic minorities, there is a striking paucity of strategies to address this significant public health issue. Much research on cultural competence radically underestimates how much work families do to achieve culturally competent care. Longitudinal and learning aspects are under-described, as are their strengths and resources families bring to healthcare encounters. The proposed research is both events centered and longitudinal. We will examine how discrete moments of healthcare encounters produce effects across both contexts and time, influencing developmental trajectories, family life, and health and therapeutic outcomes. The anticipated outcomes of this project are a description and interpretation of: 1) the knowledge and strategies families bring to shape encounters and generate desirable outcomes; 2) how families and practitioners revise their strategies; 3) how practitioners, family, and children develop and draw upon their history of shared endeavors; 4) how practitioners shape intervention to the unique needs and strengths of family and child; 5) how families and practitioners challenge and attempt to disconfirm stereotypes; and 6) the cultural resources practitioners and families draw upon. Findings that will result from this study will facilitate a reconsideration of dominant models of cultural competence and health literacy at multiple policy levels.

"Amelioration of Literacy Deficits in Prenatal Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The literacy challenges of the medical dialogue are considerable and significant; as these challenges fall within the relatively unexplored domains of conceptual and oral literacy, they have been all but ignored in the exponentially growing literacy literature. Nevertheless, it is in the oral and conceptual literacy domains that critical issues arise in face-to-face interactions with health providers. It is here that the frustration grows in the accomplishment of the most basic of patient goals- to understand and be understood. There is reason to believe that these challenges are especially evident for low-literate women seeking prenatal care. Despite evidence of persistent socioeconomic and racial disparity in prenatal, perinatal, and post-partum services utilization and health outcomes, there has been relatively little federal focus on setting goals for the amelioration of literacy and health communication deficits affecting pregnant and post-partum women and their babies (Healthy People 2010), or in designing literacy interventions to improve health outcomes for this population. It is in the first prenatal visit that significant cognitive and emotional challenges are likely to arise in the complex information needed to make an informed choice about prenatal testing and in facing the psychosocial and emotional challenges of pregnancy. Consequently, it is the first visit that is likely to set the stage forfeiture exchanges and determine the relationship that develops, and the array of attitudinal, psychological, behavioral, and health outcomes that derive from care. The specific aims of the study are: (1) To understand the relationships among print, conceptual and oral literacy dimensions and to investigate the communication characteristics of deficits in these realms; (2) To work collaboratively with low-literate women, and health literacy experts, to develop a communication intervention designed to: (a) ameliorate oral and conceptual literacy deficits related to informed choice regarding prenatal genetic testing and (b)to facilitate disclosure and discussion about sensitive emotional and psychosocial topics, and (3) to conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the effect of the intervention on a variety of outcomes including: interaction, understanding, satisfaction, prenatal care utilization, post-partum appointment keeping, antenatal and post-partum depression symptoms, and pre-term deliveries.

"JUSTA: Justice and Health for Poultry Workers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The overall goal of this project is to address the health disparities faced by immigrant Latino poultry workers in rural, western North Carolina (NC), through a partnership (JUSTA-Justice and Health for Poultry Workers) of community advocates, environmental health sciences, and health care providers.  Workers in the poultry industry in the U.S. experience a disproportionate share of occupation-attributed musculoskeletal, skin and respiratory disorders.  Recent trends in this industry have concentrated the injuries in a worker population that is poor, minority, and comprised predominantly of immigrants.  These workers are purposively recruited into jobs rejected by the local population, and lack the means to protect themselves from hazards.  The exposures of workers also affect their families.  To bring about greater social and environmental justice for these workers, the proposed work will have two loci:  helping individual workers and their families to be more resilient to stressors, strengthening community-based organizations so that they can move toward social and regulatory change and justice.  Community advocates, health care providers and environmental health researchers will work together in this project to address five Specific Aims:  1) to encourage social action by Latino community-based advocacy groups in western NC to effect policies that reduce the burden of occupational and environmental health disparities due to employment in the poultry industry; 2) to construct the foundation on which to base educational materials and communication strategies designed to prevent or reduce exposure to physical and social occupational stressors and their effects among Latino poultry worker families; 3) to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate educational materials and implement programs that will promote ways to prevent or reduce exposure to physical and social occupational stressors and their effects among Latino poultry worker families; 4) to develop educational materials and implement programs that will better prepare health care providers to recognize and treat with cultural competence illnesses related to poultry production and processing among immigrant families, and counsel families on ways to prevent or reduce exposure; and 5) to evaluate the process and outcomes of community participation in this project so that it can be used by other community-based organizations to engage community residents in efforts to reduce environmental and occupational risks in their own communities.

"Low Maternal Health Literacy: An Obstacle to Pediatric Health Care Utilitzation    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The aims of this proposed research are to:   1.) Determine the extent to which the children of mothers with low health literacy differ from the children of mothers without low health literacy in meeting established pediatric preventive care and immunization guidelines including the timing and number of well-child visits and receipt of vaccinations.   2.) Determine the extent to which predisposing, enabling, and need factors are associated with appropriate use of pediatric preventive care and adherence to immunization guidelines.   3.) Determine whether or to what extent maternal health literacy mediates the relationship between identified predisposing, enabling and needs factors and outcomes of appropriate use of pediatric preventive care and adherence to immunization guidelines   4.) Determine whether or to what extent maternal health literacy moderates the relationship between the identified predisposing, enabling and needs factors and the outcomes of appropriate use of pediatric preventive care and adherence to immunization guidelines.      We will compare mothers with and without low health literacy to identify any additional maternal factors, such as low socioeconomic status, reduced access and barriers to care, and health promotion understanding, that are differentially associated with maternal health literacy.   We plan to determine if maternal health literacy mediates the relationship between variables such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and underutilization of pediatric preventive care.      We will explore whether maternal health literacy moderates the relationship between factors such as race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, and preventive pediatric health care quality indicators.   Exploring the association between health literacy and the use of pediatric preventive care, as well the potential mediating and moderating effects of health literacy will allow us to gather information that will guide us in the development of targeted interventions.      We will examine a sample of low-income, inner city women who enrolled prenatally as participants in a series of linked observational studies, and completed surveys that assessed demographic and socioeconomic factors corresponding to factors of predisposing, enabling, and need.      We will evaluate the impact of health literacy on self-reported utilization of services. We will also link these data with Medicaid claims data in order to assess variations in adherence to recommendations for pediatric preventive care and adherence to immunization guidelines.      Using mixed quantitative and qualitative research methods in conjunction with primary and secondary data sources, provides a unique opportunity to address important gaps in the research literature and to evaluate the circumstances under which maternal literacy impacts pediatric preventive health care utilization and pediatric health outcomes in the ""real world"".       Examining the mediating and moderating influences of health literacy in the context of predisposing, enabling, and need factors will provide a foundation on which to identify specific at risk populations, and appropriately target health literacy interventions that have the potential to decrease disparities in utilization of pediatric healthcare in highly vulnerable populations.          ",Low Maternal Health Literacy: An Obstacle to Pediatric Health Care Utilitzation,7449350,R36HS017471,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R36,2008,33484,0.17293071469018664
"Literacy & Maternal Health; Defining Obstacles to Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This revised application for an NICHD Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) seeks support to develop a program of research related to social factors contributing to disparities in maternal-child health. In particular, I am interested in identifying obstacles to preventive pediatric care for preterm infants related to maternal low literacy. While low literacy is common in populations with high rates of preterm birth and has been associated with poor care utilization in other settings little to nothing is known about the role of literacy in the utilization of pediatric care. This research is designed to lay the groundwork for a community based intervention to reduce obstacles to effective pediatric care utilization faced by women with low literacy. The proposed course of study includes: 1) an educational component, and 2) a research plan to be carried out through three linked studies. Study 1 is an analysis of a prospective study of low income, inner-city women following a preterm birth (< 35 weeks gestation; n=700). The goal of this study is to examine the association between maternal literacy and preventive pediatric care (well child visits and Up to Date vaccination status) as well as to assess potential mediators of this association. Study 2, with the same population, will utilize qualitative methods to clarify factors identified in Study 1 and uncover new obstacles to care from the perspective of the mothers. Study 3 utilizes the findings of the preceding work to develop a community based intervention to modify the obstacles identified in Studies 1 and 2. A home visiting model used widely to deliver services to low income women and their infants will be adapted to include health and literacy instruction to address the identified obstacles to pediatric care utilization. The educational component focuses on specific areas of advanced social science methodology, statistical methods, and the assessment of adult literacy, as well as the design of intervention trials, which are needed for the planned research studies and subsequent independent research career. This work will result in an R01 intervention study proposal to be submitted in the fourth year. The proposed research represents a unique opportunity to study the role of low literacy and pediatric care utilization in a setting in which the benefits of effective utilization are clear and well defined. The results of this work will also have important implications for understanding the role of literacy in health care utilization for the larger group of term infants.              ",Literacy & Maternal Health; Defining Obstacles to Care,7409212,K23HD048915,"['Research Training ', ' Supplementation ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Infant Health ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' literacy ', ' satisfaction ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mothers ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Vaccination ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Week ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' size ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' Services ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' Budgets ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Case Management ', ' Mediating ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' health literacy ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' task analysis ', ' service utilization ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Range ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2008,132987,0.07775746761759104
"Health Literacy Intervention for Korean Americans with HPB    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the tremendous progress that has been made in improving heart health in the US population during the last decade, many ethnic minority populations are still experiencing significant health disparity gaps. In particular, low health literacy in populations with limited English skills has undoubtedly hindered the development of effective strategies for improving health outcomes and reducing health disparity gaps. This research application is formulated in response to the widely recognized need for health literacy promoting intervention. This research effort is designed to answer research questions that address critical knowledge gaps in the field of health literacy intervention for linguistically and/or socially isolated ethnic minority communities, using the Korean American community as an example. These questions include whether or not: 1) a health literacy-focused intervention using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process will be effective in promoting health literacy and achieving better HBP outcomes in a community that is known as one of the ""hard-to reach"" populations for clinical research; and (2) an intervention delivered by lay health workers (i.e., community health workers) teamed with registered nurses will be acceptable and effective in such a community. The proposed study is a community-based, randomized clinical trial with delayed intervention and a longitudinal repeated measures design that will allow us to determine the effectiveness of the proposed health literacy-focused HBP intervention. A total of 360 Korean American seniors will participate in this study over two- year period. While the focus of this research project is literacy promotion and HBP control in Korean American immigrant seniors, it is our belief that the core components of this intervention's principles and methodology can provide meaningful insights to other researchers who are seeking to develop effective, culturally sensitive health literacy programs to meet the needs of socially and/or linguistically isolated minority groups with HBP throughout the U.S.           ",Health Literacy Intervention for Korean Americans with HPB,7851623,R01HL085567,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart ', ' Area ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Information Services ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Language ', ' insight ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' literacy ', ' Literacy Programs ', ' Literature ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Glare ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Terminology ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Koreans ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social isolation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Washington ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Baltimore ', ' Belief ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' Korean American ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' member ', ' Registered nurse ', ' R.N.

"Influence of Health Literacy and Cancer among Rural Patients in Rehabilitation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy has emerged as an important construct because it's four components: cultural and conceptual knowledge, listening and speaking (oral literacy), writing and reading (print literacy), and numeracy affect the health outcomes of individuals. As individuals don't live in a vacuum, it is important to understand the complex interaction of health literacy at multiple levels of interaction from the individual to the family, health care system and community. Describing how these multiple points of view connect and influence each other for individuals with cancer and other chronic illnesses, from rural Appalachian communities who are in a rehabilitation setting is the under explored focus of this study. The current study is the first step in developing a program of research designed to address these complex interactions and gaps in the literature. Through in-depth interviews and focus groups, the goal of the present study is to explore the influence of health literacy from the individual, family, health care facility and the patient's rural home community point of view. We propose to achieve three specific aims: 1.) Describe the health literacy level of this population. 2.) Determine the supports and barriers found in an inpatient rehabilitation facility in terms of facilitating health communication and addressing potential health literacy issues. 3.) Address the impact of health literacy on the transition from a rehabilitation facility back to a person's rural home community. This descriptive pilot study is a critical first step toward our ultimate goal of developing and empirically assessing health literacy interventions for this population. Later inquiries will include an examination of current processes in a rehabilitation setting and how they positively or negatively support health communication particularly in terms of health literacy in rural populations. The long-term goal is to develop interventions that will decrease the barriers and enhance the supports in health communication to decrease poor health outcomes, decrease health disparities in rehabilitation and positively influence transitions between settings for individuals with cancer and other chronic disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Low health literacy has the potential to negatively impact individuals with cancer and other chronic illness who are in a rehabilitation setting in terms of health and well-being. Low health literacy can negatively impact issues such as self-management of cancer and other chronic illness and medication adherence. This problem is possibly compounded if the individual is from a rural community, transplanted to a metropolitan inpatient rehabilitation setting and then sent back to their rural community. It is important to understand how low health literacy interacts with the individual in their complex social setting, including family, health care setting and home community with the goal of reducing potential health disparities among this population.          ",Influence of Health Literacy and Cancer among Rural Patients in Rehabilitation,7559291,R03CA136444,"['Literature ', ' Rural ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Health Communication ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Process ', ' Family ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' Focus Groups ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Kentucky ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' literacy ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Printing ', ' Reading ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Rural Population ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Vacuum ', ' Writing ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Physical Function ', ' rehabilitation service ', ' metropolitan ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' Population Study ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' social ', ' falls ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Rural Community ', ' Self Management ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Client ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' health literacy ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R03,2009,89684,0.23170810264215827
"Click to Connect: Improving Health Literacy through Internet Literacy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health Literacy is defined as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions (US DHHS, 2000). Yet there is well-documented evidence for profound inequalities in the distribution of communications services, the digital divide, and advantages accruing from it thus threatening the normative goal of developing a health literate public. The research question guiding this project is: Does improving access to the Internet, and training in how to use the Internet for health information, among the socially disadvantaged lead to changes in health literacy, and secondarily in health knowledge and beliefs about health compared to a control group in usual care condition? We will recruit 258 subjects from adult education centers in Boston, the most diverse city in New England, and randomize them to either the intervention or control conditions. 129 subjects in the intervention group will be provided with free computers and high-speed Internet at home. They will also be provided with training on how to use computers and navigate the Internet, as well as a web portal that will help in the use of the Internet for one year. Intervention will occur in three waves with 43 subjects per wave per year. Baseline and post-Intervention data .will be gathered through a telephone survey of subjects in both groups and Internet and computer use will be tracked in the Intervention group. The data from this project will provide the necessary information to design future information architecture that can address health literacy and digital divide issues specific to the needs of the socially disadvantaged.           ",Click to Connect: Improving Health Literacy through Internet Literacy,7636902,R01CA122894,"['Control Groups ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' communication behavior ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Medical ', ' Information Services ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' post intervention ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' literacy ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Mass Media ', ' mass information media ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Patients ', ' Exposure to ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Social Class ', ' Knowledge ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Services ', ' Boston ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' literate ', ' Reporting ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Communication ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' shared decision making ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2009,552583,0.18246959464931023
"Amelioration of Literacy Deficits in Prenatal Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The literacy challenges of the medical dialogue are considerable and significant; as these challenges fall within the relatively unexplored domains of conceptual and oral literacy, they have been all but ignored in the exponentially growing literacy literature. Nevertheless, it is in the oral and conceptual literacy domains that critical issues arise in face-to-face interactions with health providers. It is here that the frustration grows in the accomplishment of the most basic of patient goals- to understand and be understood. There is reason to believe that these challenges are especially evident for low-literate women seeking prenatal care. Despite evidence of persistent socioeconomic and racial disparity in prenatal, perinatal, and post-partum services utilization and health outcomes, there has been relatively little federal focus on setting goals for the amelioration of literacy and health communication deficits affecting pregnant and post-partum women and their babies (Healthy People 2010), or in designing literacy interventions to improve health outcomes for this population. It is in the first prenatal visit that significant cognitive and emotional challenges are likely to arise in the complex information needed to make an informed choice about prenatal testing and in facing the psychosocial and emotional challenges of pregnancy. Consequently, it is the first visit that is likely to set the stage forfeiture exchanges and determine the relationship that develops, and the array of attitudinal, psychological, behavioral, and health outcomes that derive from care. The specific aims of the study are: (1) To understand the relationships among print, conceptual and oral literacy dimensions and to investigate the communication characteristics of deficits in these realms; (2) To work collaboratively with low-literate women, and health literacy experts, to develop a communication intervention designed to: (a) ameliorate oral and conceptual literacy deficits related to informed choice regarding prenatal genetic testing and (b)to facilitate disclosure and discussion about sensitive emotional and psychosocial topics, and (3) to conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the effect of the intervention on a variety of outcomes including: interaction, understanding, satisfaction, prenatal care utilization, post-partum appointment keeping, antenatal and post-partum depression symptoms, and pre-term deliveries.

"Examination of Oral Health Literacy in Public Health Practice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  According to the 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey, 25 percent of US adults are functionally illiterate. Because written health information is frequently provided at above the tenth grade level, health messages are not reaching low literacy patients jeopardizing their health status. Low literacy has been found by researchers to have a detrimental effect on general health and the use of medical services. Evidence from research in medical settings consistently highlights the importance of comprehension and literacy for patient compliance and increased positive health outcomes. Although much is known about medical health literacy, there are no studies that have systematically studied oral health literacy. The purpose of this current application is to examine how a low dental literacy population interprets dental health prevention information, navigates the dental health system and whether participation in a large comprehensive public health program (WIC) can be effective in improving this process for pregnant women and their children and reduce health disparities. Specifically, we will: 1) Determine the dental health literacy rates among a low income, high risk population, 2) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in understanding preventive dental health information such as consent forms, oral hygiene instructions and compliance to fluoride instructions among a low income/low dental health literacy population 3) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in navigating the .dental health care system among a low income/low dental literacy population including compliance for dental appointments and appropriate use and 4) Evaluate the effects of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program on cumulative treatment and costs of dental services provided by Medicaid as well as oral health related quality of life in a population with low dental health literacy.           ",Examination of Oral Health Literacy in Public Health Practice,7644511,R01DE018045,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Labeling ', ' Drug Product Labeling ', ' Drug Package Inserts ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Low income ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Process ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Comprehension ', ' Fluorides ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Gingivitis ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' working group ', ' Hospitals ', ' Medical ', ' Infant ', ' Dental ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Patients ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Appointment ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Adopted ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' illiterate ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' skills ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' tenth grade ', ' high school sophomore ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Measures ', ' Tooth Loss ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' health related quality of life ', ' care systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Navigation System ', ' high risk ', ' Consent Forms ', ' Informed Consent Forms ', ' Informed Consent Documents ', ' Consent Documents ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2009,356162,0.030460067913505032
"Worker Health and Safety Training Cooperative Agreement    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)      The Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC) formed by The Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union (PACE), the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and the Labor Institute (together representing over 875,000 industrial workers) will conduct over the next 5 years approximately 3,800 workshops reaching 86,000 workers and community residents with 900,000 hours of training to prevent hazardous substance emergencies and to protect workers and communities should such accidents occur. The model training will consist of courses that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120, address environmental justice and health disparities, and assist worker-trainer development and evaluation.  Specific Aims include to, 1) expand model site-based training, called ITS programs, to meld 1910.120-based training into broad, ongoing plant-wide prevention programs. The TMC will add 8 ITS programs per year (total of 40 new sites) to our existing 35 sites resulting in 72 total sites at the end of five years involving an estimated 30,000 workers and managers.  In addition, the goals are to, 2) pilot a new Near-miss Initiative working with the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center of the University of Pennsylvania; 3) conduct community/labor workshops with regional environmental justice networks and Latino workers; 4) expand the use of advanced training technologies including web-based lessons learned, e-learning and emergency response simulation programs; 5) use participatory research and evaluation to monitor and strengthen the program; and 6) lead a multi-grantee (seven unions) initiative to work together on trainer, curriculum and evaluation development.  With the HDPTP supplement the TMC will help protect workers and community residents from potential exposures to hazardous materials released during terrorist attacks on industrial facilities with large volumes of highly hazardous chemicals, specifically at the 306 Risk Management Program Sites (RMPs) at which PACE and USWA represent 75,000 workers.  The TMC will reach 19,700 participants with 192,360 contact hours of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) prevention, preparedness and response training.  The TMC will also recruit and train an entirely new, nation-wide, industrial catastrophic incident Prevention, Preparedness and Response (PPR) Corps composed of 68 experienced workers from RMP sites. The PPR Corps, consisting of credentialed industrial responders, will work with OSHA, and through OSHA, the DHS to assist in OSHA's Regional Emergency Response Plans for high hazard sites. The PPR Corps will train industrial site workers, management and community responders, as well as conduct facility audits to evaluate prevention activities, emergency preparedness, and readiness to create site safety plans in the event of a catastrophe.         ",Worker Health and Safety Training Cooperative Agreement,7920277,U45ES006175,"['Credentialing ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Ally ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Address ', ' weapons of mass destruction ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' International ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Hazardous Chemicals ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Health ', ' Site ', ' Institutes ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Americas ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Paper ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Plants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Risk Management ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Safety ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Accidents ', ' Communities ', ' Community Workers ', ' environmental justice ', ' ']",NIEHS,STEELWORKER CHARITABLE/EDUCATIONAL ORG,U45,2009,720250,0.06355940784346867
"Occupational Health Literacy, Socioeconomic Status & Work-related Injury to Teens    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study examines the relationship between health literacy as it applies to the workplace, i.e., ""occupational health literacy,"" and work-related injury, which affects nearly 230,000 U.S. adolescents under 18 every year. Since general health literacy is known to be associated with a variety of health outcomes and with socioeconomic status (SES), occupational health literacy is likely to be related to occupational health outcomes and to SES as well, yet no studies have explored this hypothesis. In this study, we will examine occupational health literacy as both a determinant of work-related injury (WRI) prevalence and as a mediating factor in the known association between SES and adolescent WRI. Exploring this novel concept of occupational health literacy will forge new ground in understanding the causes of adolescent work injury and the association between SES and WRI among adolescents. Our specific aims are to determine, 1) if low occupational health literacy is associated with higher work-related injury prevalence among youth, 2) if youth of lower SES have lower occupational health literacy, and 3) if low occupational health literacy among low SES youth mediates the association between low SES and elevated work-related injury prevalence. We will achieve these aims by taking advantage of a unique dataset containing information on 2,315 adolescent workers of varying levels of SES in five cities across the US. These data include work-related injury prevalence, several measures of SES and an array of variables used to measure occupational health literacy (e.g., access to health and safety information and demonstrated health and safety knowledge and skills). This combination of data is rare and provides an excellent opportunity to answer the research questions posed in this study. The main analytic technique used in this study will be regression modeling. The high prevalence of WRI in this sample precludes the use of logistic regression. Therefore, Cox regression models will be used to obtain prevalence ratios as was done in the previous study of the association between WRI and SES. This study addresses traumatic injury and occupational health disparities among young workers, all of which are emphasized in the National Occupational Research Agenda. Study findings will be useful in developing interventions to enhance occupational health literacy among working youth, with specific efforts targeted at improving literacy among disadvantaged youth, to reduce their disproportionate injury burden. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the role of ""occupational health literacy"" as both a determinant of work-related injury prevalence and as a mediating factor in the association between socioeconomic status and work-related injury among adolescents. Study findings will inform prevention efforts aimed at reducing the prevalence of adolescent work-related injury. They can also lead to intervention strategies that equalize occupational health literacy among youth, with specific efforts targeted at improving occupational health literacy among disadvantaged youth to reduce their disproportionate injury burden.          ","Occupational Health Literacy, Socioeconomic Status & Work-related Injury to Teens",8065698,R03OH009557,[''],NIOSH,WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY,R03,2009,58010,0.08836308688333172
"Determinants of Asian Immigrant Workers' Mental Health and Work Performance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for a K01 Mentored Career Development Award (PAR-04-105) for Dr. Tsai to develop expertise in theory-based multivariate model testing methods, population-based survey design, intervention research, and social determinants of occupational safety and health (OSH) disparities among Asian immigrant workers. Dr. Tsai is an Assistant Professor with well-honed qualitative research skills. Her immediate career goal is to facilitate her development as an independent researcher by acquiring new skills in advanced quantitative methods and refining her community-partnered research expertise in the area of Asian immigrant worker health and safety. Ultimately, this career development award will lead to a R01 proposal based on the research completed as the result of this proposed project. Dr. Tsai's longer-term career goals are to integrate these research findings into practice and policy for improved Asian immigrant worker health and to identify factors amenable to interventions that promote a healthier USAsian immigrant workforce. She will acquire new knowledge and skills through mentored research activities, selected coursework, participations in research seminars, and active participation in research dissemination through scientific presentations and publications. Traditionally, OSH research focuses on the effects of workplace physical, chemical, and biological hazards on workers' health and safety. To create a more comprehensive approach to promoting worker health and safety, social and workplace determinants of health need to be considered. The proposed research project includes two studies. Study 1 maximizes an opportunity to use the NIAAA/NIH Filipino American Community Epidemiological Study (fACES) to test the influence of social discrimination, job concerns, and social support on immigrant workers' mental health problems and substance use. Study 2 extends the investigation of these factors with a sample of Chinese immigrants. Importantly, Study 2 will investigate the added influence of workplace support, and work performance as a distal outcome mediated by mental health problems and substance use. The proposed project will generate knowledge for designing theory-driven preventive interventions for promoting health and safety among Chinese and Filipino immigrant workers, an underrepresented population in OSH research. Dr. Tsai will be mentored by Drs. Salazar and Thompson, two well-funded researchers at the University of Washington (UW), and she will have access to resources in this research-intenstive environment. Dr. Takeuchi, a US lead researcher in Asian immigrant and Asian American health and a Professor at the UW, will serve as consultant on Dr. Tsai's mentorship team. This award will secure sufficient research time for Dr. Tsai to expand her quantitative research skills and to build a solid base for launching her program of research.           ",Determinants of Asian Immigrant Workers' Mental Health and Work Performance,7643243,K01OH009308,[''],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2009,108000,0.01930761694118024

"Health Literacy Intervention for Korean Americans with HPB    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the tremendous progress that has been made in improving heart health in the US population during the last decade, many ethnic minority populations are still experiencing significant health disparity gaps. In particular, low health literacy in populations with limited English skills has undoubtedly hindered the development of effective strategies for improving health outcomes and reducing health disparity gaps. This research application is formulated in response to the widely recognized need for health literacy promoting intervention. This research effort is designed to answer research questions that address critical knowledge gaps in the field of health literacy intervention for linguistically and/or socially isolated ethnic minority communities, using the Korean American community as an example. These questions include whether or not: 1) a health literacy-focused intervention using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process will be effective in promoting health literacy and achieving better HBP outcomes in a community that is known as one of the ""hard-to reach"" populations for clinical research; and (2) an intervention delivered by lay health workers (i.e., community health workers) teamed with registered nurses will be acceptable and effective in such a community. The proposed study is a community-based, randomized clinical trial with delayed intervention and a longitudinal repeated measures design that will allow us to determine the effectiveness of the proposed health literacy-focused HBP intervention. A total of 360 Korean American seniors will participate in this study over two- year period. While the focus of this research project is literacy promotion and HBP control in Korean American immigrant seniors, it is our belief that the core components of this intervention's principles and methodology can provide meaningful insights to other researchers who are seeking to develop effective, culturally sensitive health literacy programs to meet the needs of socially and/or linguistically isolated minority groups with HBP throughout the U.S.           ",Health Literacy Intervention for Korean Americans with HPB,7670360,R01HL085567,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart ', ' Area ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Information Services ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Language ', ' insight ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' literacy ', ' Literacy Programs ', ' Literature ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Glare ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Terminology ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Koreans ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social isolation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Washington ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Baltimore ', ' Belief ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' Korean American ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' member ', ' Registered nurse ', ' R.N.

"An Automated, Tailored Information Application for Medication Health Literacy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is a critically important problem in improving the health outcomes in patients with HIV infection. Patient behaviors essential to the successful treatment of HIV infection, such as high levels of medication adherence, may depend on patients' understanding how to take medication, how to solve medication-related problems, and how to cope with medication side effects. Addressing the problem of low health literacy in individuals affected by HIV infection may thus be an important way of improving their health status. It is unclear, however, exactly how to improve health literacy in persons with HIV infection and the extent to which improving it might affect important variables such as medication adherence and health outcomes. A related problem in developing interventions to improve health literacy in any patient group is how to provide the intervention in a cost effective manner. Medical care for individuals with low levels of health literacy is often provided in clinics in limited-resource settings or in the offices of busy private practitioners who have little opportunity to provide or support for additional interventions. A promising strategy for providing health literacy interventions in busy or limited-resource setting is to provide them through automated computer-based applications. Information technology-based interventions to promote health literacy have the potential for being readily available on desktop computers or over the Internet. E-health applications may be an important strategy for addressing health disparities (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2006). Once created, costs for their continued maintenance and deployment can be low. They could thus be a cost-effective strategy for addressing health literacy issues in persons with HIV infection (Brown, Vanable, & Eriksen, 2008), but have not been widely developed or validated. As one group (Wolf et al., 2007a) has suggested, ""New advances in multimedia technology could be used to better disseminate patient education . . ."" (p. 259). The purpose of the study proposed in this application is to create a computer-based and automated application that will provide individually-tailored health literacy education to persons with HIV infection. After development this application will be tested with 100 persons currently on antiretroviral treatment who will be recruited from a local clinic. They will participate in three sessions at four week intervals during the study. The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed by examining participants' medication and disease-related knowledge and awareness of problem solving skills before and after the training intervention and four weeks later. Self-report and electronically-monitored adherence in the four weeks before and after the intervention will also be assessed. The outcome of this study will be an automated tailored information application to improve health literacy in those coping with HIV infection.

"Literacy- Compensatory Strategies and Resources of Older Latinos with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose an innovative project that will identify and examine the compensatory strategies and resources used by low literate and low health-literate Latino diabetes patients when faced with literacy-demanding healthcare-related tasks. By comparing strategies and resources of patients who, despite their limited literacy, have good diabetes control, to those who have poor control, we seek to identify and distinguish between effective and ineffective strategies. Moreover, we will explore how the strategies used, and the effectiveness of these strategies, are influenced by personal and healthcare resources. We will limit our study to older Latino patients who have type 2 diabetes because there is tremendous opportunity to improve the health of older Latinos with low literacy and diabetes. Our experienced interdisciplinary team will perform in-depth interviews with 120 older limited English proficient Spanish-speakers with diabetes, 60 of whom are illiterate and 60 of whom have some, but limited, health literacy skills (""low literate""). We will recruit all participants from an urban safety-net hospital. This study will be the critical initial exploratory phase needed to concentrate intervention-development efforts on approaches that complement, augment, or utilize successful strategies. Our research team will use this project's findings to (a) develop a larger survey to quantitatively assess for personal and health care characteristics that may influence the use and effectiveness of strategies and resources; and, (b) develop and empirically test patient-centered interventions to reduce health disparities for older illiterate and low-literate Spanish-speaking patients with diabetes and other comparable chronic illnesses. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will provide insight into literacy-compensatory strategies and resources used by Latino diabetes patients with low literacy and low health literacy. This insight will guide researchers in developing powerful patient-centered interventions that have a high potential for decreasing literacy-associated disparities in diabetes outcomes among Latinos.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will provide insight into literacy-compensatory strategies and resources used by Latino diabetes patients with low literacy and low health literacy.

"A Multifaceted Adaptive Testing Approach to Health Literacy in Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent changes in the healthcare system necessitate that health consumers and patients play a more active role in the management of their health. Older adults, in particular, face many challenges in today's health care environment in terms of the increased complexity of health care systems and the proliferation of health information from numerous and diverse sources. Health literacy skills are needed for communication with healthcare providers, reading and understanding health information, medication compliance, using medical devices and making decisions about treatment options. Health literacy is lower among people aged 7 65, especially ethnic minorities and those with lower socio-economic status. Current measures of health literacy are limited in scope and inadequate in diagnosing specific literacy-related problems. The overall objective of this study is to develop and validate a health literacy instrument for older adults employing state-of-art computer-adaptive testing methods and technology. The first aim is to develop a comprehensive framework for identifying and measuring the core competencies that older adult consumers need to understand, access and use health related information and services. Towards that end, we will engage in a series of formative research activities including a systematic review of existing measures, convening an expert panel on health literacy and performing a series of cognitive task analyses on health related activities (e.g., glucose testing). This will contribute to the development and implementation of conceptual knowledge and numeracy modules. The prototype modules will be implemented as adaptive tests based on measurement decision theory. A preliminary study with 15 older adults at varying levels of health literacy will be conducted to develop testing norms. The data will be analyzed by investigators and scrutinized by members of the expert panel. On that basis, we will revise the 2 modules and subject it to a larger validation study with 2 groups of older adults: 1) ages 60-74 and 2) 75-85. A primary strength of this application is that we are addressing an issue of considerable and growing importance using a theoretically-grounded framework that greatly expands the scope of health literacy assessment. A comprehensive health literacy framework as described in this application can be used to support research on health literacy, develop screening tools for clinicians and tailor health education materials for older adult adults at varying levels of literacy. Public Health Relevance: literacy problems exist to a large extent because health information and services systems are unfamiliar and complex, which makes their effective utilization difficult for most people, especially for older adults. We are proposing to develop a health literacy assessment tool based on a comprehensive framework. The tool has the potential to be used to support research on health literacy, develop screening tools for clinicians and tailor health education materials for older adult patients and consumers at varying levels of literacy.             ",A Multifaceted Adaptive Testing Approach to Health Literacy in Older Adults,7619093,R21NR010710,"['base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' systematic review ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Series ', ' Information Services ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' literacy ', ' Research Activity ', ' Measurement ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' tool ', ' Reading ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Knowledge ', ' Arts ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' empowered ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' validation studies ', ' literate ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Self Management ', ' Communication ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Theory ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Age ', ' ']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2009,245995,0.11370023186759637
"Literacy and maternal health: defining obstacles to care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This revised application for an NICHD Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) seeks support to develop a program of research related to social factors contributing to disparities in maternal-child health. In particular, I am interested in identifying obstacles to preventive pediatric care for preterm infants related to maternal low literacy. While low literacy is common in populations with high rates of preterm birth and has been associated with poor care utilization in other settings little to nothing is known about the role of literacy in the utilization of pediatric care. This research is designed to lay the groundwork for a community based intervention to reduce obstacles to effective pediatric care utilization faced by women with low literacy. The proposed course of study includes: 1) an educational component, and 2) a research plan to be carried out through three linked studies. Study 1 is an analysis of a prospective study of low income, inner-city women following a preterm birth (< 35 weeks gestation; n=700). The goal of this study is to examine the association between maternal literacy and preventive pediatric care (well child visits and Up to Date vaccination status) as well as to assess potential mediators of this association. Study 2, with the same population, will utilize qualitative methods to clarify factors identified in Study 1 and uncover new obstacles to care from the perspective of the mothers. Study 3 utilizes the findings of the preceding work to develop a community based intervention to modify the obstacles identified in Studies 1 and 2. A home visiting model used widely to deliver services to low income women and their infants will be adapted to include health and literacy instruction to address the identified obstacles to pediatric care utilization. The educational component focuses on specific areas of advanced social science methodology, statistical methods, and the assessment of adult literacy, as well as the design of intervention trials, which are needed for the planned research studies and subsequent independent research career. This work will result in an R01 intervention study proposal to be submitted in the fourth year. The proposed research represents a unique opportunity to study the role of low literacy and pediatric care utilization in a setting in which the benefits of effective utilization are clear and well defined. The results of this work will also have important implications for understanding the role of literacy in health care utilization for the larger group of term infants.              ",Literacy and maternal health: defining obstacles to care,7591597,K23HD048915,"['Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Training ', ' Supplementation ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Characteristics ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Infant Health ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' literacy ', ' satisfaction ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mothers ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Vaccination ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' Services ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' Budgets ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Case Management ', ' Mediating ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' health literacy ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' task analysis ', ' service utilization ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2009,132652,0.07775746761759104
"Diabetes Care in American Samoa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As type 2 diabetes prevalence increases in the United States, the burden of diabetes falls more on groups with greater barriers to care, such as language and cultural differences, and lower economic resources. Healthy People 2010 targeted diabetes as one of six diseases for the elimination of racial and ethnic health disparities. These disparities extend to the US Territory of American Samoa, where the proportion of adults >18 years with diabetes was 19.6% in 2002, compared to 6.4% of US adults. There have been no reported diabetes interventions in Samoans in the US. The overall purpose of this application is to translate recent advances in diabetes care into clinical practice for the American Samoan community by improving methods of health care delivery and improve methods of diabetes self management. We will use the community health worker model to test an expanded diabetes care model. Community health workers (CHW) have frequently been used to serve as ""bridges"" between health care services and patients in poor ethnic minority communities. CHW workers provide culturally appropriate health education and instrumental social support and facilitation, and even organization, of access to care, while also providing patient information to medical providers. We propose a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a CHW and primary-care coordinated intervention to provide outreach, education and support to 352 type 2 diabetes patients and their families in American Samoa. The outcomes at a one-year follow-up will include glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cardiovascular disease risk factors, diet and exercise behaviors, and adherence to diabetes care guidelines. The intervention builds upon best clinical practices for diabetes care by translating effective strategies to American Samoans. The translation of good diabetes care there may offer a model that is potentially replicable in other ethnic minority populations suffering the burden of diabetes.       ",Diabetes Care in American

"Surveillance of mortality and Morbidity in US workers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Race-ethnicity and socio-economic status health disparities in occupational health have not been extensively investigated. Although significantly under-reported, occupational disease and injury, and mortality represent a significant health impact on US workers and their families. However, the risks for this occupational mortality and morbidity are not evenly distributed. It appears that these risks disproportionately affect US workers from race-ethnicity subpopulations and from lower socio-economic class. The University of Miami NIOSH NHIS Research Group proposes to use their existing Study Database derived from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), augmented by newly released NHIS data, to explore issues of health disparities among US workers based on differences between race-ethnic and socio- economic classes. The augmented NHIS database of a representative sample of over 660,000 US workers will allow the exploration of morbidity and mortality differences between and within occupations by various race ethnic subpopulations and by socio-economic class. Based on their previous work, the Investigators propose to pursue more sophisticated theoretical models to evaluate pathways of occupational risk, and morbidity and mortality between and within occupational subgroups. The use of these models will allow the Investigators to assess the relationship between occupation, indicators of morbidity, and the risk of mortality, testing whether or not the mortality risks noted in worker subgroups are mediated by morbidity. In addition, the Investigators propose to use the new NHIS data and the additional statistical modeling to explore the issue of health disparities among US workers based on different socio-economic and race-ethnicity subpopulations. Finally, the Investigators propose to produce an additional interactive Monograph on Health Disparities and Occupation in US Workers that will be made available through the expanded Study Website www.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/niehs/niosh/). This study proposal satisfies at least 3 NIOSH research priority areas (NORA): Surveillance research methods with unique mortality and morbidity data on 1) the entire US workforce; 2) older, race-ethnic, lower socio-economic and gender-specific worker subpopulations; and 3) social and economic costs of workplace disease and injury.           ",Surveillance of mortality and Morbidity in US workers,7633313,R01OH003915,[''],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2009,306000,0.023891081014458082
"Refining Entertainment Education for Cancer Literacy in African American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The lack of health literacy in the United States represents a widespread and serious health threat (1). Entertainment Education (EE) embeds health information into entertaining narratives (2) and holds promise for increasing health literacy among large audiences. This study will investigate the effects of manipulating three narrative elements in audio soap operas that incorporate breast and colorectal cancer screening messages as EE recommends. Study participants will be African American women over 50 years old, an audience that has reported getting health information from soap operas (54) and for whom screening for these diseases is recommended (6). The research will be guided by the Transportation/Imagery Model (4) which theorizes that exposure to narratives changes health behavior and its determinants only when an audience member feels carried away or ""transported"" into a narrative world. We hypothesize that there will be higher scores on outcome measures among soap opera listeners than among members of a control group who listen to an expert interview. Among soap opera listeners, we expect higher levels of transportation when: (a) cancer screening messages are embeded in a central plot that involves main characters rather than in a subplot that deals with minor characters, (b) the narrative is a drama with a consistently serious tone instead of a comedy, and (c) the plot rewards the character for being screened with an immediately negative test result instead of with an eventually successful outcome of treatment that began early because of a positive screening result. When transportation scores increase, we predict increases in cancer literacy, other psychosocial screening determinants, intentions to seek information and screening, and actual information-seeking and screening behavior such as appointment- making. Formative research will guide the development of various versions of audio soap operas that will incorporate breast and colorectal screening messages. Then two randomized experiments will be conducted. Six hundred women will each hear one version of a soap opera in a small, face-to-face group. Participants will complete questionnaires immediately before and after exposure to the audiotape and one month later. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans have lower levels of health literacy compared to whites and African American women suffer negative breast and colorectal cancer disparities with regard to screening rates, late-stage diagnosis and death (8,9). The long-term objective of this study is to develop more effective ways to deliver health messages to and promote health literacy among African American women.

Since general health literacy is known to be associated with a variety of health outcomes and with socioeconomic status (SES), occupational health literacy is likely to be related to occupational health outcomes and to SES as well, yet no studies have explored this hypothesis. In this study, we will examine occupational health literacy as both a determinant of work-related injury (WRI) prevalence and as a mediating factor in the known association between SES and adolescent WRI. Exploring this novel concept of occupational health literacy will forge new ground in understanding the causes of adolescent work injury and the association between SES and WRI among adolescents. Our specific aims are to determine, 1) if low occupational health literacy is associated with higher work-related injury prevalence among youth, 2) if youth of lower SES have lower occupational health literacy, and 3) if low occupational health literacy among low SES youth mediates the association between low SES and elevated work-related injury prevalence. We will achieve these aims by taking advantage of a unique dataset containing information on 2,315 adolescent workers of varying levels of SES in five cities across the US. These data include work-related injury prevalence, several measures of SES and an array of variables used to measure occupational health literacy (e.g., access to health and safety information and demonstrated health and safety knowledge and skills). This combination of data is rare and provides an excellent opportunity to answer the research questions posed in this study. The main analytic technique used in this study will be regression modeling. The high prevalence of WRI in this sample precludes the use of logistic regression. Therefore, Cox regression models will be used to obtain prevalence ratios as was done in the previous study of the association between WRI and SES. This study addresses traumatic injury and occupational health disparities among young workers, all of which are emphasized in the National Occupational Research Agenda. Study findings will be useful in developing interventions to enhance occupational health literacy among working youth, with specific efforts targeted at improving literacy among disadvantaged youth, to reduce their disproportionate injury burden. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the role of ""occupational health literacy"" as both a determinant of work-related injury prevalence and as a mediating factor in the association between socioeconomic status and work-related injury among adolescents. Study findings will inform prevention efforts aimed at reducing the prevalence of adolescent work-related injury.

"Community Alliance for Research Empowering Social Change (C.A.R.E.S)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Public Health and Health Policy Research at Stony Brook University in collaboration with Literacy Suffolk Inc propose to develop a Community Alliance for Research Empowering Social Change (CARES). CARES will consist of an interdisciplinary team of researchers, community based organizations and community members working together to improve minority health and eliminate racial/ethnic health disparities on Long Island through health literacy and education. This initiative will be developed through the strategic alliances of the Graduate Program in Public Health, the Suffolk County Department of Health Services, and a coalition of community members. This unique consortium will provide the necessary infrastructure for community-based participatory research. Long Island is one of the most mature and affluent suburbs in the nation with a population of approximately 3 million people. However, it is also considered the most segregated suburb in the nation, leaving its low-income residents vulnerable to poor health outcomes. Due Long Island's affluence and historical institutionalized housing practices, neighborhoods with high poverty rates are also communities of color. Utilizing community based participatory methods; we will examine the social and behavioral risk factors for racial/ethnic minorities on Long Island. Specifically, we will examine the chronic illnesses that disproportionately impact minority populations; work with our community coalition to develop and implement culturally competent evidence-based interventions; and disseminate those findings to our community members. The Center for Public Health and Health Policy Research strives to bridge the gap between community and research. Literacy Suffolk, Inc. believes that the ability to read, write, and communicate effectively is critical to personal freedom and the maintenance of a democratic society. Through CARES we will utilize the existing resources and social networks of our communities to encourage minorities to participate in research, in order to improve minority health outcomes on Long Island as well as empower our communities to participate in social change.          ",Community Alliance for Research Empowering Social Change (C.A.R.E.S),7692185,R03HD061220,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Social Network ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Policy Research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Behavioral ', ' Foundations ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' base ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' minority health ', ' Housing ', ' Left ', ' Phase ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' insight ', ' Trust ', ' literacy ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Collaborations ', ' Political Factor ', ' Poverty ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Societies ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Belief ', ' empowered ', ' member ', ' social ', ' County ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Research Ethics Committees ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' health literacy ', ' forging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Long Island ', ' community based participatory research ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' ']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R03,2009,31500,0.05133920640406748
"An Automated, Tailored Information Application for Medication Health Literacy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is a critically important problem in improving the health outcomes in patients with HIV infection. Patient behaviors essential to the successful treatment of HIV infection, such as high levels of medication adherence, may depend on patients' understanding how to take medication, how to solve medication-related problems, and how to cope with medication side effects. Addressing the problem of low health literacy in individuals affected by HIV infection may thus be an important way of improving their health status. It is unclear, however, exactly how to improve health literacy in persons with HIV infection and the extent to which improving it might affect important variables such as medication adherence and health outcomes. A related problem in developing interventions to improve health literacy in any patient group is how to provide the intervention in a cost effective manner. Medical care for individuals with low levels of health literacy is often provided in clinics in limited-resource settings or in the offices of busy private practitioners who have little opportunity to provide or support for additional interventions. A promising strategy for providing health literacy interventions in busy or limited-resource setting is to provide them through automated computer-based applications. Information technology-based interventions to promote health literacy have the potential for being readily available on desktop computers or over the Internet. E-health applications may be an important strategy for addressing health disparities (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2006). Once created, costs for their continued maintenance and deployment can be low. They could thus be a cost-effective strategy for addressing health literacy issues in persons with HIV infection (Brown, Vanable, & Eriksen, 2008), but have not been widely developed or validated. As one group (Wolf et al., 2007a) has suggested, ""New advances in multimedia technology could be used to better disseminate patient education . . ."" (p. 259). The purpose of the study proposed in this application is to create a computer-based and automated application that will provide individually-tailored health literacy education to persons with HIV infection. After development this application will be tested with 100 persons currently on antiretroviral treatment who will be recruited from a local clinic. They will participate in three sessions at four week intervals during the study. The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed by examining participants' medication and disease-related knowledge and awareness of problem solving skills before and after the training intervention and four weeks later. Self-report and electronically-monitored adherence in the four weeks before and after the intervention will also be assessed. The outcome of this study will be an automated tailored information application to improve health literacy in those coping with HIV infection.

"Refining Entertainment Education for Cancer Literacy in African American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The lack of health literacy in the United States represents a widespread and serious health threat (1). Entertainment Education (EE) embeds health information into entertaining narratives (2) and holds promise for increasing health literacy among large audiences. This study will investigate the effects of manipulating three narrative elements in audio soap operas that incorporate breast and colorectal cancer screening messages as EE recommends. Study participants will be African American women over 50 years old, an audience that has reported getting health information from soap operas (54) and for whom screening for these diseases is recommended (6). The research will be guided by the Transportation/Imagery Model (4) which theorizes that exposure to narratives changes health behavior and its determinants only when an audience member feels carried away or ""transported"" into a narrative world. We hypothesize that there will be higher scores on outcome measures among soap opera listeners than among members of a control group who listen to an expert interview. Among soap opera listeners, we expect higher levels of transportation when: (a) cancer screening messages are embeded in a central plot that involves main characters rather than in a subplot that deals with minor characters, (b) the narrative is a drama with a consistently serious tone instead of a comedy, and (c) the plot rewards the character for being screened with an immediately negative test result instead of with an eventually successful outcome of treatment that began early because of a positive screening result. When transportation scores increase, we predict increases in cancer literacy, other psychosocial screening determinants, intentions to seek information and screening, and actual information-seeking and screening behavior such as appointment- making. Formative research will guide the development of various versions of audio soap operas that will incorporate breast and colorectal screening messages. Then two randomized experiments will be conducted. Six hundred women will each hear one version of a soap opera in a small, face-to-face group. Participants will complete questionnaires immediately before and after exposure to the audiotape and one month later. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans have lower levels of health literacy compared to whites and African American women suffer negative breast and colorectal cancer disparities with regard to screening rates, late-stage diagnosis and death (8,9). The long-term objective of this study is to develop more effective ways to deliver health messages to and promote health literacy among African American women. The public health relevance of such knowledge lies in its potential to decrease health disparities in a significant minority population.          ",Refining Entertainment Education for Cancer Literacy in African American Women,7751266,R01CA129420,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Drama ', ' Positive Test Result ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Screening Result ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Indium ', ' In element ', ' Information Services ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' literacy ', ' Mails ', ' Minor ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Rewards ', ' Appointment ', ' Soaps ', ' Knowledge ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Audiotape ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' Test Result ', ' Behavior ', ' psychosocial ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Breast ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer education ', ' Communication ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NCI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,293779,0.10411962130597079

"Click to Connect: Improving Health Literacy through Internet Literacy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health Literacy is defined as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions (US DHHS, 2000). Yet there is well-documented evidence for profound inequalities in the distribution of communications services, the digital divide, and advantages accruing from it thus threatening the normative goal of developing a health literate public. The research question guiding this project is: Does improving access to the Internet, and training in how to use the Internet for health information, among the socially disadvantaged lead to changes in health literacy, and secondarily in health knowledge and beliefs about health compared to a control group in usual care condition? We will recruit 258 subjects from adult education centers in Boston, the most diverse city in New England, and randomize them to either the intervention or control conditions. 129 subjects in the intervention group will be provided with free computers and high-speed Internet at home. They will also be provided with training on how to use computers and navigate the Internet, as well as a web portal that will help in the use of the Internet for one year. Intervention will occur in three waves with 43 subjects per wave per year. Baseline and post-Intervention data .will be gathered through a telephone survey of subjects in both groups and Internet and computer use will be tracked in the Intervention group.

"Literacy- Compensatory Strategies and Resources of Older Latinos with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose an innovative project that will identify and examine the compensatory strategies and resources used by low literate and low health-literate Latino diabetes patients when faced with literacy-demanding healthcare-related tasks. By comparing strategies and resources of patients who, despite their limited literacy, have good diabetes control, to those who have poor control, we seek to identify and distinguish between effective and ineffective strategies. Moreover, we will explore how the strategies used, and the effectiveness of these strategies, are influenced by personal and healthcare resources. We will limit our study to older Latino patients who have type 2 diabetes because there is tremendous opportunity to improve the health of older Latinos with low literacy and diabetes. Our experienced interdisciplinary team will perform in-depth interviews with 120 older limited English proficient Spanish-speakers with diabetes, 60 of whom are illiterate and 60 of whom have some, but limited, health literacy skills (""low literate""). We will recruit all participants from an urban safety-net hospital. This study will be the critical initial exploratory phase needed to concentrate intervention-development efforts on approaches that complement, augment, or utilize successful strategies. Our research team will use this project's findings to (a) develop a larger survey to quantitatively assess for personal and health care characteristics that may influence the use and effectiveness of strategies and resources; and, (b) develop and empirically test patient-centered interventions to reduce health disparities for older illiterate and low-literate Spanish-speaking patients with diabetes and other comparable chronic illnesses.

"Developing Evidence-Based Guidelines for Patient-Accessible Medical Record    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health information tools for patients, including patient-accessible Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and Personal Health Records (PHRs) are proliferating in both large and small practices and health care delivery systems nationally and this will surely accelerate due to the Obama Administration's commitment to eHealth. Given that 50% of the adult population reads at the 8th grade level and lower, and millions of adults have low or inadequate health literacy, we can assume that many aspects of these systems are ""high-barrier"" and hard to read and use. However, there has been very limited systematic end-user assessment of these systems with low-literacy patients.        This proposed exploratory R21 research is being done in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene which is promoting the adoption of a patient-accessible EMR primarily among providers who care for underserved patients. Our target population is adults who are low income, low-education level, low-literacy, predominantly minority adults living in Harlem, NYC. The targeted health domain will be cancer prevention and management.       Aim 1: conduct patient-centered research on a representative sample of patient-accessible EMRs with a focus on three core functions: 1) Medication Management, 2) Lab/Test Results, and 3) Health Maintenance (e.g., reminders for screenings). Our research will be based on a user-centered design approach including: health literacy load analysis; focus groups; task analysis; and usability testing. We will perform these analyses of these core functions using a sample of patient-accessible EMRs that are in wide-spread use in the United States and vary in structure and interface design. Aim 1(a): understand patients' perceptions of the perceived utility of EMRs and the specific functions associated with these systems, and identify factors that influence patients' acceptance of these systems. In addition, we will gather information on patients' concerns about the adoption of EMRs.       Aim 2: develop preliminary guidelines for content, design, testing, and introducing patient-accessible EMRs for underserved and at-risk populations that can be evaluated in a future larger-scale effectiveness study. The preliminary guidelines that result from the proposed research will also be useful to public health officials working to adopt patient-accessible EMRs, provider practices and hospitals, and software developers. Our long term goal is to demonstrate in a comparative trial that EMRs that are informed by a rich model of health literacy and usability principles will result in better patient understanding and use of these systems and improvements in health status.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to study, and develop preliminary guidelines for, the readability and usability of patient-accessible electronic medical records (EMRs) by low average and low literacy patients, a topic about which little is known. This project is particularly timely, both because of the Obama Administration's commitment to eHealth and because the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, as part of a $27 million Mayoral initiative to improve the quality and efficiency of health care in New York City, is supporting the adoption of a patient-accessible EMR primarily among providers who care for patients who live in neighborhoods of great health disparities, which have a disproportionate number of low literacy patients. Our target population is adults who are low-medium income, low-educated, low-literate predominantly minority urban dwellers residing in Harlem, New York City.           Project Narrative We propose to study, and develop preliminary guidelines for, the readability and usability of patient-accessible electronic medical records (EMRs) by low average and low literacy patients, a topic about which little is known.

"Health Literacy Intervention for Korean Americans with HPB    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the tremendous progress that has been made in improving heart health in the US population during the last decade, many ethnic minority populations are still experiencing significant health disparity gaps. In particular, low health literacy in populations with limited English skills has undoubtedly hindered the development of effective strategies for improving health outcomes and reducing health disparity gaps. This research application is formulated in response to the widely recognized need for health literacy promoting intervention. This research effort is designed to answer research questions that address critical knowledge gaps in the field of health literacy intervention for linguistically and/or socially isolated ethnic minority communities, using the Korean American community as an example. These questions include whether or not: 1) a health literacy-focused intervention using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process will be effective in promoting health literacy and achieving better HBP outcomes in a community that is known as one of the ""hard-to reach"" populations for clinical research; and (2) an intervention delivered by lay health workers (i.e., community health workers) teamed with registered nurses will be acceptable and effective in such a community. The proposed study is a community-based, randomized clinical trial with delayed intervention and a longitudinal repeated measures design that will allow us to determine the effectiveness of the proposed health literacy-focused HBP intervention. A total of 360 Korean American seniors will participate in this study over two- year period. While the focus of this research project is literacy promotion and HBP control in Korean American immigrant seniors, it is our belief that the core components of this intervention's principles and methodology can provide meaningful insights to other researchers who are seeking to develop effective, culturally sensitive health literacy programs to meet the needs of socially and/or linguistically isolated minority groups with HBP throughout the U.S.           ",Health Literacy Intervention for Korean Americans with HPB,7922044,R01HL085567,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart ', ' Area ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Information Services ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Language ', ' insight ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' literacy ', ' Literacy Programs ', ' Literature ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Glare ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Terminology ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Koreans ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social isolation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Washington ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Baltimore ', ' Belief ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' Korean American ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' member ', ' Registered nurse ', ' R.N.

"Diabetes Care in American Samoa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As type 2 diabetes prevalence increases in the United States, the burden of diabetes falls more on groups with greater barriers to care, such as language and cultural differences, and lower economic resources. Healthy People 2010 targeted diabetes as one of six diseases for the elimination of racial and ethnic health disparities. These disparities extend to the US Territory of American Samoa, where the proportion of adults >18 years with diabetes was 19.6% in 2002, compared to 6.4% of US adults. There have been no reported diabetes interventions in Samoans in the US. The overall purpose of this application is to translate recent advances in diabetes care into clinical practice for the American Samoan community by improving methods of health care delivery and improve methods of diabetes self management. We will use the community health worker model to test an expanded diabetes care model. Community health workers (CHW) have frequently been used to serve as ""bridges"" between health care services and patients in poor ethnic minority communities. CHW workers provide culturally appropriate health education and instrumental social support and facilitation, and even organization, of access to care, while also providing patient information to medical providers. We propose a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a CHW and primary-care coordinated intervention to provide outreach, education and support to 352 type 2 diabetes patients and their families in American Samoa. The outcomes at a one-year follow-up will include glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cardiovascular disease risk factors, diet and exercise behaviors, and adherence to diabetes care guidelines. The intervention builds upon best clinical practices for diabetes care by translating effective strategies to American Samoans. The translation of good diabetes care there may offer a model that is potentially replicable in other ethnic minority populations suffering the burden of diabetes.

"Examination of Oral Health Literacy in Public Health Practice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  According to the 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey, 25 percent of US adults are functionally illiterate. Because written health information is frequently provided at above the tenth grade level, health messages are not reaching low literacy patients jeopardizing their health status. Low literacy has been found by researchers to have a detrimental effect on general health and the use of medical services. Evidence from research in medical settings consistently highlights the importance of comprehension and literacy for patient compliance and increased positive health outcomes. Although much is known about medical health literacy, there are no studies that have systematically studied oral health literacy. The purpose of this current application is to examine how a low dental literacy population interprets dental health prevention information, navigates the dental health system and whether participation in a large comprehensive public health program (WIC) can be effective in improving this process for pregnant women and their children and reduce health disparities. Specifically, we will: 1) Determine the dental health literacy rates among a low income, high risk population, 2) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in understanding preventive dental health information such as consent forms, oral hygiene instructions and compliance to fluoride instructions among a low income/low dental health literacy population 3) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in navigating the .dental health care system among a low income/low dental literacy population including compliance for dental appointments and appropriate use and 4) Evaluate the effects of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program on cumulative treatment and costs of dental services provided by Medicaid as well as oral health related quality of life in a population with low dental health literacy.           ",Examination of Oral Health Literacy in Public Health Practice,7868014,R01DE018045,"['Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' health related quality of life ', ' care systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Navigation System ', ' high risk ', ' Consent Forms ', ' Informed Consent Forms ', ' Informed Consent Documents ', ' Consent Documents ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Low income ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Process ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Comprehension ', ' Fluorides ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Gingivitis ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' working group ', ' Hospitals ', ' Medical ', ' Infant ', ' Dental ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Patients ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Appointment ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Adopted ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' illiterate ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' skills ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' tenth grade ', ' high school sophomore ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Measures ', ' Tooth Loss ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2010,352458,0.030460067913505032
"PlainLanguageRx: Improving Medication Labels to Reduce Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Summary  Overall, 36% of adult Americans, and 66% of Latinos, lack the level of health literacy needed to understand prescription drug information, such as the dosing instructions on medication container labels. Low health literacy and poor understanding of medication instructions are important contributors to health disparities. They lead to medication non-adherence, lack of chronic disease control, and excess health care utilization and costs.  Interventions to enhance the content and format of prescription drug labels could improve medication management and reduce health disparities, particularly among patients with low health literacy or limited English proficiency. A recent Institute of Medicine report highlighted the importance of standardizing medication labels according to available evidence. However, few if any tools have been developed to create and print evidence-based labels, or to accurately translate simplified dosing instructions into other languages.  This proposal seeks to develop and evaluate PlainLanguageRx, an innovative technology platform that will enable pharmacists to rapidly produce evidence-based medication container labels in English or Spanish. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Finalize the design of a clearly-formatted, evidence-based medication container label, known as PlainLanguageRx; 2) Develop the PlainLanguageRx software platform that will allow pharmacists to rapidly create evidence-based medication container labels; and 3) Conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of PlainLanguageRx labels, compared to traditional medication labels, on patients' understanding of their medication dosing instructions.  The project team consists of experienced software engineers and academic physicians with expertise in business development and clinical research among underserved populations. For Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups and interviews with English- and Spanish-speaking patients, pharmacists, and leading national experts who have agreed to serve as key informants and guide the final label design. In Aim 2, we will develop the PlainLanguageRx software platform and conduct user testing with pharmacists and pharmacy staff to optimize its usability, efficiency, and acceptability. For Aim 3, we will conduct a randomized trial of 400 patients who fill prescriptions at an academically-affiliated community pharmacy. Patients in the intervention group will receive their medications with PlainLanguageRx labels, while those in the control group will receive usual care. The study will evaluate the effect of the PlainLanguageRx labels on patients' understanding of their medication regimen (primary outcome), as well as their self-reported adherence and satisfaction (secondary outcomes).  Through a process of development and evaluation that is focused on the needs of both patients and pharmacists, our goal is to produce a software platform that facilitates the rapid creation of evidence-based labels and improves patients' understanding of their medication instructions. This will set the stage for subsequent efforts to disseminate this technology as a strategy to reduce health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance According to an Institute of Medicine report, prescription drug information in the United States is overly complex and is misunderstood by many Americans, particularly those with low health literacy or limited English proficiency. This proposal seeks to develop and evaluate PlainLanguageRx, an innovative and affordable technology that will enable pharmacists and pharmacy staff to rapidly create clearly-formatted, evidence-based prescription drug labels in English or Spanish. By helping patients better understand and adhere to medication instructions, this technology has potential to improve disease control and reduce health disparities among groups with low health literacy or limited English proficiency.           Relevance According to an Institute of Medicine report, prescription drug information in the United States is overly complex and is misunderstood by many Americans, particularly those with low health literacy or limited English proficiency.

The model training will consist of courses that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120, address environmental justice and health disparities, and assist worker-trainer development and evaluation.  Specific Aims include to, 1) expand model site-based training, called ITS programs, to meld 1910.120-based training into broad, ongoing plant-wide prevention programs. The TMC will add 8 ITS programs per year (total of 40 new sites) to our existing 35 sites resulting in 72 total sites at the end of five years involving an estimated 30,000 workers and managers.  In addition, the goals are to, 2) pilot a new Near-miss Initiative working with the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center of the University of Pennsylvania; 3) conduct community/labor workshops with regional environmental justice networks and Latino workers; 4) expand the use of advanced training technologies including web-based lessons learned, e-learning and emergency response simulation programs; 5) use participatory research and evaluation to monitor and strengthen the program; and 6) lead a multi-grantee (seven unions) initiative to work together on trainer, curriculum and evaluation development.  With the HDPTP supplement the TMC will help protect workers and community residents from potential exposures to hazardous materials released during terrorist attacks on industrial facilities with large volumes of highly hazardous chemicals, specifically at the 306 Risk Management Program Sites (RMPs) at which PACE and USWA represent 75,000 workers.  The TMC will reach 19,700 participants with 192,360 contact hours of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) prevention, preparedness and response training.  The TMC will also recruit and train an entirely new, nation-wide, industrial catastrophic incident Prevention, Preparedness and Response (PPR) Corps composed of 68 experienced workers from RMP sites. The PPR Corps, consisting of credentialed industrial responders, will work with OSHA, and through OSHA, the DHS to assist in OSHA's Regional Emergency Response Plans for high hazard sites. The PPR Corps will train industrial site workers, management and community responders, as well as conduct facility audits to evaluate prevention activities, emergency preparedness, and readiness to create site safety plans in the event of a catastrophe.         ",Worker Health and Safety Training Cooperative Agreement,8118364,U45ES006175,[''],NIEHS,STEELWORKER CHARITABLE/EDUCATIONAL ORG,U45,2010,39960,0.06355940784346867
"Determinants of Asian Immigrant Workers' Mental Health and Work Performance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for a K01 Mentored Career Development Award (PAR-04-105) for Dr. Tsai to develop expertise in theory-based multivariate model testing methods, population-based survey design, intervention research, and social determinants of occupational safety and health (OSH) disparities among Asian immigrant workers. Dr. Tsai is an Assistant Professor with well-honed qualitative research skills. Her immediate career goal is to facilitate her development as an independent researcher by acquiring new skills in advanced quantitative methods and refining her community-partnered research expertise in the area of Asian immigrant worker health and safety. Ultimately, this career development award will lead to a R01 proposal based on the research completed as the result of this proposed project. Dr. Tsai's longer-term career goals are to integrate these research findings into practice and policy for improved Asian immigrant worker health and to identify factors amenable to interventions that promote a healthier USAsian immigrant workforce. She will acquire new knowledge and skills through mentored research activities, selected coursework, participations in research seminars, and active participation in research dissemination through scientific presentations and publications. Traditionally, OSH research focuses on the effects of workplace physical, chemical, and biological hazards on workers' health and safety. To create a more comprehensive approach to promoting worker health and safety, social and workplace determinants of health need to be considered. The proposed research project includes two studies. Study 1 maximizes an opportunity to use the NIAAA/NIH Filipino American Community Epidemiological Study (fACES) to test the influence of social discrimination, job concerns, and social support on immigrant workers' mental health problems and substance use. Study 2 extends the investigation of these factors with a sample of Chinese immigrants. Importantly, Study 2 will investigate the added influence of workplace support, and work performance as a distal outcome mediated by mental health problems and substance use. The proposed project will generate knowledge for designing theory-driven preventive interventions for promoting health and safety among Chinese and Filipino immigrant workers, an underrepresented population in OSH research. Dr. Tsai will be mentored by Drs. Salazar and Thompson, two well-funded researchers at the University of Washington (UW), and she will have access to resources in this research-intenstive environment. Dr. Takeuchi, a US lead researcher in Asian immigrant and Asian American health and a Professor at the UW, will serve as consultant on Dr. Tsai's mentorship team. This award will secure sufficient research time for Dr. Tsai to expand her quantitative research skills and to build a solid base for launching her program of research.           ",Determinants of Asian Immigrant Workers' Mental Health and Work Performance,7848159,K01OH009308,[''],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2010,108000,0.01930761694118024
"Lower Washington Heights CBPR Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The specific aims of this research project are to improve health outcomes and decrease health disparities in the predominantly Latino/African American neighborhood of Washington Heights, located in Northern Manhattan. We propose to do this by building upon existing relationships among community organizations, New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University and by planning Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) that will utilize feedback from active community leaders so that we may jointly identify the most meaningful healthcare research priorities for the population of Washington Heights. This will be the beginning of a long-term CBPR agenda that includes assessing and measuring the outcome of current and future interventions that will be developed with active community participation. Living with the problems of poor healthcare outcomes, the community itself has earlier attempted to address the issues by forming strong collaborative partnerships among community organizations and with the neighboring Hospital and University. Through one such collaboration, the one upon which we wish to build this project, a coalition is currently changing the Washington Heights community in profound ways. This working partnership, known as the Health Academy Partnership Advisory Board, has already opened a health-oriented middle and high school called the Community Health Academy of the Heights, established in close proximity to New York Presbyterian. We propose to work with that Partnership Advisory Board to build the trusting relationships, organizational structures, and operational norms required to develop and sustain Community Based Participatory Research partnerships. At the end of the three year project, the partnership will have the capability, capacity and unity to successfully apply for research funding. Aim 1: Improve health literacy and information dissemination in Washington Heights by establishing a CBPR Partnership Advisory Board that will provide a structure for conducting CBPR projects that will improve health literacy and information dissemination. Aim 2: Develop an MOU between the New York Presbyterian Hospital (applicant organization), Columbia University, the Community League of the Heights, and the Community Health Academy of the Heights for the purpose of carrying out a CBPR project on health literacy and information dissemination. Aim 3: Provide a forum for community outreach by conducting at least 5 stakeholder focus groups and three open community forums that will identify the community's interest in addressing disparities in health and that will educate the community about health disparity conditions, health resources and the role of the CPBR Partnership in helping to remediate such disparities. Aim 4: In addition, we aim to design and create funding proposals for such research and for further interventions based on CBPR analyses and outcomes assessments. Our hypothesis is that a strong pre-existing partnership of invested community organizations aligned with a research team based at the institutions surrounding the catchment area, and the use of Community Based Participatory Research can coalesce as an effective tool for change - both locally and, by extension, nationally.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our hypothesis is that a strong pre-existing partnership of invested community organizations aligned with a research team based at the institutions surrounding the catchment area, and the use of Community Based Participatory Research can coalesce as an effective tool for change - both locally and, by extension, nationally.            Our hypothesis is that a strong pre-existing partnership of invested community organizations aligned with a research team based at the institutions surrounding the catchment area, and the use of Community Based Participatory Research can coalesce as an effective tool for change - both locally and, by extension, nationally.",Lower Washington Heights CBPR Partnership,7801557,U13HD063194,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Community Health ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Presbyterian Church ', ' Presbyterians ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Height ', ' interest ', ' high school ', ' Structure ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Outcome Assessment (Health Care) ', ' Outcomes Assessment ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Academy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,NEW YORK-PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL,U13,2010,30000,0.025895627666441316
"Surveillance of mortality and Morbidity in US workers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Race-ethnicity and socio-economic status health disparities in occupational health have not been extensively investigated. Although significantly under-reported, occupational disease and injury, and mortality represent a significant health impact on US workers and their families. However, the risks for this occupational mortality and morbidity are not evenly distributed. It appears that these risks disproportionately affect US workers from race-ethnicity subpopulations and from lower socio-economic class. The University of Miami NIOSH NHIS Research Group proposes to use their existing Study Database derived from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), augmented by newly released NHIS data, to explore issues of health disparities among US workers based on differences between race-ethnic and socio- economic classes. The augmented NHIS database of a representative sample of over 660,000 US workers will allow the exploration of morbidity and mortality differences between and within occupations by various race ethnic subpopulations and by socio-economic class. Based on their previous work, the Investigators propose to pursue more sophisticated theoretical models to evaluate pathways of occupational risk, and morbidity and mortality between and within occupational subgroups. The use of these models will allow the Investigators to assess the relationship between occupation, indicators of morbidity, and the risk of mortality, testing whether or not the mortality risks noted in worker subgroups are mediated by morbidity. In addition, the Investigators propose to use the new NHIS data and the additional statistical modeling to explore the issue of health disparities among US workers based on different socio-economic and race-ethnicity subpopulations. Finally, the Investigators propose to produce an additional interactive Monograph on Health Disparities and Occupation in US Workers that will be made available through the expanded Study Website www.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/niehs/niosh/). This study proposal satisfies at least 3 NIOSH research priority areas (NORA): Surveillance research methods with unique mortality and morbidity data on 1) the entire US workforce; 2) older, race-ethnic, lower socio-economic and gender-specific worker subpopulations; and 3) social and economic costs of workplace disease and injury.           ",Surveillance of mortality and Morbidity in US workers,7860311,R01OH003915,[''],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2010,344250,0.023891081014458082
"Health Literacy among Deaf ASL Users and Cardiovascular Health Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Michael McKee, MD is a deaf family physician whose career is centered on healthcare for deaf individuals who communicate in American Sign Language (ASL). Deaf ASL users are considered to be a linguistic minority group that is medically underserved with barriers and characteristics similar to what is found among many other linguistic minority groups. This group is also largely understudied which prevents progress in the Healthy People 2010's goals to reduce health disparities among minorities and disabled persons.  Dr. McKee's goal is to become a leading expert and an independent investigator on the topic of health literacy among linguistic minority populations. He is most interested in studying the impact of poor health literacy on cardiovascular disease among Deaf ASL users. The unique environment of the CDC-funded Preventive Research Center: National Center for Deaf Health Research (NCDHR) at the University of Rochester provides a very ideal place for Dr. McKee to accomplish that mission.  Rochester, New York, has been anecdotally reported to have the highest per capita deaf population in the United States. The large and active Deaf community in Rochester provides ample opportunities to evaluate and collaborate with to reduce health disparities. In order to achieve the goals outlined in the career development award, Dr. McKee will work closely with expert mentors to undergo a rigorous individualized curriculum plan that will provide further training in the fields of health literacy, deaf health, cardiovascular epidemiology, health disparities, survey methods, and advanced statistical analysis.  With the guidance of mentors, consultants and preceptors, Dr. McKee will conduct a research project to further his research skills development and to obtain new and valuable information about the association of health literacy and cardiovascular health on Deaf adult ASL users. To determine the degree of association, a cross- sectional study will be conducted with Deaf ASL users and hearing native English speakers. Multiple tools and questionnaires will be used to compare study between Deaf ASL users and hearing native English speakers to better determine whether health literacy is lower among Deaf ASL users and assess its potential association with increased cardiovascular risk.  Since no health literacy assessment tools exist for ASL users, an adaptation and translation of an existing health literacy assessment tool called the ""Newest Vital Sign"" (NVS) will take place. The adapted NVS will be the first of its kind assessment tool necessary for evaluating health literacy among Deaf ASL users. Measurements of English proficiency, health care access, and cardiovascular knowledge will be collected to determine its impact on cardiovascular health for both study groups. To determine the association of health literacy with cardiovascular health, we will utilize a non-laboratory based Framingham prediction score to evaluate the risk for cardiovascular disease for both the study and control group. By determining the prevalence and the degree of health literacy and its association with cardiovascular health risk in Deaf ASL users, we can learn how to better develop effective health literacy and cardiovascular health educational programs that are accessible in American Sign Language.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching aim of this proposed Mentored Career Development Award is for Michael McKee, MD to become an independent health services researcher with a career focused on health literacy in linguistic minority populations including Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users.

"Hypertension and Health Literacy in Vietnamese Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the tremendous progress that has been made in improving cardiovascular health in the U.S. during the last decade, many ethnic minority populations still experience significant health disparity gaps that stem from both a paucity of valid research and a lack of culturally sensitive care. In particular, there has been growing concern about the high prevalence (44%) of hypertension (HTN) among Vietnamese Americans (VA). Compounding that concern is the problem of insufficient health literacy, an underlying issue and source of stress that many first generation VA immigrants suffer from. The high prevalence of HTN and limited health literacy are major public health threats for this underserved and understudied population - as low health literacy severely limits their ability to adequately manage their health. A major obstacle in planning and implementing culturally appropriate HTN intervention programs for this high risk group is the lack of systematic research. Among the gaps in the literature, the following are the most imperative: (1) a lack of culturally appropriate health literacy assessment tools for those with HTN and (2) a lack of systematic research on the impact of health literacy on the management of HTN. To fill those gaps, the purpose of this study is to development a HTN specific health literacy tool. To achieve that goal, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: Develop a culturally appropriate HTN health literacy assessment tool for Vietnamese Americans with limited English proficiency; Specific Aim 2: Pilot test and refine the HTN health literacy assessment tool; Specific Aim 3: Assess the reliability and validity of the HTN health literacy assessment tool. Accomplishing those aims will provide an important foundation toward the candidate's immediate and long term goals of assessing, developing, and testing culturally and linguistically appropriate HTN chronic care management programs for Vietnamese Americans. Moreover, the findings and methodological lessons learned from this study will be beneficial for other researchers working with ethnic minority populations that are largely isolated by insufficient health literacy.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In accordance with the World Health Organization and the US Department of Health and Human Services, health literacy is a public concern due to its vital role in health promotion and disease prevention. This research will help support the need to improve health literacy as a way to promote health and improve the management of chronic diseases such as HTN.           Relevance to Public Health: In accordance with the World Health Organization and the US Department of Health and Human Services, health literacy is a public concern due to its vital role in health promotion and disease prevention.

"Influence of Health Literacy and Cancer among Rural Patients in Rehabilitation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy has emerged as an important construct because it's four components: cultural and conceptual knowledge, listening and speaking (oral literacy), writing and reading (print literacy), and numeracy affect the health outcomes of individuals. As individuals don't live in a vacuum, it is important to understand the complex interaction of health literacy at multiple levels of interaction from the individual to the family, health care system and community. Describing how these multiple points of view connect and influence each other for individuals with cancer and other chronic illnesses, from rural Appalachian communities who are in a rehabilitation setting is the under explored focus of this study. The current study is the first step in developing a program of research designed to address these complex interactions and gaps in the literature. Through in-depth interviews and focus groups, the goal of the present study is to explore the influence of health literacy from the individual, family, health care facility and the patient's rural home community point of view. We propose to achieve three specific aims: 1.) Describe the health literacy level of this population. 2.) Determine the supports and barriers found in an inpatient rehabilitation facility in terms of facilitating health communication and addressing potential health literacy issues. 3.) Address the impact of health literacy on the transition from a rehabilitation facility back to a person's rural home community. This descriptive pilot study is a critical first step toward our ultimate goal of developing and empirically assessing health literacy interventions for this population. Later inquiries will include an examination of current processes in a rehabilitation setting and how they positively or negatively support health communication particularly in terms of health literacy in rural populations. The long-term goal is to develop interventions that will decrease the barriers and enhance the supports in health communication to decrease poor health outcomes, decrease health disparities in rehabilitation and positively influence transitions between settings for individuals with cancer and other chronic disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Low health literacy has the potential to negatively impact individuals with cancer and other chronic illness who are in a rehabilitation setting in terms of health and well-being. Low health literacy can negatively impact issues such as self-management of cancer and other chronic illness and medication adherence. This problem is possibly compounded if the individual is from a rural community, transplanted to a metropolitan inpatient rehabilitation setting and then sent back to their rural community. It is important to understand how low health literacy interacts with the individual in their complex social setting, including family, health care setting and home community with the goal of reducing potential health disparities among this population.          ",Influence of Health Literacy and Cancer among Rural Patients in Rehabilitation,7894811,R03CA136444,"['Interview ', ' Kentucky ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Rural ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Printing ', ' Reading ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Rural Population ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Vacuum ', ' Writing ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Physical Function ', ' rehabilitation service ', ' metropolitan ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Population Study ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' social ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Rural Community ', ' Self Management ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Client ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' health literacy ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Health Communication ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Process ', ' Family ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health care facility ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Inpatients ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R03,2010,77462,0.23170810264215827
"Promotoras and Hispanic Workers' Occupational Health in Post-Katrina New Orleans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Promotores(as) and Hispanic Workers' Occupational Health in Post-Katrina New Orleans The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOHS) and its National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) have identified Hispanic construction workers, particularly those who are foreign-born and have immigrated recently, as a vulnerable group experiencing disproportionate occupational risks and significant disparities in access to interventions to reduce work-related injuries and illness. Multiple factors, including inadequate training made worse by language and cultural barriers, more dangerous job assignments and other potentially discriminatory hiring practices -- contribute to these disparities. Trained Lay Workers who are knowledgeable about a community - better known as promotores(as) de salud (""health promoters"") in Spanish - have been used nationally and internationally as facilitating agents in ""translating"" - both in the cultural and linguistic sense - evidence-based health care and public health interventions. Consistent with NIOSH's Research to Practice Initiative, RAND and Common Ground Health Clinic of New Orleans are partnering to conduct a research project to: 1) Develop and pilot a brief promotor(a) intervention for the Hispanic worker population to improve knowledge and use of preventive behaviors regarding respiratory exposures and other occupational risks, and 2) Explore the role of promotor(a) gender (e.g. male versus female workers for male clients) in the acceptability of the intervention and its effectiveness in transmitting related knowledge and motivating preventive behaviors. A randomized longitudinal controlled trial will be used to evaluate changes in worker's knowledge and use of preventive behaviors as a result of the intervention. The intervention will be developed and piloted by a joint investigator-community end-user team to promote its feasibility and effectiveness. The post-Katrina New Orleans environment - with an almost non-existent language and culturally-competent local public health infrastructure - provides significant opportunities to develop and evaluate innovative interventions targeting the health needs of the large influx of Hispanic workers helping to rebuild the area. The proposed research will not only contribute new knowledge about the effectiveness of promotor(a) interventions, in general, and occupational health promotion and prevention interventions, specifically, but also help address occupational health disparities in this highly vulnerable population. Lessons learned about the effectiveness of the proposed intervention or lack thereof in the challenging New Orleans environment will help inform other occupational health interventions for Hispanic and other vulnerable workers nationwide.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Hispanic construction workers are a vulnerable group experiencing disproportionately greater occupational risks and other disparities than almost any other population in the US workforce.

"Literacy & maternal health: defining obstacles to care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This revised application for an NICHD Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) seeks support to develop a program of research related to social factors contributing to disparities in maternal-child health. In particular, I am interested in identifying obstacles to preventive pediatric care for preterm infants related to maternal low literacy. While low literacy is common in populations with high rates of preterm birth and has been associated with poor care utilization in other settings little to nothing is known about the role of literacy in the utilization of pediatric care. This research is designed to lay the groundwork for a community based intervention to reduce obstacles to effective pediatric care utilization faced by women with low literacy. The proposed course of study includes: 1) an educational component, and 2) a research plan to be carried out through three linked studies. Study 1 is an analysis of a prospective study of low income, inner-city women following a preterm birth (< 35 weeks gestation; n=700). The goal of this study is to examine the association between maternal literacy and preventive pediatric care (well child visits and Up to Date vaccination status) as well as to assess potential mediators of this association. Study 2, with the same population, will utilize qualitative methods to clarify factors identified in Study 1 and uncover new obstacles to care from the perspective of the mothers. Study 3 utilizes the findings of the preceding work to develop a community based intervention to modify the obstacles identified in Studies 1 and 2. A home visiting model used widely to deliver services to low income women and their infants will be adapted to include health and literacy instruction to address the identified obstacles to pediatric care utilization. The educational component focuses on specific areas of advanced social science methodology, statistical methods, and the assessment of adult literacy, as well as the design of intervention trials, which are needed for the planned research studies and subsequent independent research career. This work will result in an R01 intervention study proposal to be submitted in the fourth year. The proposed research represents a unique opportunity to study the role of low literacy and pediatric care utilization in a setting in which the benefits of effective utilization are clear and well defined. The results of this work will also have important implications for understanding the role of literacy in health care utilization for the larger group of term infants.              ",Literacy & maternal health: defining obstacles to care,7798648,K23HD048915,"['Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Training ', ' Supplementation ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Characteristics ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Infant Health ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' literacy ', ' satisfaction ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mothers ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Vaccination ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' Services ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' Budgets ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Case Management ', ' Mediating ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' health literacy ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' task analysis ', ' service utilization ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2010,132614,0.07775746761759104
"PictureRx: An Intervention to Reduce Latino Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 50% of prescription medications are not taken as directed. The Institute of Medicine and others have highlighted the importance of improving prescription drug management in the United States, particularly among at-risk populations, including patients with low health literacy or limited English proficiency. Incorporating illustrations into medication instructions is a promising approach to help patients better understand and adhere to their medical therapy. PictureRx is an innovative, evidence-based, internet platform for educating patients about their medications. It generates illustrated daily medication schedules that depict what medications the patient should take at each time of day and the purpose of each medication. We were funded to adapt PictureRx to meet the needs of the Latino community through a Small Business Innovation Research grant, ""PictureRx: An Intervention to Reduce Latino Health Disparities"" (1 R43 MD004048-01). This scope of work includes conducting focus groups and interviews with Latino patients, health care providers, and an advisory group of national experts; adapting PictureRx based on this input; and performing a small randomized controlled trial to evaluate its effect on patients' understanding of their medication regimen. This competitive revision is submitted in response to Notice NOT-OD-10-034 (NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications for Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Transfer Technology Research Grants (R43/R44 and R41/R42) through the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet)). We propose to expand the scope of the funded R43 by performing additional basic behavioral science research on icons that illustrate the purpose of each medication. We currently have a set of more than 50 locally-developed icons that depict the drug indication. We will use an iterative design process to refine this set of icons, engaging patient focus groups as well as experts in the fields of cognitive psychology and human factors, who have agreed to serve as consultants. We will then perform computer-based experiments to assess the effect of the icons on participants' comprehension, answer time, recall, preferences, and satisfaction with medication instructions. Hierarchical regression models will allow us to determine the effect of patient characteristics, such as health literacy, inference ability, working memory, and processing speed, on patients' comprehension of icons and recall of medication instructions. Results of this investigation will provide important foundational knowledge on the use of icons in medication instructions, and will also form the basis for subsequent applied research in this area. Moreover, the findings will be immediately translated into practice through the small business applicant and PictureRx platform.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Institute of Medicine, American College of Physicians, and National Council on Patient Education and Information have highlighted the importance of improving prescription drug management in the United States, particularly among at-risk populations, including patients with low health literacy or limited English proficiency.

"Health Literacy among Deaf ASL Users and Cardiovascular Health Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Michael McKee, MD is a deaf family physician whose career is centered on healthcare for deaf individuals who communicate in American Sign Language (ASL). Deaf ASL users are considered to be a linguistic minority group that is medically underserved with barriers and characteristics similar to what is found among many other linguistic minority groups. This group is also largely understudied which prevents progress in the Healthy People 2010's goals to reduce health disparities among minorities and disabled persons.  Dr. McKee's goal is to become a leading expert and an independent investigator on the topic of health literacy among linguistic minority populations. He is most interested in studying the impact of poor health literacy on cardiovascular disease among Deaf ASL users. The unique environment of the CDC-funded Preventive Research Center: National Center for Deaf Health Research (NCDHR) at the University of Rochester provides a very ideal place for Dr. McKee to accomplish that mission.  Rochester, New York, has been anecdotally reported to have the highest per capita deaf population in the United States. The large and active Deaf community in Rochester provides ample opportunities to evaluate and collaborate with to reduce health disparities. In order to achieve the goals outlined in the career development award, Dr. McKee will work closely with expert mentors to undergo a rigorous individualized curriculum plan that will provide further training in the fields of health literacy, deaf health, cardiovascular epidemiology, health disparities, survey methods, and advanced statistical analysis.  With the guidance of mentors, consultants and preceptors, Dr. McKee will conduct a research project to further his research skills development and to obtain new and valuable information about the association of health literacy and cardiovascular health on Deaf adult ASL users. To determine the degree of association, a cross- sectional study will be conducted with Deaf ASL users and hearing native English speakers. Multiple tools and questionnaires will be used to compare study between Deaf ASL users and hearing native English speakers to better determine whether health literacy is lower among Deaf ASL users and assess its potential association with increased cardiovascular risk.  Since no health literacy assessment tools exist for ASL users, an adaptation and translation of an existing health literacy assessment tool called the ""Newest Vital Sign"" (NVS) will take place. The adapted NVS will be the first of its kind assessment tool necessary for evaluating health literacy among Deaf ASL users. Measurements of English proficiency, health care access, and cardiovascular knowledge will be collected to determine its impact on cardiovascular health for both study groups. To determine the association of health literacy with cardiovascular health, we will utilize a non-laboratory based Framingham prediction score to evaluate the risk for cardiovascular disease for both the study and control group. By determining the prevalence and the degree of health literacy and its association with cardiovascular health risk in Deaf ASL users, we can learn how to better develop effective health literacy and cardiovascular health educational programs that are accessible in American Sign Language.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching aim of this proposed Mentored Career Development Award is for Michael McKee, MD to become an independent health services researcher with a career focused on health literacy in linguistic minority populations including Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users.

"Refining Entertainment Education for Cancer Literacy in African American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The lack of health literacy in the United States represents a widespread and serious health threat (1). Entertainment Education (EE) embeds health information into entertaining narratives (2) and holds promise for increasing health literacy among large audiences. This study will investigate the effects of manipulating three narrative elements in audio soap operas that incorporate breast and colorectal cancer screening messages as EE recommends. Study participants will be African American women over 50 years old, an audience that has reported getting health information from soap operas (54) and for whom screening for these diseases is recommended (6). The research will be guided by the Transportation/Imagery Model (4) which theorizes that exposure to narratives changes health behavior and its determinants only when an audience member feels carried away or ""transported"" into a narrative world. We hypothesize that there will be higher scores on outcome measures among soap opera listeners than among members of a control group who listen to an expert interview. Among soap opera listeners, we expect higher levels of transportation when: (a) cancer screening messages are embeded in a central plot that involves main characters rather than in a subplot that deals with minor characters, (b) the narrative is a drama with a consistently serious tone instead of a comedy, and (c) the plot rewards the character for being screened with an immediately negative test result instead of with an eventually successful outcome of treatment that began early because of a positive screening result. When transportation scores increase, we predict increases in cancer literacy, other psychosocial screening determinants, intentions to seek information and screening, and actual information-seeking and screening behavior such as appointment- making. Formative research will guide the development of various versions of audio soap operas that will incorporate breast and colorectal screening messages. Then two randomized experiments will be conducted. Six hundred women will each hear one version of a soap opera in a small, face-to-face group. Participants will complete questionnaires immediately before and after exposure to the audiotape and one month later. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans have lower levels of health literacy compared to whites and African American women suffer negative breast and colorectal cancer disparities with regard to screening rates, late-stage diagnosis and death (8,9). The long-term objective of this study is to develop more effective ways to deliver health messages to and promote health literacy among African American women. The public health relevance of such knowledge lies in its potential to decrease health disparities in a significant minority population.          ",Refining Entertainment Education for Cancer Literacy in African American Women,8007445,R01CA129420,"['Questionnaires ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Participant ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Appointment ', ' health literacy ', ' Talents ', ' Procedures ', ' psychosocial ', ' Exposure to ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Drama ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Mails ', ' Transportation ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Woman ', ' Test Result ', ' cancer education ', ' Audiotape ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Screening Result ', ' Soaps ', ' Information Services ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Minority ', ' American ', ' Health behavior ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Staging ', ' Evaluation ', ' tool ', ' Communication ', ' Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Breast ', ' Control Groups ', ' United States ', ' Health ', ' Knowledge ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Behavioral ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Recommendation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Elements ', ' Indium ', ' In element ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Writing ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Interview ', ' Outcome ', ' member ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' experience ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Future ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Modeling ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' public health relevance ', ' Positive Test Result ', ' Process ', ' Research ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' functional health literacy ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' literacy ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Minor ', ' ']",NCI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,288950,0.10411962130597079
"Hypertension and Health Literacy in Vietnamese Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the tremendous progress that has been made in improving cardiovascular health in the U.S. during the last decade, many ethnic minority populations still experience significant health disparity gaps that stem from both a paucity of valid research and a lack of culturally sensitive care. In particular, there has been growing concern about the high prevalence (44%) of hypertension (HTN) among Vietnamese Americans (VA). Compounding that concern is the problem of insufficient health literacy, an underlying issue and source of stress that many first generation VA immigrants suffer from. The high prevalence of HTN and limited health literacy are major public health threats for this underserved and understudied population - as low health literacy severely limits their ability to adequately manage their health. A major obstacle in planning and implementing culturally appropriate HTN intervention programs for this high risk group is the lack of systematic research. Among the gaps in the literature, the following are the most imperative: (1) a lack of culturally appropriate health literacy assessment tools for those with HTN and (2) a lack of systematic research on the impact of health literacy on the management of HTN. To fill those gaps, the purpose of this study is to development a HTN specific health literacy tool. To achieve that goal, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: Develop a culturally appropriate HTN health literacy assessment tool for Vietnamese Americans with limited English proficiency; Specific Aim 2: Pilot test and refine the HTN health literacy assessment tool; Specific Aim 3: Assess the reliability and validity of the HTN health literacy assessment tool. Accomplishing those aims will provide an important foundation toward the candidate's immediate and long term goals of assessing, developing, and testing culturally and linguistically appropriate HTN chronic care management programs for Vietnamese Americans. Moreover, the findings and methodological lessons learned from this study will be beneficial for other researchers working with ethnic minority populations that are largely isolated by insufficient health literacy.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In accordance with the World Health Organization and the US Department of Health and Human Services, health literacy is a public concern due to its vital role in health promotion and disease prevention. This research will help support the need to improve health literacy as a way to promote health and improve the management of chronic diseases such as HTN.           Relevance to Public Health: In accordance with the World Health Organization and the US Department of Health and Human Services, health literacy is a public concern due to its vital role in health promotion and disease prevention.

"Health-Based Animated Webisode for Health Promotion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): BioTechnical Communications, Inc. (BTC) will develop and produce an animated serial drama Webisode based on the Entertainment-Education model of health education. The series will be marketed to healthcare websites and general interest African American-targeted websites. Using innovative new media approaches to reach a large African American demographic, the goal of this project is to improve health information seeking, along with increasing overall health awareness and knowledge in this targeted population. By combining media that is simultaneously entertaining, educational and culturally tailored to African Americans, we offer an innovative health education tool to reach a high health disparities population. The Webisode project is the next logical step based on our successful serial soap opera radio product, Keeping Up with the Walkers (KUWW), which educates people about health and disease that disproportionately affects African Americans. KUWW was recently licensed to SupeRadio for distribution in 50 black radio stations nationwide demonstrating BTC's track record bringing health communication products to market. In this Fast-Track application, Phase I will take 6 months to develop a ten-minute animated prototype based on a single health topic, obesity, and assess feasibility and appeal of this approach with an African American audience using focus group qualitative research. In Phase II, we will produce a 120-minute animated series covering six health topics that have high levels of disproportionate impact on the Black community. This newly animated Walkers series, which will be webcast on the Internet, will reach a more diverse audience including the younger at risk African American demographic, who have quickly adopted Internet-based communication. Using a web panel of African Americans we will conduct an outcome study of the efficacy of the Webisodes on participants' health seeking behavior, health knowledge, and perceived risk. The impact of the KUWW Webisodes on real world Internet users' health information seeking behavior will be tested to determine if our product can be used to drive viewers to seek more health information on the web. Our long-term goal for commercialization is to position the KUWW Webisode series at African American oriented websites to encourage viewers to seek more extensive health information and to adopt the positive health behaviors modeled by the KUWW characters. Currently, BTC hosts the website Journey To Wellness (www.journeytowellness.com); the additional reach of our partner organizations which have high impact websites, will serve to expand our potential audience and create future commercial partners for BTC's appealing and culturally tailored health communications products.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The mission of BTC is to have a measurable impact on the health of the African American community using a culturally relevant and easily accessible health education message to improve public health literacy and decrease health disparities.

"Surveillance of mortality and Morbidity in US workers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Race-ethnicity and socio-economic status health disparities in occupational health have not been extensively investigated. Although significantly under-reported, occupational disease and injury, and mortality represent a significant health impact on US workers and their families. However, the risks for this occupational mortality and morbidity are not evenly distributed. It appears that these risks disproportionately affect US workers from race-ethnicity subpopulations and from lower socio-economic class. The University of Miami NIOSH NHIS Research Group proposes to use their existing Study Database derived from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), augmented by newly released NHIS data, to explore issues of health disparities among US workers based on differences between race-ethnic and socio- economic classes. The augmented NHIS database of a representative sample of over 660,000 US workers will allow the exploration of morbidity and mortality differences between and within occupations by various race ethnic subpopulations and by socio-economic class. Based on their previous work, the Investigators propose to pursue more sophisticated theoretical models to evaluate pathways of occupational risk, and morbidity and mortality between and within occupational subgroups. The use of these models will allow the Investigators to assess the relationship between occupation, indicators of morbidity, and the risk of mortality, testing whether or not the mortality risks noted in worker subgroups are mediated by morbidity. In addition, the Investigators propose to use the new NHIS data and the additional statistical modeling to explore the issue of health disparities among US workers based on different socio-economic and race-ethnicity subpopulations. Finally, the Investigators propose to produce an additional interactive Monograph on Health Disparities and Occupation in US Workers that will be made available through the expanded Study Website www.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/niehs/niosh/). This study proposal satisfies at least 3 NIOSH research priority areas (NORA): Surveillance research methods with unique mortality and morbidity data on 1) the entire US workforce; 2) older, race-ethnic, lower socio-economic and gender-specific worker subpopulations; and 3) social and economic costs of workplace disease and injury.           ",Surveillance of mortality and Morbidity in US workers,8097969,R01OH003915,[''],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2011,330480,0.023891081014458082
"Advancing Research in Health Literacy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advancing Research in Health Literacy The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has defined health literacy as the ""degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions."" Unfortunately, fully 22% of US adults have only basic and an additional 14% have below basic health literacy. The relationship between limited literacy and adverse health outcomes has been well documented, and seminal reports about the ""problem of health literacy"" have been issued by the Institute of Medicine, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, American Medical Association, and Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospital Organizations among others. Each of these reports advocates further research to develop an effective response within health care systems to address the problem and research in health literacy has begun to flourish. An important next step to cultivate this emerging research field is to create a national professional interdisciplinary home for investigators dedicated to health literacy research. Currently no such venue exists. In this grant application we propose to deliver a third annual conference along a multi-year trajectory dedicated to the promotion of the field of health literacy research. The Institute of Medicine Health Literacy Round Table will support dissemination via their Web site and by holding a workshop and publishing a report on the findings of the meeting. This annual meeting will be designed to provide a venue to focus attention on health literacy research, emphasizing two important subthemes each year. In year three the sub-themes will be the role of health literacy in health disparities and the quality of health care. The meeting will serve as an incubator for young investigators and will encourage a cross- disciplinary exchange of knowledge and collaboration. We aim to create an environment in which controversial topics within the research community can be openly discussed.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advancing Research in Health Literacy The relationship between limited health literacy and adverse health outcomes has been well documented, and seminal reports about the ""problem of health literacy"" have been issued by the Institute of Medicine, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, American Medical Association, and Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospital Organizations among others.

"Measuring Health, Media, Computer & Digital Literacy Among Senegalese Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Senegal is a country that has made substantial investments in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) over the past ten years, allowing citizens access to global information systems. Today, health promotion in the developing world often involves digitally-based dissemination of health messages; however, health literacy scales to test the degree to which recipients process and use the information from these communications are lacking. Youth comprise a large component of the Senegalese population at present: 28% of the population is between 10-19 years of age. The transition from childhood to adulthood as teens develop physically, cognitively, and socio-emotionally has positive and negative impacts on health that can entail personal, social and monetary costs. Testing how youth audiences use Internet-based health information and how increased health literacy and e-health literacy impact outcomes of interest serve as the focal issues of interest underlying our FIRCA-BSS proposal. In the proposed study we bring expertise from the parent R01 grant (1-R01 HD059756-01) on adolescent health literacy to partner with Senegalese youth reproductive health researchers in the Regional Center for Training and Research in Reproductive Health (CEFOREP) and Riseau Africain de l'Education pour la Santis (RAES). We will draw a sample of 2,400 youth from approximately 5,000 high school students and out-of-school youth who will be concurrently participating with CEFOREP on the One World UK Learning about Living program. These youth will be drawn from 7 secondary schools and 3 informal learning settings in three regions of Senegal representing urban, peri- urban and rural settings and drawn as a subsample of classes. Participants will pilot a survey anonymously and answer pilot survey measures that include Media Consumption; ICT Use and Access; Basic Computer, Internet and Mobile Technology Literacy; Functional Health Literacy Levels; E-Health Literacy; Media Literacy; Knowledge; and Attitudes. Our goal is to adapt measures previously used among Senegalese youth, as well as measures used in the developed world, and create new measures to understand how youth in the developing world access, process, and use health information. The standardized measures we develop can then be used to assess and evaluate efforts to combat health disparities in Senegal and potentially other countries experiencing similar levels of communications technology development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this study is to create a valid and reliable set of measures that can be used as scales for assessing health literacy, e-health literacy, media and computer literacy, and use of and access to computers and the Internet among in- and out-of-school youth aged 14-21 in Senegal.

"EFFECTS OF HEALTH LITERACY ON HEALTH DISPARITIES IN HIV CLINICAL OUTCOMES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. Although they comprise only 13% of the US population, African Americans account for nearly half of the people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. As compared to other races/ethnicities, African Americans with HIV/AIDS have shorter survival times and more deaths (CDC, 2009). Although a number of factors are associated with these disparities, clear underlying causes remain elusive.  Moreover, African Americans and other racial/ethnic minorities are at heightened risk for low health literacy. Low health literacy among African American AIDS patients has been implicated as a contributing factor to disparities in medication adherence. An important component of traditionally defined adherence (pill- taking frequency), is medication management or ""concordance"" between patient and provider regarding a medication regimen. Concordance includes correct pill identification, comprehension of the number of doses/pills per day and the timing of doses as well as accurate interpretation of warning labels, food intake instructions. Our team found that poorer management (concordance) of a simulated HIV regimen among African Americans was mediated by low health literacy and numeracy (Waldrop-Valverde et al., 2010). Although there has been a proliferation of studies on the effects of poor adherence on clinical outcomes in HIV patients, comparatively little study has been conducted on the relationship of concordance to HIV clinical outcomes. Support for the importance of disentangling adherence from concordance is emerging among other health conditions (e.g., anticoagulation control, diabetes) and vulnerable populations (e.g. elderly). To our knowledge, however, no studies have tested medication discordance as a cause of disparate health outcomes.  Medication discordance may go unnoticed in routine clinical practice since adherence assessment is often limited to only measures of dosing frequency. Therefore, the magnitude of the problem of medication discordance in HIV is not well understood nor how it may impact disease progression and clinical outcomes. We suggest that medication discordance may be a root cause of health disparities among African Americans with HIV/AIDS and propose to test the hypothesis that low health literacy leads to medication discordance and, subsequently, to poorer HIV-related clinical outcomes for African American HIV/AIDS patients. As part of our primary model testing health numeracy/literacy mediated medication management and clinical outcomes, we will also include additional patient and system contributors to health disparities from medical sociological literature to develop a comprehensive model that represents the complex interaction of risk and protective factors for those with limited health literacy. Study aims will be tested in a sample of 600 HIV/AIDS patients stratified by race/ethnicity and followed for 6 months.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although a number of studies have examined underlying causes and associated risks for disparate disease outcomes among African Americans, far fewer studies have investigated the role of health literacy and specific health-promoting behaviors on health disparities, within the context of broader social, structural and economic realities. Through its innovative approach, this study will demonstrate the effect of poor functional health literacy on disparate health outcomes and improve conceptual knowledge of health literacy in relation to other individual and contextual variables that also shape disparities. Eliminating health disparities is a primary goal of the DHHS and this highly significant study will directly impact efforts to improve parity among our most vulnerable populations.            Although a number of studies have examined underlying causes and associated risks for disparate disease outcomes among African Americans, far fewer studies have investigated the role of health literacy and specific health-promoting behaviors on health disparities, within the context of broader social, structural and economic realities.

"Reaching a wider audience: Modifying NetWellness content and outreach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       According to a recent report by the Pew Internet in American Life project, the internet has become the third most common source of health information for Americans, ranking behind ""asking a health professional"" and ""getting advice from family or friends."" The proportion of Americans who use the internet grows every year, and more low income and disadvantaged populations are online than ever before. However, the vast majority of health information sites on the internet are written at a level which requires a high degree of literacy to comprehend. The proposed project will use a user-centered design process to adapt content from the extensive NetWellness.org web site to meet the needs of a disadvantaged, low literacy population. The project will initially target content related to diabetes and hypertension, two health problems with pronounced health disparities. The design process will be informed by established principles of design for reduced literacy populations and focus group input from members of inner city communities. The re-designed content will be tested with a panel survey of a group of potential site users, to establish whether the site meets their needs and is used to make changes in behavior, spur discussion with health care providers, and share with others.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed project is of very high relevance to public health. Providing information in a style and format that reflects community needs and wishes has the potential of reducing the knowledge gap and contributing to healthy decision making.

"Developing Evidence-Based Guidelines for Patient-Accessible Medical Record   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health information tools for patients, including patient-accessible Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and Personal Health Records (PHRs) are proliferating in both large and small practices and health care delivery systems nationally and this will surely accelerate due to the Obama Administration's commitment to eHealth. Given that 50% of the adult population reads at the 8th grade level and lower, and millions of adults have low or inadequate health literacy, we can assume that many aspects of these systems are ""high-barrier"" and hard to read and use. However, there has been very limited systematic end-user assessment of these systems with low-literacy patients.   This proposed exploratory R21 research is being done in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene which is promoting the adoption of a patient-accessible EMR primarily among providers who care for underserved patients. Our target population is adults who are low income, low-education level, low-literacy, predominantly minority adults living in Harlem, NYC. The targeted health domain will be cancer prevention and management.   Aim 1: conduct patient-centered research on a representative sample of patient-accessible EMRs with a focus on three core functions: 1) Medication Management, 2) Lab/Test Results, and 3) Health Maintenance (e.g., reminders for screenings). Our research will be based on a user-centered design approach including: health literacy load analysis; focus groups; task analysis; and usability testing. We will perform these analyses of these core functions using a sample of patient-accessible EMRs that are in wide-spread use in the United States and vary in structure and interface design.

"Developing Evidence-Based Guidelines for Patient-Accessible Medical Record    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health information tools for patients, including patient-accessible Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and Personal Health Records (PHRs) are proliferating in both large and small practices and health care delivery systems nationally and this will surely accelerate due to the Obama Administration's commitment to eHealth. Given that 50% of the adult population reads at the 8th grade level and lower, and millions of adults have low or inadequate health literacy, we can assume that many aspects of these systems are ""high-barrier"" and hard to read and use. However, there has been very limited systematic end-user assessment of these systems with low-literacy patients.        This proposed exploratory R21 research is being done in collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene which is promoting the adoption of a patient-accessible EMR primarily among providers who care for underserved patients. Our target population is adults who are low income, low-education level, low-literacy, predominantly minority adults living in Harlem, NYC. The targeted health domain will be cancer prevention and management.       Aim 1: conduct patient-centered research on a representative sample of patient-accessible EMRs with a focus on three core functions: 1) Medication Management, 2) Lab/Test Results, and 3) Health Maintenance (e.g., reminders for screenings). Our research will be based on a user-centered design approach including: health literacy load analysis; focus groups; task analysis; and usability testing. We will perform these analyses of these core functions using a sample of patient-accessible EMRs that are in wide-spread use in the United States and vary in structure and interface design. Aim 1(a): understand patients' perceptions of the perceived utility of EMRs and the specific functions associated with these systems, and identify factors that influence patients' acceptance of these systems. In addition, we will gather information on patients' concerns about the adoption of EMRs.       Aim 2: develop preliminary guidelines for content, design, testing, and introducing patient-accessible EMRs for underserved and at-risk populations that can be evaluated in a future larger-scale effectiveness study.

"Examination of Oral Health Literacy in Public Health Practice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  According to the 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey, 25 percent of US adults are functionally illiterate. Because written health information is frequently provided at above the tenth grade level, health messages are not reaching low literacy patients jeopardizing their health status. Low literacy has been found by researchers to have a detrimental effect on general health and the use of medical services. Evidence from research in medical settings consistently highlights the importance of comprehension and literacy for patient compliance and increased positive health outcomes. Although much is known about medical health literacy, there are no studies that have systematically studied oral health literacy. The purpose of this current application is to examine how a low dental literacy population interprets dental health prevention information, navigates the dental health system and whether participation in a large comprehensive public health program (WIC) can be effective in improving this process for pregnant women and their children and reduce health disparities. Specifically, we will: 1) Determine the dental health literacy rates among a low income, high risk population, 2) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in understanding preventive dental health information such as consent forms, oral hygiene instructions and compliance to fluoride instructions among a low income/low dental health literacy population 3) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in navigating the .dental health care system among a low income/low dental literacy population including compliance for dental appointments and appropriate use and 4) Evaluate the effects of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program on cumulative treatment and costs of dental services provided by Medicaid as well as oral health related quality of life in a population with low dental health literacy.           ",Examination of Oral Health Literacy in Public Health Practice,8092571,R01DE018045,"['Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Gingivitis ', ' Dental ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Health system ', ' Instruction ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Writing ', ' Knowledge ', ' Surgeon ', ' Caring ', ' Learning ', ' Prevention ', ' Health behavior ', ' literacy ', ' high risk ', ' Health ', ' Population ', ' Medical ', ' Hospitals ', ' American ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' programs ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Infant ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Low income ', ' Measures ', ' Time ', ' Preventive ', ' Research ', ' Patients ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Adopted ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Label ', ' Testing ', ' Medicine ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Foundations ', ' Woman ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Medicaid ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' instrument ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Comprehension ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' health literacy ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Navigation System ', ' Appointment ', ' Outcome ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' working group ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Services ', ' Process ', ' skills ', ' care systems ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Tooth Loss ', ' tenth grade ', ' high school sophomore ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Consent Forms ', ' Informed Consent Forms ', ' Informed Consent Documents ', ' Consent Documents ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' health related quality of life ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' Fluorides ', ' illiterate ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2011,338628,0.030460067913505032
"Health-Based Animated Webisode for Health Promotion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): BioTechnical Communications, Inc. (BTC) will develop and produce an animated serial drama Webisode based on the Entertainment-Education model of health education. The series will be marketed to healthcare websites and general interest African American-targeted websites. Using innovative new media approaches to reach a large African American demographic, the goal of this project is to improve health information seeking, along with increasing overall health awareness and knowledge in this targeted population. By combining media that is simultaneously entertaining, educational and culturally tailored to African Americans, we offer an innovative health education tool to reach a high health disparities population. The Webisode project is the next logical step based on our successful serial soap opera radio product, Keeping Up with the Walkers (KUWW), which educates people about health and disease that disproportionately affects African Americans. KUWW was recently licensed to SupeRadio for distribution in 50 black radio stations nationwide demonstrating BTC's track record bringing health communication products to market. In this Fast-Track application, Phase I will take 6 months to develop a ten-minute animated prototype based on a single health topic, obesity, and assess feasibility and appeal of this approach with an African American audience using focus group qualitative research. In Phase II, we will produce a 120-minute animated series covering six health topics that have high levels of disproportionate impact on the Black community. This newly animated Walkers series, which will be webcast on the Internet, will reach a more diverse audience including the younger at risk African American demographic, who have quickly adopted Internet-based communication. Using a web panel of African Americans we will conduct an outcome study of the efficacy of the Webisodes on participants' health seeking behavior, health knowledge, and perceived risk. The impact of the KUWW Webisodes on real world Internet users' health information seeking behavior will be tested to determine if our product can be used to drive viewers to seek more health information on the web. Our long-term goal for commercialization is to position the KUWW Webisode series at African American oriented websites to encourage viewers to seek more extensive health information and to adopt the positive health behaviors modeled by the KUWW characters. Currently, BTC hosts the website Journey To Wellness (www.journeytowellness.com); the additional reach of our partner organizations which have high impact websites, will serve to expand our potential audience and create future commercial partners for BTC's appealing and culturally tailored health communications products.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The mission of BTC is to have a measurable impact on the health of the African American community using a culturally relevant and easily accessible health education message to improve public health literacy and decrease health disparities.

"Promotoras and Hispanic Workers' Occupational Health in Post-Katrina New Orleans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Promotores(as) and Hispanic Workers' Occupational Health in Post-Katrina New Orleans The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOHS) and its National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) have identified Hispanic construction workers, particularly those who are foreign-born and have immigrated recently, as a vulnerable group experiencing disproportionate occupational risks and significant disparities in access to interventions to reduce work-related injuries and illness. Multiple factors, including inadequate training made worse by language and cultural barriers, more dangerous job assignments and other potentially discriminatory hiring practices -- contribute to these disparities. Trained Lay Workers who are knowledgeable about a community - better known as promotores(as) de salud (""health promoters"") in Spanish - have been used nationally and internationally as facilitating agents in ""translating"" - both in the cultural and linguistic sense - evidence-based health care and public health interventions. Consistent with NIOSH's Research to Practice Initiative, RAND and Common Ground Health Clinic of New Orleans are partnering to conduct a research project to: 1) Develop and pilot a brief promotor(a) intervention for the Hispanic worker population to improve knowledge and use of preventive behaviors regarding respiratory exposures and other occupational risks, and 2) Explore the role of promotor(a) gender (e.g. male versus female workers for male clients) in the acceptability of the intervention and its effectiveness in transmitting related knowledge and motivating preventive behaviors. A randomized longitudinal controlled trial will be used to evaluate changes in worker's knowledge and use of preventive behaviors as a result of the intervention. The intervention will be developed and piloted by a joint investigator-community end-user team to promote its feasibility and effectiveness. The post-Katrina New Orleans environment - with an almost non-existent language and culturally-competent local public health infrastructure - provides significant opportunities to develop and evaluate innovative interventions targeting the health needs of the large influx of Hispanic workers helping to rebuild the area. The proposed research will not only contribute new knowledge about the effectiveness of promotor(a) interventions, in general, and occupational health promotion and prevention interventions, specifically, but also help address occupational health disparities in this highly vulnerable population. Lessons learned about the effectiveness of the proposed intervention or lack thereof in the challenging New Orleans environment will help inform other occupational health interventions for Hispanic and other vulnerable workers nationwide.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Hispanic construction workers are a vulnerable group experiencing disproportionately greater occupational risks and other disparities than almost any other population in the US workforce. This project will pilot the feasibility and effectiveness of a promotor(a) (lay health worker) intervention to improve knowledge and behaviors of day laborers regarding their occupational risks from construction and clean-up activities post hurricane Katrina. Lessons learned will lend support for expanding and sustaining this approach for occupational health interventions for Hispanic and other vulnerable workers nationwide.           Hispanic construction workers are a vulnerable group experiencing disproportionately greater occupational risks and other disparities than almost any other population in the US workforce.

"Lower Washington Heights CBPR Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The specific aims of this research project are to improve health outcomes and decrease health disparities in the predominantly Latino/African American neighborhood of Washington Heights, located in Northern Manhattan. We propose to do this by building upon existing relationships among community organizations, New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University and by planning Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) that will utilize feedback from active community leaders so that we may jointly identify the most meaningful healthcare research priorities for the population of Washington Heights. This will be the beginning of a long-term CBPR agenda that includes assessing and measuring the outcome of current and future interventions that will be developed with active community participation. Living with the problems of poor healthcare outcomes, the community itself has earlier attempted to address the issues by forming strong collaborative partnerships among community organizations and with the neighboring Hospital and University. Through one such collaboration, the one upon which we wish to build this project, a coalition is currently changing the Washington Heights community in profound ways. This working partnership, known as the Health Academy Partnership Advisory Board, has already opened a health-oriented middle and high school called the Community Health Academy of the Heights, established in close proximity to New York Presbyterian. We propose to work with that Partnership Advisory Board to build the trusting relationships, organizational structures, and operational norms required to develop and sustain Community Based Participatory Research partnerships. At the end of the three year project, the partnership will have the capability, capacity and unity to successfully apply for research funding. Aim 1: Improve health literacy and information dissemination in Washington Heights by establishing a CBPR Partnership Advisory Board that will provide a structure for conducting CBPR projects that will improve health literacy and information dissemination. Aim 2: Develop an MOU between the New York Presbyterian Hospital (applicant organization), Columbia University, the Community League of the Heights, and the Community Health Academy of the Heights for the purpose of carrying out a CBPR project on health literacy and information dissemination. Aim 3: Provide a forum for community outreach by conducting at least 5 stakeholder focus groups and three open community forums that will identify the community's interest in addressing disparities in health and that will educate the community about health disparity conditions, health resources and the role of the CPBR Partnership in helping to remediate such disparities. Aim 4: In addition, we aim to design and create funding proposals for such research and for further interventions based on CBPR analyses and outcomes assessments.

"Health Literacy-Disparities and transition in teens with special healthcare needs Nearly 20 percent of U.S. adolescents have special health care needs that require health or health-related  services beyond that required by children generally. During adolescence, these youths begin the transition  from parental management to self-management of their health and healthcare and from pediatric to adult care  providers. Health literacy is an important tool in this transition but little is known about patterns of health literacy  in adolescents with special healthcare needs and its importance in self care. Our long-term goal is to improve  the quality of pediatric healthcare and to reduce health disparities through innovative approaches to adolescent  care. The objective of this study is to conduct a large-scale study of health literacy and health outcomes in  teens with special health care needs. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) Identify mediators and moderators of  racial disparity in health literacy in adolescents with special health care needs. Relationships tested will include  primary language spoken at home, rural/urban residence, and parental education; 2) Assess the relationship  between adolescent health literacy, parent health literacy and effective planning for the healthcare transition  from adolescence to adulthood; and 3) Assess the relationship between adolescent health literacy, parent  health literacy, and adolescent health indicators including health-related quality of life and healthcare  utilization. To accomplish these aims we will recruit 600 dyads of a teen, age 15-17, with special health care  needs and a custodial parent from enrollees in a large, diverse Medicaid managed care plan serving central  and southwestern Ohio. Participating teens and parents will independently complete assessments of  demographics, child health-related quality of life, functional health literacy, medical home status, and  healthcare transition planning. Health care utilization information in the year following the initial assessment will  be measured using administrative encounter data. Analyses will test the hypotheses that racial disparities exist  in health literacy and that disparities are mediated by parental education and other variables. We will also test  the hypothesis that disparities in health literacy are associated with disparities in transition planning and  inappropriate health services use. Results from this project will be used to design interventions that improve  the healthcare transition process and health services use by expressly addressing issues of health literacy and  to inform health care providers, payors, public health professionals, and policy-makers of the extent and  predictors of health literacy limitations and of the health and social costs associated with limited health literacy  in this population.

"Examination of Oral Health Literacy in Public Health Practice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  According to the 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey, 25 percent of US adults are functionally illiterate. Because written health information is frequently provided at above the tenth grade level, health messages are not reaching low literacy patients jeopardizing their health status. Low literacy has been found by researchers to have a detrimental effect on general health and the use of medical services. Evidence from research in medical settings consistently highlights the importance of comprehension and literacy for patient compliance and increased positive health outcomes. Although much is known about medical health literacy, there are no studies that have systematically studied oral health literacy. The purpose of this current application is to examine how a low dental literacy population interprets dental health prevention information, navigates the dental health system and whether participation in a large comprehensive public health program (WIC) can be effective in improving this process for pregnant women and their children and reduce health disparities. Specifically, we will: 1) Determine the dental health literacy rates among a low income, high risk population, 2) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in understanding preventive dental health information such as consent forms, oral hygiene instructions and compliance to fluoride instructions among a low income/low dental health literacy population 3) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in navigating the .dental health care system among a low income/low dental literacy population including compliance for dental appointments and appropriate use and 4) Evaluate the effects of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program on cumulative treatment and costs of dental services provided by Medicaid as well as oral health related quality of life in a population with low dental health literacy.

"Health Literacy among Deaf ASL Users and Cardiovascular Health Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Michael McKee, MD is a deaf family physician whose career is centered on healthcare for deaf individuals who communicate in American Sign Language (ASL). Deaf ASL users are considered to be a linguistic minority group that is medically underserved with barriers and characteristics similar to what is found among many other linguistic minority groups. This group is also largely understudied which prevents progress in the Healthy People 2010's goals to reduce health disparities among minorities and disabled persons.  Dr. McKee's goal is to become a leading expert and an independent investigator on the topic of health literacy among linguistic minority populations. He is most interested in studying the impact of poor health literacy on cardiovascular disease among Deaf ASL users. The unique environment of the CDC-funded Preventive Research Center: National Center for Deaf Health Research (NCDHR) at the University of Rochester provides a very ideal place for Dr. McKee to accomplish that mission.  Rochester, New York, has been anecdotally reported to have the highest per capita deaf population in the United States. The large and active Deaf community in Rochester provides ample opportunities to evaluate and collaborate with to reduce health disparities. In order to achieve the goals outlined in the career development award, Dr. McKee will work closely with expert mentors to undergo a rigorous individualized curriculum plan that will provide further training in the fields of health literacy, deaf health, cardiovascular epidemiology, health disparities, survey methods, and advanced statistical analysis.  With the guidance of mentors, consultants and preceptors, Dr. McKee will conduct a research project to further his research skills development and to obtain new and valuable information about the association of health literacy and cardiovascular health on Deaf adult ASL users. To determine the degree of association, a cross- sectional study will be conducted with Deaf ASL users and hearing native English speakers. Multiple tools and questionnaires will be used to compare study between Deaf ASL users and hearing native English speakers to better determine whether health literacy is lower among Deaf ASL users and assess its potential association with increased cardiovascular risk.  Since no health literacy assessment tools exist for ASL users, an adaptation and translation of an existing health literacy assessment tool called the ""Newest Vital Sign"" (NVS) will take place. The adapted NVS will be the first of its kind assessment tool necessary for evaluating health literacy among Deaf ASL users. Measurements of English proficiency, health care access, and cardiovascular knowledge will be collected to determine its impact on cardiovascular health for both study groups. To determine the association of health literacy with cardiovascular health, we will utilize a non-laboratory based Framingham prediction score to evaluate the risk for cardiovascular disease for both the study and control group. By determining the prevalence and the degree of health literacy and its association with cardiovascular health risk in Deaf ASL users, we can learn how to better develop effective health literacy and cardiovascular health educational programs that are accessible in American Sign Language.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching aim of this proposed Mentored Career Development Award is for Michael McKee, MD to become an independent health services researcher with a career focused on health literacy in linguistic minority populations including Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users. The aim of the proposed mentored research project is to assess health literacy and its association with cardiovascular health among Deaf ASL users.

"TRIAD-2 Center for Health Disparities Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   AIM Goals of the P20 Teamwork in Research and Intervention to Alleviate Disparities (TRIAD-2) Center of Excellence In Health Disparities Research continuation are to strengthen and expand our capacity to conduct family based clinical trial intervention studies, train health disparity researchers, engage the community In research, health literacy, and science education, and achieve outcomes that are translatable and transferable to, by, and for the community to reduce HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and related risk factors among African Americans, Hispanics, rural and low-Income populations in North Carolina and the nation.   APPROACH We will conduct two new family based intervention studies; add formal Responsible Conduct of Research and Social Determinants training; implement new Spanish language health research education; conduct new health literacy education and evaluation; and implement new middle school student and teacher science education. Study 1 is a risky sex HIV prevention intervention with African American girls and moms. Study 2 is a lay directed intervention for Hispanic diabetics and family members. Synergistic, interdisciplinary teams will work across Administrative, Research, Research Training and Community Engagement and Outreach Dissemination Cores. NEED North Carolina and its central area specifically, have experienced great population growth (top ten states) and increased minority populations (now 34.9%, up 37% since 2000) with resulting increases in health disparities. African Americans constitute 28% of the central NC population; Hispanics have increased >500% in two decades. NC always has been the ""buckle"" of the stroke belt, and now has been designated a ""diabetes hot spot"" (lAF, March, 2011). Also, HIV rates and risks among young African American girls are alarming (NCHS, 2011). Social determinants are major factors influencing these disparities, as poverty, lack of health coverage, and low educational attainment is very high among minorities. Disparity populations' health failed to meet many 2010 national and state targets/objectives, and is worse than new national [HP2020] and state [Healthy Carolinians 2020] targets for HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and related risk factors. Thus, this is an ideal natural laboratory for disparities research.                 This continuing center will conduct family based, community engaged health research, training, health literacy and science education activities focused on reducing health disparities, with emphasis on prevention, of HIV, diabetes complications and related risks.",TRIAD-2 Center for Health Disparities Research,8262721,P20MD002289,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' literacy ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Center for Health Statistics ', ' National Center for Health Statistics ', ' NCHS ', ' National Center for Health Statistics (U.S.) ', ' North Carolina ', ' Population Growth ', ' Poverty ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Self Management ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Rural ', ' diabetic ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' Funding ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' meetings ', ' middle school ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' science education ', ' empowerment ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' girls ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' education evaluation ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Health Sciences ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Outreach Research ', ' trend ', ' Hot Spots (Area of Increased Mortality) ', ' Hot Spot ', ' sex ', ' health literacy ', ' Minority ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' health equity ', ' population health ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA GREENSBORO,P20,2012,1215379,0.08808442031629803
"Measuring Health, Media, Computer & Digital Literacy Among Senegalese Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Senegal is a country that has made substantial investments in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) over the past ten years, allowing citizens access to global information systems. Today, health promotion in the developing world often involves digitally-based dissemination of health messages; however, health literacy scales to test the degree to which recipients process and use the information from these communications are lacking. Youth comprise a large component of the Senegalese population at present: 28% of the population is between 10-19 years of age. The transition from childhood to adulthood as teens develop physically, cognitively, and socio-emotionally has positive and negative impacts on health that can entail personal, social and monetary costs. Testing how youth audiences use Internet-based health information and how increased health literacy and e-health literacy impact outcomes of interest serve as the focal issues of interest underlying our FIRCA-BSS proposal. In the proposed study we bring expertise from the parent R01 grant (1-R01 HD059756-01) on adolescent health literacy to partner with Senegalese youth reproductive health researchers in the Regional Center for Training and Research in Reproductive Health (CEFOREP) and Riseau Africain de l'Education pour la Santis (RAES). We will draw a sample of 2,400 youth from approximately 5,000 high school students and out-of-school youth who will be concurrently participating with CEFOREP on the One World UK Learning about Living program. These youth will be drawn from 7 secondary schools and 3 informal learning settings in three regions of Senegal representing urban, peri- urban and rural settings and drawn as a subsample of classes. Participants will pilot a survey anonymously and answer pilot survey measures that include Media Consumption; ICT Use and Access; Basic Computer, Internet and Mobile Technology Literacy; Functional Health Literacy Levels; E-Health Literacy; Media Literacy; Knowledge; and Attitudes. Our goal is to adapt measures previously used among Senegalese youth, as well as measures used in the developed world, and create new measures to understand how youth in the developing world access, process, and use health information. The standardized measures we develop can then be used to assess and evaluate efforts to combat health disparities in Senegal and potentially other countries experiencing similar levels of communications technology development.        The goal of this study is to create a valid and reliable set of measures that can be used as scales for assessing health literacy, e-health literacy, media and computer literacy, and use of and access to computers and the Internet among in- and out-of-school youth aged 14-21 in Senegal. We will work collaboratively with Senegalese researchers.

"The Meaning and Impact of Limited Literacy for People with Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the fact that limited literacy has been found to be a strong predictor of health outcomes and health care utilization patterns across populations and health conditions limited research has examined the relationships among literacy and serious mental illness. Increasing our understanding of the patterns and prevalence of limited literacy among people living with the full range of psychiatric disorders is a necessary step to our understanding of the impact and meaning of limited literacy in the lives of people with mental illness. While the vision of ""a life in the community for all"" has been clearly articulated (Department of Health and Human Services, 2003) barriers to recovery and full community participation remain. The role of limited literacy, as one such barrier, has been poorly examined. Increasing our understanding of the role of limited literacy will inform our understandings of disparities experienced by people with serious mental illness (SMI) and efforts to reduce these disparities. This knowledge will also inform the development of treatment and service provision to best meet the needs of those with limited literacy and ultimately improve the capabilities of people living with mental illness to improve health and support full community participation. The goal of this study is to increase our understanding of the prevalence of limited literacy among people using public, urban mental health outpatient services and to examine mechanisms that inform our understanding of these relationships. We will examine the ways in which limited literacy affects the lives of people living with serious mental illness. The specific aims are: Aim 1: to more fully assess the domains of literacy, including reading, aural, and numeracy, among people receiving services at public, urban outpatient mental health clinics. Aim 2: to understand the relationships, and explore mechanisms, among psychiatric disorders, limited literacy and mental health service utilization Aim 3: to examine the impact of limited literacy on the lives and recovery of people living with mental illness.  The results of this study will inform and expand multiple fields of research including mental health services research, psychiatric rehabilitation and recovery, and literacy and education. In addition, these findings will provide needed knowledge to be used by those developing programs for people with mental illness and policies to promote health, wellness and participation for people with mental illness.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Inadequate attention has been paid to the role of limited literacy as a barrier to recovery and participation among people with serious mental illness (SMI). The proposed study, relies upon a mixed-methods, service-user informed, research design to examine the multiple domains of limited literacy among people with serious mental illness using public, urban, mental health outpatient clinics. Relationships among limited literacy (reading, aural and numeracy), psychiatric disorder, mental health service utilization and other salient mechanisms will be examined. Finally, the meaning and impact of limited literacy in the lives of people with SMI will be examined.              Inadequate attention has been paid to the role of limited literacy as a barrier to recovery and participation among people with serious mental illness (SMI).

"Reaching a wider audience: Modifying NetWellness content and outreach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       According to a recent report by the Pew Internet in American Life project, the internet has become the third most common source of health information for Americans, ranking behind ""asking a health professional"" and ""getting advice from family or friends."" The proportion of Americans who use the internet grows every year, and more low income and disadvantaged populations are online than ever before. However, the vast majority of health information sites on the internet are written at a level which requires a high degree of literacy to comprehend. The proposed project will use a user-centered design process to adapt content from the extensive NetWellness.org web site to meet the needs of a disadvantaged, low literacy population. The project will initially target content related to diabetes and hypertension, two health problems with pronounced health disparities. The design process will be informed by established principles of design for reduced literacy populations and focus group input from members of inner city communities. The re-designed content will be tested with a panel survey of a group of potential site users, to establish whether the site meets their needs and is used to make changes in behavior, spur discussion with health care providers, and share with others.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed project is of very high relevance to public health. Providing information in a style and format that reflects community needs and wishes has the potential of reducing the knowledge gap and contributing to healthy decision making.

"National Consortium for Multicultural Education for Health Professionals Annual M     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R13 application proposes to support a 2-day annual meeting to enhance the collaborative network, and maximize the long-term national impact of the National Consortium for Multicultural Education for Health Professionals (Consortium). Funded in 2004 by the NHLBI as a 5-year competitive training award program (K07) for U.S. medical schools, the Consortium uses the approach of addressing disparities by integrating cross-cultural education into health professional training. We propose to build on our success by implementing a meeting focused on an under-addressed topic in cultural competency education in medical education: Bias and stereotyping. To reduce costs, increase participation, and maximize collaboration, the meeting will be scheduled to coincide with the (DiversityRX) to be held Fall 2012 in Northern California. This meeting will provide an opportunity for experts in cultural competency and health literacy curriculum development to network with the National Association of State Offices of Minority Health, and bias and stereotyping researchers, and further build upon the exchange of ideas which began recently among research and practice professionals in cultural competency and health literacy. Specific aims include: 1) create a network of experts in cultural competency and health literacy curriculum development and research, 2) identify common competencies, approaches and assessment methods that can be applied to education and research in cultural competency for multiple health professions; and 3) advance research and publication potential of the combined fields of cultural competency and health literacy. The meeting comprises a: (1) networking event (n=30), 2) moderated roundtable (n=30-100) on strategies that may prevent bias and stereotyping in clinical practice or ameliorate its effects on health outcomes, (3) Skills-Building Workshop on preparing submissions to MedEdPortal with the Association of American Medical Colleges (n=20), and 4) working session (n=30) to develop a bias and stereotyping module for a draft Cultural Competency and Health Literacy Primer incorporating evidence-based strategies to assess and change provider behavior, and identify related research questions.

"Ethno-Cultural Barriers to Health Literacy/Disease Management in AAs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research suggests that regimen adherence for self-management of diabetes is a serious problem and reason for poor adherence may be rooted in low literacy, culture, and lifestyle. More research is needed in this area, as health literacy (HL) not only measures a person's ability to read and comprehend, but also the ability to act on medical instructions and information. This is particularly true for the African American community which suffers disparate impact from chronic illness. The substantive aim of this descriptive, mixed method study is to explore the effects of beliefs and culture on health literacy and ultimately the management of diabetes in AAs from four regions in South Carolina. Our methodological aim is to develop a reliable, valid and generalizable survey tool with items that represents cultural beliefs, values, experiences and preferences for health information. This study is innovative in that it acknowledges the heterogeneity of the AA community and will apply theoretically grounded models to guide the substantive and methodological aims. We will use focus groups and cognitive interviews in year one and instrument pre-testing and population survey implementation in years two and three. Findings from this study will guide the selection of messages and strategies that will be subsequently tested within targeted populations to improve health outcomes. This study can advance the science as it relates to promoting health literacy and disease management among vulnerable populations.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health literacy is the ability to read, write, understand and act on health information. Poor HL is common among people with diabetes, especially African-Americans (AA), and may help to explain poor health outcomes. Understanding factors related to disease management among heterogeneous AA sub-groups are essential to design and testing of interventions to improve self-management practices and health outcomes and reduce disparities.               Health literacy is the ability to read, write, understand and act on health information.

"Health-Based Animated Webisode for Health Promotion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): BioTechnical Communications, Inc. (BTC) will develop and produce an animated serial drama Webisode based on the Entertainment-Education model of health education. The series will be marketed to healthcare websites and general interest African American-targeted websites. Using innovative new media approaches to reach a large African American demographic, the goal of this project is to improve health information seeking, along with increasing overall health awareness and knowledge in this targeted population. By combining media that is simultaneously entertaining, educational and culturally tailored to African Americans, we offer an innovative health education tool to reach a high health disparities population. The Webisode project is the next logical step based on our successful serial soap opera radio product, Keeping Up with the Walkers (KUWW), which educates people about health and disease that disproportionately affects African Americans. KUWW was recently licensed to SupeRadio for distribution in 50 black radio stations nationwide demonstrating BTC's track record bringing health communication products to market. In this Fast-Track application, Phase I will take 6 months to develop a ten-minute animated prototype based on a single health topic, obesity, and assess feasibility and appeal of this approach with an African American audience using focus group qualitative research. In Phase II, we will produce a 120-minute animated series covering six health topics that have high levels of disproportionate impact on the Black community. This newly animated Walkers series, which will be webcast on the Internet, will reach a more diverse audience including the younger at risk African American demographic, who have quickly adopted Internet-based communication. Using a web panel of African Americans we will conduct an outcome study of the efficacy of the Webisodes on participants' health seeking behavior, health knowledge, and perceived risk. The impact of the KUWW Webisodes on real world Internet users' health information seeking behavior will be tested to determine if our product can be used to drive viewers to seek more health information on the web. Our long-term goal for commercialization is to position the KUWW Webisode series at African American oriented websites to encourage viewers to seek more extensive health information and to adopt the positive health behaviors modeled by the KUWW characters. Currently, BTC hosts the website Journey To Wellness (www.journeytowellness.com); the additional reach of our partner organizations which have high impact websites, will serve to expand our potential audience and create future commercial partners for BTC's appealing and culturally tailored health communications products.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The mission of BTC is to have a measurable impact on the health of the African American community using a culturally relevant and easily accessible health education message to improve public health literacy and decrease health disparities. An effective and culturally appealing animated Webisodes series aimed at an African American niche of Internet users will teach viewers about health risk reduction using the proven technique of entertainment-education.           8.

"IDEAS for a Healthy Baby: Reducing Disparities in Consumer Use of Quality Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to increase transparency regarding health care quality are partially guided by the belief that this information will enable consumers to make more informed choices. Although the amount of information reported on websites has increased dramatically, use by consumers remains limited and largely restricted to white, college-educated and middle-aged consumers. There are many barriers that prevent patients from making effective use of current public reporting websites, including failure to recognize that quality may vary between providers, lack of awareness of publicly reported data, limited internet access, and low health literacy and numeracy. Innovative approaches are therefore needed to overcome barriers to using these data, particularly in vulnerable populations, to ensure a health care system in which every consumer can benefit from public reporting. Patient navigator's help patients 'navigate' through the complex health care delivery environment, and use of patient navigators may be an effective approach to engage consumers and to help them interpret the information presented in public reports.  The scientific aims of the study are: 1) to test the efficacy of an office-based patient navigator to assist low-income pregnant women in using publicly reported data to select a pediatric care provider; 2) to assess the efficacy of the intervention in subgroups defined by parity, race/ethnicity, and health literacy; 3) to evaluate th importance of publicly reported information about quality compared to other factors when selecting a pediatric provider; and 4) to assess the intervention's impact on self-management of health care. Women attending the prenatal clinic at a large urban medical center will be enrolled, and randomized to the navigator intervention or an informational pamphlet control. Women randomized to the intervention arm will receive two 20 minute sessions with a trained patient navigator who will guide them in navigating and interpreting information about the quality of care provided at local pediatric practices as presented on the Massachusetts Health Quality Partners website. Women randomized to the control arm will receive a pamphlet detailing how to use the Massachusetts Health Quality Partners website, but will not have trained patient navigators. A survey designed for the purpose of this study will be administered at baseline and post-intervention. Health literacy, numeracy and level of activation for self-management of health care will also be assessed as potential mediators of intervention effectiveness. The primary study outcomes will be the average performance on clinical quality and patient experience measures for the practices selected in the intervention and control groups. Secondary outcomes will include analyses of efficacy among groups of women defined by parity and an assessment of the relative importance of factors considered when choosing a pediatric care provider. Successful completion of the study aims will yield important new knowledge about the value of guided web site navigation as a strategy to reduce disparities in the use of publicly reported information.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Numerous factors prevent consumers from making effective use of publicly reported information about the quality of health care, including limited recognitio that quality of care varies between physicians, lack of awareness of existing websites, limited internet access, low health literacy and numeracy. In the proposed randomized controlled trial we will evaluate the impact of providing assistance in the use and interpretation of information about the quality of pediatric care on the Massachusetts Health Quality Partners Quality Insights website among a population of low-income pregnant women. Results of the study will advance our understanding of effective strategies for overcoming barriers to using publicly reported information among vulnerable populations.              Numerous factors prevent consumers from making effective use of publicly reported information about the quality of health care, including limited recognitio that quality of care varies between physicians, lack of awareness of existing websites, limited internet access, low health literacy and numeracy.

"Advancing Research in Health Literacy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advancing Research in Health Literacy  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has defined health literacy as the ""degree  to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic  health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.""  Unfortunately, fully 22% of US adults have only basic and an additional 14% have below basic health literacy. The relationship between limited literacy and adverse health outcomes has been well documented, and seminal reports about the ""problem of health literacy"" have been issued by the Institute of Medicine, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, American Medical Association, and Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospital Organizations among others.  Each of these reports advocates further research to develop an effective response within health care systems to address the problem and research in health literacy has begun to flourish. An important next step to cultivate this emerging research field is to create a national professional interdisciplinary home for investigators dedicated to health literacy research. Currently no such venue exists other than this meeting. In this grant application we propose to deliver the fourth annual conference along a multi-year trajectory dedicated to the promotion of the field of health literacy research. The Journal of Health Communication will support dissemination with the fourth special issue of the journal dedicated to health literacy with papers from the meeting, edited by Dr. Paasche-Orlow. This annual meeting will be designed to provide a venue to focus attention on health literacy research, emphasizing two important subthemes each year. In year four, the sub-themes will be the role of health literacy in health disparities and the role of health literacy in prevention and care management.

"Reducing Workplace Chemical Exposures in Nail Salon Workers using an Owner-to-Wor     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last two decades, nail salons have cropped up on nearly every major street in the nation, with California currently home to the largest number of salons and licensed nail technicians. Nail salon workers routinely handle cosmetic products that contain a multitude of hazardous compounds including carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, reproductive toxins and respiratory irritants. However, available training materials lack comprehensive information about safety precautions that salons can take to minimize chemical exposures; including recommendations for less-toxic products, improved ventilation, safe handling of toxic compounds, personal protective equipment and other administrative controls (e.g., break time outside salons). Furthermore, despite the fact that Vietnamese immigrants dominate the California workforce, training materials are not translated to fit their needs. Consequently, nail salon workers needlessly suffer a number of health problems.  We propose to conduct an owner-to-worker education intervention using Vietnamese American nail salon owners to train workers within their salons on how to reduce workplace chemical exposures. Using a group randomized controlled trial design and targeting select areas in California with a large density of nail salons, we will conduct repeated surveys and personal air sampling to evaluate changes in workplace exposure, worker knowledge, behavior, and health effects between baseline and follow-up periods. The primary hypothesis is that there will be a significantly greater reduction in measured levels of air contaminants among workers in the intervention group than in the comparison group. The specific aims are to: 1) Enhance existing workplace chemical exposure reduction (WCER) education materials and survey instruments that target Vietnamese nail salon owners and workers. 2) Implement an owner-to-worker intervention to administer the WCER education materials. 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of the owner-to-worker WCER intervention for:  a)reducing the primary outcome of measured personal levels of air contaminants (e.g., toluene,  formaldehyde, methyl methacrylate and total volatile organic compounds) in workers;  b)influencing the secondary outcomes which include: i) increasing worker knowledge of WCER; ii)  modifying behavioral and environmental factors that promote WCER; and iii) reducing work-related  health problems (e.g., acute health symptoms).  The proposed intervention study is expected to have significant public health impact by reducing workplace chemical exposures in a large, rapidly-growing and predominantly immigrant workforce that is disproportionately exposed, with a goal to ultimately reduce health disparities.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study focuses on the high profile concerns of health risks from chemical exposures in the burgeoning nail salon industry, an industry dominated in California by Vietnamese immigrant workers. We will conduct an owner-to-worker education intervention using Vietnamese American nail salon owners to train their workers on how to reduce workplace chemical exposures and will evaluate changes in workplace exposure, worker knowledge, behavior, and health effects between baseline and follow-up periods using personal air monitoring measurements and administered survey information. The intervention is expected to have significant public health impact by reducing harmful workplace exposures in a large, predominantly immigrant workforce that is disproportionately exposed, and thus, ultimately designed to reduce health disparities.              The proposed study focuses on the high profile concerns of health risks from chemical exposures in the burgeoning nail salon industry, an industry dominated in California by Vietnamese immigrant workers.

"EFFECTS OF HEALTH LITERACY ON HEALTH DISPARITIES IN HIV CLINICAL OUTCOMES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. Although they comprise only 13% of the US population, African Americans account for nearly half of the people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. As compared to other races/ethnicities, African Americans with HIV/AIDS have shorter survival times and more deaths (CDC, 2009). Although a number of factors are associated with these disparities, clear underlying causes remain elusive.  Moreover, African Americans and other racial/ethnic minorities are at heightened risk for low health literacy. Low health literacy among African American AIDS patients has been implicated as a contributing factor to disparities in medication adherence. An important component of traditionally defined adherence (pill- taking frequency), is medication management or ""concordance"" between patient and provider regarding a medication regimen. Concordance includes correct pill identification, comprehension of the number of doses/pills per day and the timing of doses as well as accurate interpretation of warning labels, food intake instructions. Our team found that poorer management (concordance) of a simulated HIV regimen among African Americans was mediated by low health literacy and numeracy (Waldrop-Valverde et al., 2010). Although there has been a proliferation of studies on the effects of poor adherence on clinical outcomes in HIV patients, comparatively little study has been conducted on the relationship of concordance to HIV clinical outcomes. Support for the importance of disentangling adherence from concordance is emerging among other health conditions (e.g., anticoagulation control, diabetes) and vulnerable populations (e.g. elderly). To our knowledge, however, no studies have tested medication discordance as a cause of disparate health outcomes.  Medication discordance may go unnoticed in routine clinical practice since adherence assessment is often limited to only measures of dosing frequency. Therefore, the magnitude of the problem of medication discordance in HIV is not well understood nor how it may impact disease progression and clinical outcomes. We suggest that medication discordance may be a root cause of health disparities among African Americans with HIV/AIDS and propose to test the hypothesis that low health literacy leads to medication discordance and, subsequently, to poorer HIV-related clinical outcomes for African American HIV/AIDS patients. As part of our primary model testing health numeracy/literacy mediated medication management and clinical outcomes, we will also include additional patient and system contributors to health disparities from medical sociological literature to develop a comprehensive model that represents the complex interaction of risk and protective factors for those with limited health literacy. Study aims will be tested in a sample of 600 HIV/AIDS patients stratified by race/ethnicity and followed for 6 months.         Although a number of studies have examined underlying causes and associated risks for disparate disease outcomes among African Americans, far fewer studies have investigated the role of health literacy and specific health-promoting behaviors on health disparities, within the context of broader social, structural and economic realities. Through its innovative approach, this study will demonstrate the effect of poor functional health literacy on disparate health outcomes and improve conceptual knowledge of health literacy in relation to other individual and contextual variables that also shape disparities. Eliminating health disparities is a primary goal of the DHHS and this highly significant study will directly impact efforts to improve parity among our most vulnerable populations.

"Health Literacy and Health Disparities Among the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career development award proposes a program of training, data collection  and research to advance knowledge in the area of health literacy and health disparities  among the elderly.  Specifically, the aims of this project are (1) to understand the  relationship between measures health literacy and more general measures of cognition,  such as memory and numeracy; (2) to estimate the relationship between health literacy,  general cognition and health outcomes in a large and nationally-representative sample  of older Americans; (3) to analyze the mechanisms through which health literacy and  cognition affect health outcomes; (4) to analyze the role that health literacy plays in  determining health disparities across racial, ethnic or  socio-economic groups; (5) to  explore similarities and differences between the concepts of health literacy and financial  literacy, and compare the relationship between literacy and outcomes in both domains.  The research activities will be carried out through a program of primary data collection and secondary data analysis based on the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).  The primary data collection consists of a module of questions on health literacy and health knowledge to be collected from a subset of respondents to the 2010 wave of the HRS. Analysis of the data will also be carried out with guidance from an interdisciplinary team of mentors.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study examines how an individual's health literacy - that is, the ability to understand and process information related to health - affects his or her health. The study focuses on how health literacy in the elderly and near-elderly population is  related to more general cognitive skills such as memory and the ability to do simple  math problems.

"Advancing Research in Health Literacy  Project Abstract Paasche-Orlow, M: Advancing Research in Health Literacy The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has defined health literacy as the ""degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions."" Unfortunately, fully 22% of US adults have only basic and an additional 14% have below basic health literacy. The relationship between limited literacy and adverse health outcomes has been well documented, and seminal reports about health literacy have been issued by the Institute of Medicine, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, American Medical Association, and Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospital Organizations among others. Each of these reports advocates further research to develop an effective response and research in health literacy has begun to flourish. An important next step to cultivate this emerging research field is to create a national professional interdisciplinary home for investigators dedicated to health literacy research. Currently no such venue exists. In this grant application we propose to deliver a fifth annual conference along a multi-year trajectory dedicated to the promotion of the field of health literacy research. This meeting will be designed to provide a venue to focus attention on health literacy research, emphasizing the role of health literacy research in the elimination of racial and ethnic health disparities and on health literacy oriented interventions. The meeting will serve as an incubator for young investigators and will encourage a cross-disciplinary exchange of knowledge, collaboration, and creativity. We aim to create an environment in which controversial topics within the research community can be openly discussed. Dr. Paasche-Orlow has served as a guest editor for special journal issues emerging from each of the past meetings; we plan to continue our successful dissemination efforts with another special issue on Health Literacy to be published by the Journal of Health Communication. We also plan to improve the meeting's Web site so that it can serve as a public resource for sharing information about health literacy measurement instruments. This year the meeting will take place at the National Academy of Sciences building in Washington, DC.

"Lower Washington Heights CBPR Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The specific aims of this research project are to improve health outcomes and decrease health disparities in the predominantly Latino/African American neighborhood of Washington Heights, located in Northern Manhattan. We propose to do this by building upon existing relationships among community organizations, New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University and by planning Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) that will utilize feedback from active community leaders so that we may jointly identify the most meaningful healthcare research priorities for the population of Washington Heights. This will be the beginning of a long-term CBPR agenda that includes assessing and measuring the outcome of current and future interventions that will be developed with active community participation. Living with the problems of poor healthcare outcomes, the community itself has earlier attempted to address the issues by forming strong collaborative partnerships among community organizations and with the neighboring Hospital and University. Through one such collaboration, the one upon which we wish to build this project, a coalition is currently changing the Washington Heights community in profound ways. This working partnership, known as the Health Academy Partnership Advisory Board, has already opened a health-oriented middle and high school called the Community Health Academy of the Heights, established in close proximity to New York Presbyterian. We propose to work with that Partnership Advisory Board to build the trusting relationships, organizational structures, and operational norms required to develop and sustain Community Based Participatory Research partnerships. At the end of the three year project, the partnership will have the capability, capacity and unity to successfully apply for research funding. Aim 1: Improve health literacy and information dissemination in Washington Heights by establishing a CBPR Partnership Advisory Board that will provide a structure for conducting CBPR projects that will improve health literacy and information dissemination. Aim 2: Develop an MOU between the New York Presbyterian Hospital (applicant organization), Columbia University, the Community League of the Heights, and the Community Health Academy of the Heights for the purpose of carrying out a CBPR project on health literacy and information dissemination. Aim 3: Provide a forum for community outreach by conducting at least 5 stakeholder focus groups and three open community forums that will identify the community's interest in addressing disparities in health and that will educate the community about health disparity conditions, health resources and the role of the CPBR Partnership in helping to remediate such disparities. Aim 4: In addition, we aim to design and create funding proposals for such research and for further interventions based on CBPR analyses and outcomes assessments. Our hypothesis is that a strong pre-existing partnership of invested community organizations aligned with a research team based at the institutions surrounding the catchment area, and the use of Community Based Participatory Research can coalesce as an effective tool for change - both locally and, by extension, nationally.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our hypothesis is that a strong pre-existing partnership of invested community organizations aligned with a research team based at the institutions surrounding the catchment area, and the use of Community Based Participatory Research can coalesce as an effective tool for change - both locally and, by extension, nationally.          ",Lower Washington Heights CBPR Partnership,8215880,R13HD063194,"['Academy ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospitals ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Outcomes Assessment ', ' Outcome Assessment (Health Care) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Presbyterians ', ' Presbyterian Church ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Height ', ' interest ', ' middle school ', ' high school ', ' Structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Community Health ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,NEW YORK-PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL,R13,2013,29897,0.030678398157692167

"Health Literacy among Deaf ASL Users and Cardiovascular Health Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Michael McKee, MD is a deaf family physician whose career is centered on healthcare for deaf individuals who communicate in American Sign Language (ASL). Deaf ASL users are considered to be a linguistic minority group that is medically underserved with barriers and characteristics similar to what is found among many other linguistic minority groups. This group is also largely understudied which prevents progress in the Healthy People 2010's goals to reduce health disparities among minorities and disabled persons.  Dr. McKee's goal is to become a leading expert and an independent investigator on the topic of health literacy among linguistic minority populations. He is most interested in studying the impact of poor health literacy on cardiovascular disease among Deaf ASL users. The unique environment of the CDC-funded Preventive Research Center: National Center for Deaf Health Research (NCDHR) at the University of Rochester provides a very ideal place for Dr. McKee to accomplish that mission.  Rochester, New York, has been anecdotally reported to have the highest per capita deaf population in the United States. The large and active Deaf community in Rochester provides ample opportunities to evaluate and collaborate with to reduce health disparities. In order to achieve the goals outlined in the career development award, Dr. McKee will work closely with expert mentors to undergo a rigorous individualized curriculum plan that will provide further training in the fields of health literacy, deaf health, cardiovascular epidemiology, health disparities, survey methods, and advanced statistical analysis.  With the guidance of mentors, consultants and preceptors, Dr. McKee will conduct a research project to further his research skills development and to obtain new and valuable information about the association of health literacy and cardiovascular health on Deaf adult ASL users. To determine the degree of association, a cross- sectional study will be conducted with Deaf ASL users and hearing native English speakers. Multiple tools and questionnaires will be used to compare study between Deaf ASL users and hearing native English speakers to better determine whether health literacy is lower among Deaf ASL users and assess its potential association with increased cardiovascular risk.  Since no health literacy assessment tools exist for ASL users, an adaptation and translation of an existing health literacy assessment tool called the ""Newest Vital Sign"" (NVS) will take place. The adapted NVS will be the first of its kind assessment tool necessary for evaluating health literacy among Deaf ASL users. Measurements of English proficiency, health care access, and cardiovascular knowledge will be collected to determine its impact on cardiovascular health for both study groups. To determine the association of health literacy with cardiovascular health, we will utilize a non-laboratory based Framingham prediction score to evaluate the risk for cardiovascular disease for both the study and control group. By determining the prevalence and the degree of health literacy and its association with cardiovascular health risk in Deaf ASL users, we can learn how to better develop effective health literacy and cardiovascular health educational programs that are accessible in American Sign Language.

"Examination of Oral Health Literacy in Public Health Practice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  According to the 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey, 25 percent of US adults are functionally illiterate. Because written health information is frequently provided at above the tenth grade level, health messages are not reaching low literacy patients jeopardizing their health status. Low literacy has been found by researchers to have a detrimental effect on general health and the use of medical services. Evidence from research in medical settings consistently highlights the importance of comprehension and literacy for patient compliance and increased positive health outcomes. Although much is known about medical health literacy, there are no studies that have systematically studied oral health literacy. The purpose of this current application is to examine how a low dental literacy population interprets dental health prevention information, navigates the dental health system and whether participation in a large comprehensive public health program (WIC) can be effective in improving this process for pregnant women and their children and reduce health disparities. Specifically, we will: 1) Determine the dental health literacy rates among a low income, high risk population, 2) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in understanding preventive dental health information such as consent forms, oral hygiene instructions and compliance to fluoride instructions among a low income/low dental health literacy population 3) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in navigating the .dental health care system among a low income/low dental literacy population including compliance for dental appointments and appropriate use and 4) Evaluate the effects of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program on cumulative treatment and costs of dental services provided by Medicaid as well as oral health related quality of life in a population with low dental health literacy.

"IDEAS for a Healthy Baby: Reducing Disparities in Consumer Use of Quality Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to increase transparency regarding health care quality are partially guided by the belief that this information will enable consumers to make more informed choices. Although the amount of information reported on websites has increased dramatically, use by consumers remains limited and largely restricted to white, college-educated and middle-aged consumers. There are many barriers that prevent patients from making effective use of current public reporting websites, including failure to recognize that quality may vary between providers, lack of awareness of publicly reported data, limited internet access, and low health literacy and numeracy. Innovative approaches are therefore needed to overcome barriers to using these data, particularly in vulnerable populations, to ensure a health care system in which every consumer can benefit from public reporting. Patient navigator's help patients 'navigate' through the complex health care delivery environment, and use of patient navigators may be an effective approach to engage consumers and to help them interpret the information presented in public reports.  The scientific aims of the study are: 1) to test the efficacy of an office-based patient navigator to assist low-income pregnant women in using publicly reported data to select a pediatric care provider; 2) to assess the efficacy of the intervention in subgroups defined by parity, race/ethnicity, and health literacy; 3) to evaluate th importance of publicly reported information about quality compared to other factors when selecting a pediatric provider; and 4) to assess the intervention's impact on self-management of health care. Women attending the prenatal clinic at a large urban medical center will be enrolled, and randomized to the navigator intervention or an informational pamphlet control. Women randomized to the intervention arm will receive two 20 minute sessions with a trained patient navigator who will guide them in navigating and interpreting information about the quality of care provided at local pediatric practices as presented on the Massachusetts Health Quality Partners website. Women randomized to the control arm will receive a pamphlet detailing how to use the Massachusetts Health Quality Partners website, but will not have trained patient navigators. A survey designed for the purpose of this study will be administered at baseline and post-intervention. Health literacy, numeracy and level of activation for self-management of health care will also be assessed as potential mediators of intervention effectiveness. The primary study outcomes will be the average performance on clinical quality and patient experience measures for the practices selected in the intervention and control groups. Secondary outcomes will include analyses of efficacy among groups of women defined by parity and an assessment of the relative importance of factors considered when choosing a pediatric care provider. Successful completion of the study aims will yield important new knowledge about the value of guided web site navigation as a strategy to reduce disparities in the use of publicly reported information.          Numerous factors prevent consumers from making effective use of publicly reported information about the quality of health care, including limited recognitio that quality of care varies between physicians, lack of awareness of existing websites, limited internet access, low health literacy and numeracy. In the proposed randomized controlled trial we will evaluate the impact of providing assistance in the use and interpretation of information about the quality of pediatric care on the Massachusetts Health Quality Partners Quality Insights website among a population of low-income pregnant women. Results of the study will advance our understanding of effective strategies for overcoming barriers to using publicly reported information among vulnerable populations.

"Health Literacy and Health Disparities Among the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career development award proposes a program of training, data collection  and research to advance knowledge in the area of health literacy and health disparities  among the elderly.  Specifically, the aims of this project are (1) to understand the  relationship between measures health literacy and more general measures of cognition,  such as memory and numeracy; (2) to estimate the relationship between health literacy,  general cognition and health outcomes in a large and nationally-representative sample  of older Americans; (3) to analyze the mechanisms through which health literacy and  cognition affect health outcomes; (4) to analyze the role that health literacy plays in  determining health disparities across racial, ethnic or  socio-economic groups; (5) to  explore similarities and differences between the concepts of health literacy and financial  literacy, and compare the relationship between literacy and outcomes in both domains.  The research activities will be carried out through a program of primary data collection and secondary data analysis based on the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).  The primary data collection consists of a module of questions on health literacy and health knowledge to be collected from a subset of respondents to the 2010 wave of the HRS. Analysis of the data will also be carried out with guidance from an interdisciplinary team of mentors.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study examines how an individual's health literacy - that is, the ability to understand and process information related to health - affects his or her health. The study focuses on how health literacy in the elderly and near-elderly population is  related to more general cognitive skills such as memory and the ability to do simple  math problems.

"TRIAD-2 Center for Health Disparities Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   AIM Goals of the P20 Teamwork in Research and Intervention to Alleviate Disparities (TRIAD-2) Center of Excellence In Health Disparities Research continuation are to strengthen and expand our capacity to conduct family based clinical trial intervention studies, train health disparity researchers, engage the community In research, health literacy, and science education, and achieve outcomes that are translatable and transferable to, by, and for the community to reduce HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and related risk factors among African Americans, Hispanics, rural and low-Income populations in North Carolina and the nation.   APPROACH We will conduct two new family based intervention studies; add formal Responsible Conduct of Research and Social Determinants training; implement new Spanish language health research education; conduct new health literacy education and evaluation; and implement new middle school student and teacher science education. Study 1 is a risky sex HIV prevention intervention with African American girls and moms. Study 2 is a lay directed intervention for Hispanic diabetics and family members. Synergistic, interdisciplinary teams will work across Administrative, Research, Research Training and Community Engagement and Outreach Dissemination Cores. NEED North Carolina and its central area specifically, have experienced great population growth (top ten states) and increased minority populations (now 34.9%, up 37% since 2000) with resulting increases in health disparities. African Americans constitute 28% of the central NC population; Hispanics have increased >500% in two decades. NC always has been the ""buckle"" of the stroke belt, and now has been designated a ""diabetes hot spot"" (lAF, March, 2011). Also, HIV rates and risks among young African American girls are alarming (NCHS, 2011). Social determinants are major factors influencing these disparities, as poverty, lack of health coverage, and low educational attainment is very high among minorities. Disparity populations' health failed to meet many 2010 national and state targets/objectives, and is worse than new national [HP2020] and state [Healthy Carolinians 2020] targets for HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and related risk factors. Thus, this is an ideal natural laboratory for disparities research.                 This continuing center will conduct family based, community engaged health research, training, health literacy and science education activities focused on reducing health disparities, with emphasis on prevention, of HIV, diabetes complications and related risks.",TRIAD-2 Center for Health Disparities Research,8471183,P20MD002289,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' literacy ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Center for Health Statistics ', ' National Center for Health Statistics ', ' NCHS ', ' National Center for Health Statistics (U.S.) ', ' North Carolina ', ' Population Growth ', ' Poverty ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Self Management ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Rural ', ' diabetic ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' Funding ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' meetings ', ' middle school ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' science education ', ' empowerment ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' girls ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' education evaluation ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Health Sciences ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Outreach Research ', ' trend ', ' Hot Spots (Area of Increased Mortality) ', ' Hot Spot ', ' sex ', ' health literacy ', ' Minority ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' health equity ', ' population health ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA GREENSBORO,P20,2013,1143709,0.08808442031629803
"Using Innovative Communication Technology to Improve the Health of Young African     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite over thirty years of research and policy work, Black women are approximately twice as likely to deliver a preterm infant as white women. The current project is part of a new effort to focus on engaging young women before they become pregnant - a concept called preconception care. Simply, healthy women are more likely to have healthy babies. Intervention. This study is the first to examine the effectiveness of an innovative health communication system (Gabby) that provides preconception health care across 12 domains of health and utilizes advanced capabilities to remain current through story-telling functionality, and scales the intervention to a large number of women via its social marketing applications. Methods: A two-armed randomized controlled trial of African American women ages 18-25 recruited through community-based organizations. Both groups will undergo a comprehensive preconception health risk assessment. The intervention group will then receive the Gabby intervention. The control group will be sent a list of health risks generated by the health risk assessment. Outcomes: At twelve months, we will measure improvement in health risks. Secondary outcomes include measurement of usage rates, dose of exposure, attrition, patient and health worker and subject satisfaction, number of women with a personalized health plan, and timeliness of response. Sub analyses include the impact of perceived societal stress and health literacy on outcomes. Significance: The potential to create a low-cost, user-friendly, culturally competent, evidence-based, scalable intervention that is continuously refreshed (via the story telling function) and can be used across a range of health care, educational and community settings to improve the health of young African American women.          In an effort to address health disparities in birth outcomes for African American women, this research aims to translate evidence-based preconception care guidelines into the clinical setting. Our computer-based intervention has the ability to provide standardized, comprehensive preconception care that is patient-centered and culturally competent. If proven effective, this intervention could be used by all women and adapted to other high-risk populations, with the goal of reducing disparities in newborn morbidity and mortality.

"The Meaning and Impact of Limited Literacy for People with Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the fact that limited literacy has been found to be a strong predictor of health outcomes and health care utilization patterns across populations and health conditions limited research has examined the relationships among literacy and serious mental illness. Increasing our understanding of the patterns and prevalence of limited literacy among people living with the full range of psychiatric disorders is a necessary step to our understanding of the impact and meaning of limited literacy in the lives of people with mental illness. While the vision of ""a life in the community for all"" has been clearly articulated (Department of Health and Human Services, 2003) barriers to recovery and full community participation remain. The role of limited literacy, as one such barrier, has been poorly examined. Increasing our understanding of the role of limited literacy will inform our understandings of disparities experienced by people with serious mental illness (SMI) and efforts to reduce these disparities. This knowledge will also inform the development of treatment and service provision to best meet the needs of those with limited literacy and ultimately improve the capabilities of people living with mental illness to improve health and support full community participation. The goal of this study is to increase our understanding of the prevalence of limited literacy among people using public, urban mental health outpatient services and to examine mechanisms that inform our understanding of these relationships. We will examine the ways in which limited literacy affects the lives of people living with serious mental illness. The specific aims are: Aim 1: to more fully assess the domains of literacy, including reading, aural, and numeracy, among people receiving services at public, urban outpatient mental health clinics. Aim 2: to understand the relationships, and explore mechanisms, among psychiatric disorders, limited literacy and mental health service utilization Aim 3: to examine the impact of limited literacy on the lives and recovery of people living with mental illness.  The results of this study will inform and expand multiple fields of research including mental health services research, psychiatric rehabilitation and recovery, and literacy and education. In addition, these findings will provide needed knowledge to be used by those developing programs for people with mental illness and policies to promote health, wellness and participation for people with mental illness.          Inadequate attention has been paid to the role of limited literacy as a barrier to recovery and participation among people with serious mental illness (SMI). The proposed study, relies upon a mixed-methods, service-user informed, research design to examine the multiple domains of limited literacy among people with serious mental illness using public, urban, mental health outpatient clinics. Relationships among limited literacy (reading, aural and numeracy), psychiatric disorder, mental health service utilization and other salient mechanisms will be examined. Finally, the meaning and impact of limited literacy in the lives of people with SMI will be examined.

"Refining Conceptual Models for the Role of Health Literacy in Health Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite more than two decades of health literacy research, causal pathways linking health literacy to health outcomes have not been well-defined. The result has been continued controversy in the concept's definition and less-informed interventions attempting to either promote clear, actionable health communication or reduce literacy disparities in healthcare with variable success. The lead investigators (Paasche-Orlow & Wolf) have previously proposed a conceptual framework for health literacy.  While it has been frequently cited in the literature, there have been limited opportunities to test and refine the underlying premises. Indeed, no conceptual model of health literacy to date has been empirically tested. Leveraging several unique and large datasets that include an expanse of relevant covariates, we propose rigorous secondary analyses to investigate proposed causal pathways linking health literacy to health outcomes including intermediary chronic disease outcomes, quality of life, hospitalization and mortality risk.  In addition, we will specifically examine how health literacy may potentially serve a mediating role and in part explain certain known health disparities.  Associations between low health literacy and worse outcomes will be mostly explained by inadequate knowledge, self-efficacy, services use, and self-care behavior. Low health literacy, numeracy, problem-solving, and knowledge with health behaviors will represent significant mediators of the relationship between race/ethnicity and worse clinical outcomes. Seven unique and diverse datasets in which the most common measures used in health literacy research (REALM, TOFHLA, NVS, others) and a rich array of additional key variables were measured. Structural equation modeling, meditational and meta-analytic techniques to determine causal pathways linking health-related literacy, numeracy, problem-solving, and knowledge with health behaviors, outcomes, and disparities will be used. Chronic disease (HbA1c, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, asthma control) functional health status and quality of life cognitive function risk of hospitalization and mortality.  The outcomes are an improved understanding of the causal mechanisms linking health literacy to health outcomes and the role of health literacy in explaining health disparities. This will be the most extensive investigation of its kind, and will significantly contribute to our understanding of the important factors inherent in defining health literacy and how best to respond to the problem. We will disseminate our findings on a Web site to promote transparency and allow continued modification of the model as further data become available.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Researchers over the past several years have produced an unprecedented number of studies demonstrating very strong associations between low 'health literacy' and poor health outcomes. There have been many attempts to respond to the problem, but very few have been successful and those that have worked were multi- faceted strategies wherein the actual cause for any improvement was not clear. We will use rigorous analytic methods to refine conceptual models linking health literacy to health outcomes.  Improving our understanding of causal pathways will reveal the true targets for intervention, allowing for more effective solutions to mitigate the problem of low health literacy and potentially reduce disparities.               ",Refining Conceptual Models for the Role of Health Literacy in Health Outcomes,8578302,R01HL116630,"['Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Solutions ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' catalyst ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' wasting ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Wolves ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' health knowledge ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Collection ', ' Modification ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NHLBI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2013,458549,0.2308604258787388
"Measuring Health, Media, Computer & Digital Literacy Among Senegalese Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Senegal is a country that has made substantial investments in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) over the past ten years, allowing citizens access to global information systems. Today, health promotion in the developing world often involves digitally-based dissemination of health messages; however, health literacy scales to test the degree to which recipients process and use the information from these communications are lacking. Youth comprise a large component of the Senegalese population at present: 28% of the population is between 10-19 years of age. The transition from childhood to adulthood as teens develop physically, cognitively, and socio-emotionally has positive and negative impacts on health that can entail personal, social and monetary costs. Testing how youth audiences use Internet-based health information and how increased health literacy and e-health literacy impact outcomes of interest serve as the focal issues of interest underlying our FIRCA-BSS proposal. In the proposed study we bring expertise from the parent R01 grant (1-R01 HD059756-01) on adolescent health literacy to partner with Senegalese youth reproductive health researchers in the Regional Center for Training and Research in Reproductive Health (CEFOREP) and Riseau Africain de l'Education pour la Santis (RAES). We will draw a sample of 2,400 youth from approximately 5,000 high school students and out-of-school youth who will be concurrently participating with CEFOREP on the One World UK Learning about Living program. These youth will be drawn from 7 secondary schools and 3 informal learning settings in three regions of Senegal representing urban, peri- urban and rural settings and drawn as a subsample of classes. Participants will pilot a survey anonymously and answer pilot survey measures that include Media Consumption; ICT Use and Access; Basic Computer, Internet and Mobile Technology Literacy; Functional Health Literacy Levels; E-Health Literacy; Media Literacy; Knowledge; and Attitudes. Our goal is to adapt measures previously used among Senegalese youth, as well as measures used in the developed world, and create new measures to understand how youth in the developing world access, process, and use health information. The standardized measures we develop can then be used to assess and evaluate efforts to combat health disparities in Senegal and potentially other countries experiencing similar levels of communications technology development.        The goal of this study is to create a valid and reliable set of measures that can be used as scales for assessing health literacy, e-health literacy, media and computer literacy, and use of and access to computers and the Internet among in- and out-of-school youth aged 14-21 in Senegal. We will work collaboratively with Senegalese researchers. This will be a significant step toward expanding research among youth about new forms of health communication currently increasing in scope and breadth in Africa and worldwide.

"Reaching a wider audience: Modifying NetWellness content and outreach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       According to a recent report by the Pew Internet in American Life project, the internet has become the third most common source of health information for Americans, ranking behind ""asking a health professional"" and ""getting advice from family or friends."" The proportion of Americans who use the internet grows every year, and more low income and disadvantaged populations are online than ever before. However, the vast majority of health information sites on the internet are written at a level which requires a high degree of literacy to comprehend. The proposed project will use a user-centered design process to adapt content from the extensive NetWellness.org web site to meet the needs of a disadvantaged, low literacy population. The project will initially target content related to diabetes and hypertension, two health problems with pronounced health disparities. The design process will be informed by established principles of design for reduced literacy populations and focus group input from members of inner city communities. The re-designed content will be tested with a panel survey of a group of potential site users, to establish whether the site meets their needs and is used to make changes in behavior, spur discussion with health care providers, and share with others.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed project is of very high relevance to public health. Providing information in a style and format that reflects community needs and wishes has the potential of reducing the knowledge gap and contributing to healthy decision making. While we understand very well that information by itself cannot solve fundamental health disparities, access to information is a basic building block of improved health for communities.",Reaching a wider audience: Modifying NetWellness content and outreach,8514724,G08LM011075,"['Advertising ', ' Behavior ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Information Services ', ' literacy ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Library of Medicine ', ' National Medical Library ', ' National Library of Medicine ', ' National Library of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Ohio ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' Friends ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' meetings ', ' inner city ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Recipe ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' outreach to information ', ' Access to Information ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Information Resources ', ' Low Literacy Population ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' user centered design ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,G08,2013,87346,0.06753816194647318
"Health Literacy-Disparities and transition in teens with special healthcare needs Nearly 20 percent of U.S. adolescents have special health care needs that require health or health-related  services beyond that required by children generally. During adolescence, these youths begin the transition  from parental management to self-management of their health and healthcare and from pediatric to adult care  providers. Health literacy is an important tool in this transition but little is known about patterns of health literacy  in adolescents with special healthcare needs and its importance in self care. Our long-term goal is to improve  the quality of pediatric healthcare and to reduce health disparities through innovative approaches to adolescent  care. The objective of this study is to conduct a large-scale study of health literacy and health outcomes in  teens with special health care needs. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) Identify mediators and moderators of  racial disparity in health literacy in adolescents with special health care needs. Relationships tested will include  primary language spoken at home, rural/urban residence, and parental education; 2) Assess the relationship  between adolescent health literacy, parent health literacy and effective planning for the healthcare transition  from adolescence to adulthood; and 3) Assess the relationship between adolescent health literacy, parent  health literacy, and adolescent health indicators including health-related quality of life and healthcare  utilization. To accomplish these aims we will recruit 600 dyads of a teen, age 15-17, with special health care  needs and a custodial parent from enrollees in a large, diverse Medicaid managed care plan serving central  and southwestern Ohio. Participating teens and parents will independently complete assessments of  demographics, child health-related quality of life, functional health literacy, medical home status, and  healthcare transition planning. Health care utilization information in the year following the initial assessment will  be measured using administrative encounter data. Analyses will test the hypotheses that racial disparities exist  in health literacy and that disparities are mediated by parental education and other variables. We will also test  the hypothesis that disparities in health literacy are associated with disparities in transition planning and  inappropriate health services use. Results from this project will be used to design interventions that improve  the healthcare transition process and health services use by expressly addressing issues of health literacy and  to inform health care providers, payors, public health professionals, and policy-makers of the extent and  predictors of health literacy limitations and of the health and social costs associated with limited health literacy  in this population. One in six US teens has a special healthcare need that causes them to use more healthcare services than  other youths their age. These youths and their families need health literacy skills to navigate the  healthcare system. This study measures the presence of racial and socio-demographic disparities in  health literacy and tests whether limitation in health literacy are a barrier to the transition to adult care.",Health Literacy-Disparities and transition in teens with special healthcare needs,8514418,R01MD007160,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Resources ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Language ', ' literacy ', ' Medicaid ', ' Ohio ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Managed Care ', ' Mediating ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Self Management ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residence ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Funding ', ' Physician-Hospital Organizations ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Services ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Build-it ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Preparation ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' ']",NIMHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R01,2013,274137,0.1887370195309214
"Refining Conceptual Models for the Role of Health Literacy in Health Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite more than two decades of health literacy research, causal pathways linking health literacy to health outcomes have not been well-defined. The result has been continued controversy in the concept's definition and less-informed interventions attempting to either promote clear, actionable health communication or reduce literacy disparities in healthcare with variable success. The lead investigators (Paasche-Orlow & Wolf) have previously proposed a conceptual framework for health literacy.  While it has been frequently cited in the literature, there have been limited opportunities to test and refine the underlying premises. Indeed, no conceptual model of health literacy to date has been empirically tested. Leveraging several unique and large datasets that include an expanse of relevant covariates, we propose rigorous secondary analyses to investigate proposed causal pathways linking health literacy to health outcomes including intermediary chronic disease outcomes, quality of life, hospitalization and mortality risk.  In addition, we will specifically examine how health literacy may potentially serve a mediating role and in part explain certain known health disparities.  Associations between low health literacy and worse outcomes will be mostly explained by inadequate knowledge, self-efficacy, services use, and self-care behavior. Low health literacy, numeracy, problem-solving, and knowledge with health behaviors will represent significant mediators of the relationship between race/ethnicity and worse clinical outcomes. Seven unique and diverse datasets in which the most common measures used in health literacy research (REALM, TOFHLA, NVS, others) and a rich array of additional key variables were measured.

"Health Literacy among Deaf ASL Users and Cardiovascular Health Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Michael McKee, MD is a deaf family physician whose career is centered on healthcare for deaf individuals who communicate in American Sign Language (ASL). Deaf ASL users are considered to be a linguistic minority group that is medically underserved with barriers and characteristics similar to what is found among many other linguistic minority groups. This group is also largely understudied which prevents progress in the Healthy People 2010's goals to reduce health disparities among minorities and disabled persons.  Dr. McKee's goal is to become a leading expert and an independent investigator on the topic of health literacy among linguistic minority populations. He is most interested in studying the impact of poor health literacy on cardiovascular disease among Deaf ASL users. The unique environment of the CDC-funded Preventive Research Center: National Center for Deaf Health Research (NCDHR) at the University of Rochester provides a very ideal place for Dr. McKee to accomplish that mission.  Rochester, New York, has been anecdotally reported to have the highest per capita deaf population in the United States. The large and active Deaf community in Rochester provides ample opportunities to evaluate and collaborate with to reduce health disparities. In order to achieve the goals outlined in the career development award, Dr. McKee will work closely with expert mentors to undergo a rigorous individualized curriculum plan that will provide further training in the fields of health literacy, deaf health, cardiovascular epidemiology, health disparities, survey methods, and advanced statistical analysis.  With the guidance of mentors, consultants and preceptors, Dr. McKee will conduct a research project to further his research skills development and to obtain new and valuable information about the association of health literacy and cardiovascular health on Deaf adult ASL users. To determine the degree of association, a cross- sectional study will be conducted with Deaf ASL users and hearing native English speakers. Multiple tools and questionnaires will be used to compare study between Deaf ASL users and hearing native English speakers to better determine whether health literacy is lower among Deaf ASL users and assess its potential association with increased cardiovascular risk.  Since no health literacy assessment tools exist for ASL users, an adaptation and translation of an existing health literacy assessment tool called the ""Newest Vital Sign"" (NVS) will take place. The adapted NVS will be the first of its kind assessment tool necessary for evaluating health literacy among Deaf ASL users. Measurements of English proficiency, health care access, and cardiovascular knowledge will be collected to determine its impact on cardiovascular health for both study groups. To determine the association of health literacy with cardiovascular health, we will utilize a non-laboratory based Framingham prediction score to evaluate the risk for cardiovascular disease for both the study and control group. By determining the prevalence and the degree of health literacy and its association with cardiovascular health risk in Deaf ASL users, we can learn how to better develop effective health literacy and cardiovascular health educational programs that are accessible in American Sign Language.

"Using Innovative Communication Technology to Improve the Health of Young African     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite over thirty years of research and policy work, Black women are approximately twice as likely to deliver a preterm infant as white women. The current project is part of a new effort to focus on engaging young women before they become pregnant - a concept called preconception care. Simply, healthy women are more likely to have healthy babies. Intervention. This study is the first to examine the effectiveness of an innovative health communication system (Gabby) that provides preconception health care across 12 domains of health and utilizes advanced capabilities to remain current through story-telling functionality, and scales the intervention to a large number of women via its social marketing applications. Methods: A two-armed randomized controlled trial of African American women ages 18-25 recruited through community-based organizations. Both groups will undergo a comprehensive preconception health risk assessment. The intervention group will then receive the Gabby intervention. The control group will be sent a list of health risks generated by the health risk assessment. Outcomes: At twelve months, we will measure improvement in health risks. Secondary outcomes include measurement of usage rates, dose of exposure, attrition, patient and health worker and subject satisfaction, number of women with a personalized health plan, and timeliness of response. Sub analyses include the impact of perceived societal stress and health literacy on outcomes. Significance: The potential to create a low-cost, user-friendly, culturally competent, evidence-based, scalable intervention that is continuously refreshed (via the story telling function) and can be used across a range of health care, educational and community settings to improve the health of young African American women.          In an effort to address health disparities in birth outcomes for African American women, this research aims to translate evidence-based preconception care guidelines into the clinical setting. Our computer-based intervention has the ability to provide standardized, comprehensive preconception care that is patient-centered and culturally competent. If proven effective, this intervention could be used by all women and adapted to other high-risk populations, with the goal of reducing disparities in newborn morbidity and mortality.

"Reducing Workplace Chemical Exposures in Nail Salon Workers using an Owner-to-Wor     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last two decades, nail salons have cropped up on nearly every major street in the nation, with California currently home to the largest number of salons and licensed nail technicians. Nail salon workers routinely handle cosmetic products that contain a multitude of hazardous compounds including carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, reproductive toxins and respiratory irritants. However, available training materials lack comprehensive information about safety precautions that salons can take to minimize chemical exposures; including recommendations for less-toxic products, improved ventilation, safe handling of toxic compounds, personal protective equipment and other administrative controls (e.g., break time outside salons). Furthermore, despite the fact that Vietnamese immigrants dominate the California workforce, training materials are not translated to fit their needs. Consequently, nail salon workers needlessly suffer a number of health problems.  We propose to conduct an owner-to-worker education intervention using Vietnamese American nail salon owners to train workers within their salons on how to reduce workplace chemical exposures. Using a group randomized controlled trial design and targeting select areas in California with a large density of nail salons, we will conduct repeated surveys and personal air sampling to evaluate changes in workplace exposure, worker knowledge, behavior, and health effects between baseline and follow-up periods. The primary hypothesis is that there will be a significantly greater reduction in measured levels of air contaminants among workers in the intervention group than in the comparison group. The specific aims are to: 1) Enhance existing workplace chemical exposure reduction (WCER) education materials and survey instruments that target Vietnamese nail salon owners and workers. 2) Implement an owner-to-worker intervention to administer the WCER education materials. 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of the owner-to-worker WCER intervention for:  a)reducing the primary outcome of measured personal levels of air contaminants (e.g., toluene,  formaldehyde, methyl methacrylate and total volatile organic compounds) in workers;  b)influencing the secondary outcomes which include: i) increasing worker knowledge of WCER; ii)  modifying behavioral and environmental factors that promote WCER; and iii) reducing work-related  health problems (e.g., acute health symptoms).  The proposed intervention study is expected to have significant public health impact by reducing workplace chemical exposures in a large, rapidly-growing and predominantly immigrant workforce that is disproportionately exposed, with a goal to ultimately reduce health disparities.         The proposed study focuses on the high profile concerns of health risks from chemical exposures in the burgeoning nail salon industry, an industry dominated in California by Vietnamese immigrant workers. We will conduct an owner-to-worker education intervention using Vietnamese American nail salon owners to train their workers on how to reduce workplace chemical exposures and will evaluate changes in workplace exposure, worker knowledge, behavior, and health effects between baseline and follow-up periods using personal air monitoring measurements and administered survey information. The intervention is expected to have significant public health impact by reducing harmful workplace exposures in a large, predominantly immigrant workforce that is disproportionately exposed, and thus, ultimately designed to reduce health disparities.

"Translating Obesity and Diabetes Prevention into the Worksite for Immigrant Popul     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and diabetes are serious health problems in the United States, with rapidly increasing prevalence and incidence over the last 10 years. National data document alarming increases in overweight and obesity, and among Latinos the prevalence is 78%, markedly higher than in the general population. An estimated 25.6 million people 20 years or older have diabetes in the U.S., with the greatest increases in prevalence among racial and ethnic minority populations, further complicated by disparities in socioeconomic status. Hispanics face a diabetes prevalence twice that of non-Hispanic whites and suffer higher rates of diabetes complications and mortality. Nationally, it is estimated that there are over 2.6 million hired farm workers in the U.S., and California is among the largest employers of these workers. In California, over 450,000 people are employed in agriculture, with more than two-thirds being of Latino ethnicity. Most are immigrants with low levels of education and many have Spanish as their only language. This population also faces issues with limited access to health care, compounded by poverty and low socioeconomic status. While intervention efforts have demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle approach promoting diet and physical activity can significantly reduce obesity and diabetes incidence, there continues to be a need for effective programs designed for underserved and immigrant populations - a sizeable proportion of the U.S. working population. The overall goal of this study is to validate the effectiveness of an obesity and diabetes intervention among low-literate immigrant farm workers. We propose that a lifestyle intervention delivered at the agricultural worksite will improve obesity and diabetes risk for employees and will prove to be cost effective for the employer. The collaboration of established investigators at UC Davis with Reiter Affiliated Companies (RAC, a large berry grower in California) and the Health Initiative of the Americas at UC Berkeley (experts in organizing health campaigns for underserved immigrant populations) creates a unique opportunity to achieve significant positive health outcomes through a total worker health approach. Our efforts will build upon two successful pilot studies conducted with RAC and will enable us to reach a larger number of people and evaluate the program's translation and sustainability potential. Successful achievement of the project goals will enable dissemination of the program to improve the health of workers via a cost effective and culturally-tailored obesity and diabetes risk factor intervention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interventions, such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), have demonstrated that moderate lifestyle changes can significantly reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes incidence. Our approach is to deliver a obesity and diabetes lifestyle intervention in a culturally resilient context and integrated into a workplace setting. This intervention is designed to reach farm working and other immigrant Latino workers in low-wage industries, a large and growing population with an elevated risk for obesity and diabetes in the U.S. Additionally, the project includes an economic evaluation to appraise long-term sustainability, an important consideration for employers considering health and wellness programs.

"Health Literacy-Disparities and transition in teens with special healthcare needs Nearly 20 percent of U.S. adolescents have special health care needs that require health or health-related  services beyond that required by children generally. During adolescence, these youths begin the transition  from parental management to self-management of their health and healthcare and from pediatric to adult care  providers. Health literacy is an important tool in this transition but little is known about patterns of health literacy  in adolescents with special healthcare needs and its importance in self care. Our long-term goal is to improve  the quality of pediatric healthcare and to reduce health disparities through innovative approaches to adolescent  care. The objective of this study is to conduct a large-scale study of health literacy and health outcomes in  teens with special health care needs. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) Identify mediators and moderators of  racial disparity in health literacy in adolescents with special health care needs. Relationships tested will include  primary language spoken at home, rural/urban residence, and parental education; 2) Assess the relationship  between adolescent health literacy, parent health literacy and effective planning for the healthcare transition  from adolescence to adulthood; and 3) Assess the relationship between adolescent health literacy, parent  health literacy, and adolescent health indicators including health-related quality of life and healthcare  utilization. To accomplish these aims we will recruit 600 dyads of a teen, age 15-17, with special health care  needs and a custodial parent from enrollees in a large, diverse Medicaid managed care plan serving central  and southwestern Ohio. Participating teens and parents will independently complete assessments of  demographics, child health-related quality of life, functional health literacy, medical home status, and  healthcare transition planning. Health care utilization information in the year following the initial assessment will  be measured using administrative encounter data. Analyses will test the hypotheses that racial disparities exist  in health literacy and that disparities are mediated by parental education and other variables. We will also test  the hypothesis that disparities in health literacy are associated with disparities in transition planning and  inappropriate health services use. Results from this project will be used to design interventions that improve  the healthcare transition process and health services use by expressly addressing issues of health literacy and  to inform health care providers, payors, public health professionals, and policy-makers of the extent and  predictors of health literacy limitations and of the health and social costs associated with limited health literacy  in this population. One in six US teens has a special healthcare need that causes them to use more healthcare services than  other youths their age. These youths and their families need health literacy skills to navigate the  healthcare system. This study measures the presence of racial and socio-demographic disparities in  health literacy and tests whether limitation in health literacy are a barrier to the transition to adult care.",Health Literacy-Disparities and transition in teens with special healthcare needs,8706707,R01MD007160,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Resources ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Language ', ' literacy ', ' Medicaid ', ' Ohio ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Managed Care ', ' Mediating ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Self Management ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residence ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Funding ', ' Physician-Hospital Organizations ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Services ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Build-it ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Preparation ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' ']",NIMHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R01,2014,291763,0.1887370195309214
"Coccidioidomycosis Among California Hispanic Farm Workers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coccidioidomycosis is an important infectious health risk in California, especially in the dry San Joaquin Valley, which is a major center of agricultur. Caused by the soil-dwelling fungus Coccidioides immitis, exposure and infection may occur when high winds or human activity (e.g., agriculture, construction) aerosolize dust and infectious spores. High endemicity for Coccidioides immitis in California's San Joaquin Valley is of special concern because of the region's agricultural importance. Persons of Hispanic ancestry predominate among the agricultural labor force and are at increased risk for disseminated disease. Whereas agriculture has long been recognized for increased risk for coccidioidomycosis, studies have lacked precision for identifying high-risk crops or tasks. Moreover, there is little information on the knowledge levels and understanding of coccidioidomycosis among agricultural workers. The proposed work will contribute to the overall goal of reducing coccidioidomycosis in agricultural workers by (1) conducting a survey to assess knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors regarding coccidioidomycosis among 100 agricultural workers in Kern County, California, a highly endemic area; (2) conducting a case-control study (100 cases, 100 controls) to identify crops and agricultural work activities associated with coccidioidomycosis; (3) exploratory sampling of respirable dusts for Coccidioides, and (4) initiating work on translational preventive and educational programs designed to reduce the burden of coccidioidomycosis. Cross-sectors: while focused on the Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing sector, the proposed work addresses several of NIOSH's 24 industrial cross-sectors. These include Communication and Information Dissemination (through assessment of knowledge and development of educational prevention programs), Exposure Assessment (through innovative measurements Coccidioides in respirable dusts), Occupational Health Disparities (through a focus on farm workers, predominantly Hispanic, at increased risk for coccidioidomycosis), and Respiratory Diseases (through the focus on coccidioidomycosis). Expected outcomes and outputs: The major immediate outcome from the proposed work is improved understanding regarding (1) knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors relevant to coccidioidomycosis and (2) high-risk circumstances (i.e., crops and activities) among agricultural workers. Findings will be used to develop prevention programs (output) and lead to exposure reduction (intermediate outcome) to ultimately facilitate lowering of the health burden of coccidioidomycosis in agricultural workers (end outcome).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) is a lung infection caused by the soil-dwelling fungus, Coccidioides immitis, which is common in California's San Joaquin Valley and parts of the Southwest. Farm workers are at increased risk, as are persons of Hispanic, Filipino, and African- American ancestry. This study aims to assess knowledge about coccidioidomycosis among farm workers and identify high-risk work activities; this information will be used to develop preventive and educational programs to reduce the health burden of coccidioidomycosis in agricultural workers.            ",Coccidioidomycosis Among California Hispanic Farm Workers,8866856,U01OH010839,[''],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2014,275000,0.06654848877712695
"TRIAD-2 Center for Health Disparities Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   AIM Goals of the P20 Teamwork in Research and Intervention to Alleviate Disparities (TRIAD-2) Center of Excellence In Health Disparities Research continuation are to strengthen and expand our capacity to conduct family based clinical trial intervention studies, train health disparity researchers, engage the community In research, health literacy, and science education, and achieve outcomes that are translatable and transferable to, by, and for the community to reduce HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and related risk factors among African Americans, Hispanics, rural and low-Income populations in North Carolina and the nation.   APPROACH We will conduct two new family based intervention studies; add formal Responsible Conduct of Research and Social Determinants training; implement new Spanish language health research education; conduct new health literacy education and evaluation; and implement new middle school student and teacher science education. Study 1 is a risky sex HIV prevention intervention with African American girls and moms. Study 2 is a lay directed intervention for Hispanic diabetics and family members. Synergistic, interdisciplinary teams will work across Administrative, Research, Research Training and Community Engagement and Outreach Dissemination Cores. NEED North Carolina and its central area specifically, have experienced great population growth (top ten states) and increased minority populations (now 34.9%, up 37% since 2000) with resulting increases in health disparities. African Americans constitute 28% of the central NC population; Hispanics have increased >500% in two decades. NC always has been the ""buckle"" of the stroke belt, and now has been designated a ""diabetes hot spot"" (lAF, March, 2011). Also, HIV rates and risks among young African American girls are alarming (NCHS, 2011). Social determinants are major factors influencing these disparities, as poverty, lack of health coverage, and low educational attainment is very high among minorities. Disparity populations' health failed to meet many 2010 national and state targets/objectives, and is worse than new national [HP2020] and state [Healthy Carolinians 2020] targets for HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and related risk factors.

"An Intervention to Improve Cervical Cancer Detection among High Risk Latinas  Project Summary/Abstract Latinas have 70% higher incidence and double the mortality rate of cervical cancer than non-Latinas in the U.S., primarily due to low rates of screening and COLPOscopy, the recommended follow-up for abnormal Papanicolou (Pap) tests. Factors related to low rates include access to health care, anxiety, fear of pain and cancer, low educational and low health literacy levels. While the Affordable Care Act will increase access, it may decrease health care provider (HCP) time to provide complex education needed to address other factors. Patient education challenges for Latinas with low health literacy can be further complicated by language differences and by low basic literacy - an inadequate ability to read. Low literacy is not limited to Latinos but affects many who have had little opportunity for formal schooling. Due to high rates of low basic literacy, low health literacy, and increasing pressures on HCPs, we propose a paradigmatic shift in health education. The purpose of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to establish technical/scientific merit and feasibility of using an interactive computer-based education (ICBE) approach to educate and prepare Spanish speaking Latinas, with low educational and health literacy levels, for a colposcopy. This proposal is significant in its focus on the health disparity of cervical cancer in Latinas and on the need for quality health education in a changing health care environment. ICBE programs can greatly augment health education by providing time, basic health knowledge, repetition, language and attentiveness to personal and cultural barriers that vulnerable populations need, but that clinical settings realistically cannot provide. Specific aims for this Phase I study are to develop COLPO PRIMER-S (Spanish) and to pilot the product in a clinical setting. The long term goal is to create, evaluate and market the ""PRIMER series"" (Patient Ready Interactive Multi-media Educational Resources) - a line of health educational products appropriate for all literacy levels. Methods: COLPO PRIMER-S will be modeled after an English language version, but informed by a different literature for its content. It will be piloted at a health department in the Midwest U.S. with 20 women, half with low to marginal health literacy. Survey data assessing knowledge and preparedness, anxiety related to abnormal Pap and colposcopy, technology- related anxiety, learner pathway through COLPO PRIMER-S, acceptability and satisfaction with the program, and actual follow-up with the procedure will be collected through the touch screen and recorded automatically , before and after viewing and after colposcopy. HCP interviews will evaluate the amount of teaching needed for participants to begin using the program, difficulties encountered, user engagement with HCP following viewing, the impact on staff time and feasibility within the organization. While educational resources explaining colposcopy procedures do exist for Latina populations, none identified are theory and evidence-based ICBE, Spanish language programs that address literacy, knowledge and psychosocial barriers. Findings will guide paradigm shifts in health education and marketing of ICBE products and service. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Latina death rate from cervical cancer is nearly twice that of non-Latinas. Latinas, particularly those Spanish speaking with low-health literacy, have high no-show rates for colposcopy (standard follow-up for an abnormal pap result), which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer and, ultimately, needless deaths. This Phase I application will study the feasibility of an innovative, evidence-based, interactive, multimedia patient education program to promote empowered patient decision making and colposcopy adherence while also improving provider productivity and reducing costly patient no-shows.            ",An Intervention to Improve Cervical Cancer Detection among High Risk

"Examination of Oral Health Literacy in Public Health Practice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  According to the 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey, 25 percent of US adults are functionally illiterate. Because written health information is frequently provided at above the tenth grade level, health messages are not reaching low literacy patients jeopardizing their health status. Low literacy has been found by researchers to have a detrimental effect on general health and the use of medical services. Evidence from research in medical settings consistently highlights the importance of comprehension and literacy for patient compliance and increased positive health outcomes. Although much is known about medical health literacy, there are no studies that have systematically studied oral health literacy. The purpose of this current application is to examine how a low dental literacy population interprets dental health prevention information, navigates the dental health system and whether participation in a large comprehensive public health program (WIC) can be effective in improving this process for pregnant women and their children and reduce health disparities. Specifically, we will: 1) Determine the dental health literacy rates among a low income, high risk population, 2) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in understanding preventive dental health information such as consent forms, oral hygiene instructions and compliance to fluoride instructions among a low income/low dental health literacy population 3) Examine the role of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program in navigating the .dental health care system among a low income/low dental literacy population including compliance for dental appointments and appropriate use and 4) Evaluate the effects of the Women, Infant, and Children's Program on cumulative treatment and costs of dental services provided by Medicaid as well as oral health related quality of life in a population with low dental health literacy.

"Care2bWell: A Worksite Physical Activity & Wellness Program for Child Care Staff DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are approximately 1.3 million US child care workers, most of who are hourly employees and classified as low-wage earners. In North Carolina, half of these workers are African American or Hispanic. Many have no health insurance, putting them at increased risk for many serious and chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Regular physical activity (PA) is known to decrease risk of many chronic diseases; unfortunately, most Americans, especially low-income individuals and minorities, fail to meet PA recommendations. A multi-level worksite-based PA intervention offered in child care is an innovative strategy to reach these low wage workers and address health disparities among this high-risk population. While the primary target of our intervention is worker PA, we expect that healthier and more physically active workers will be better role models and promoters of healthy lifestyles for children in their care. This two-arm, cluster RCT (n=104 centers, with 4 workers/center) will test the efficacy of a 6-month Care2bWell (CARE) intervention in increasing workers' PA compared to a Financial Empowerment (FE) control arm. The CARE intervention will include a kick-off workshop, where participants get tailored feedback about their health risks and set behavioral goals, followed by three 2-month long wellness campaigns, during which workers monitor PA, receive tailored feedback, and compete in teams for prizes. Center directors will take part in monthly webinars focused on improving the work environment to support PA and wellness. Within a social ecological framework, Perceptual Control, Social Support, and Diffusion of Innovation theories guide intrapersonal, interpersonal, and center- level intervention components. Participants in the FE arm will receive a parallel intervention to enhance financial health at the individual and center levels. The primary outcome will be accelerometer-measured minutes of moderate to vigorous PA. Primary and secondary outcomes (diet, anthropometrics, psychosocial variables, & center wellness environments) will be assessed at baseline, follow-up (6 mo), and maintenance (18 mo). Detailed process evaluation, cost-effectiveness, and meditational analysis will be used to assess mechanisms of behavior change at the individual and center levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: People who work in lower paying jobs without health insurance, such as child care workers, are at increased risk for many chronic diseases (obesity, heart disease, diabetes).

"Health Literacy and Health Disparities Among the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career development award proposes a program of training, data collection  and research to advance knowledge in the area of health literacy and health disparities  among the elderly.  Specifically, the aims of this project are (1) to understand the  relationship between measures health literacy and more general measures of cognition,  such as memory and numeracy; (2) to estimate the relationship between health literacy,  general cognition and health outcomes in a large and nationally-representative sample  of older Americans; (3) to analyze the mechanisms through which health literacy and  cognition affect health outcomes; (4) to analyze the role that health literacy plays in  determining health disparities across racial, ethnic or  socio-economic groups; (5) to  explore similarities and differences between the concepts of health literacy and financial  literacy, and compare the relationship between literacy and outcomes in both domains.  The research activities will be carried out through a program of primary data collection and secondary data analysis based on the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).  The primary data collection consists of a module of questions on health literacy and health knowledge to be collected from a subset of respondents to the 2010 wave of the HRS. Analysis of the data will also be carried out with guidance from an interdisciplinary team of mentors.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study examines how an individual's health literacy - that is, the ability to understand and process information related to health - affects his or her health. The study focuses on how health literacy in the elderly and near-elderly population is  related to more general cognitive skills such as memory and the ability to do simple  math problems.

"Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Mass. CHC     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Massachusetts Community Health Center Abstract Health literacy, broadly defined as ""the wide range of skills and competencies"" that people use to manage their health (Zarcadoolas, et al. 2005, 196-197), is an important aspect of chronic disease self- management (Mancuso and Rincon 2006), though it has been inconsistently associated with medication adherence in multiple studies. While researchers continue to investigate the relationships among health literacy, medication adherence and health outcomes, few have successfully integrated individual-level factors such as health literacy with structural and social factors. In the proposed research, we rely on ethnographic and qualitative data, in combination with quantitative methods, to explore how medication adherence, a widespread problem in chronic disease management, is shaped by structural factors such as insurance copays, as well as by cultural health beliefs. Building on our previous research (Shaw, et al. 2012a, Shaw, et al. 2009b), the proposed study examines health literacy, health beliefs and barriers to medication adherence among patients from five ethnic groups (African-American, Hispanic, white, Vietnamese and Russian immigrant). We base this study in Massachusetts, which has recently expanded the number of people insured under publicly-funded programs while implementing cost-control measures that may limit access to prescription medications, especially for the poor. Drawing on self-report surveys, pill counts, chart review, in-depth interviews and other qualitative methods, this study will meet the following specific aims: 1. Using two different quantitative methods, to assess medication adherence among patients from 5  ethnic groups: (African-American, Hispanic, white, and Vietnamese and Russian immigrants) with  chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia); 2. Use qualitative and ethnographic methods to explore the chronic disease health beliefs that may combine with health literacy to shape medication adherence; 3. To identify factors associated with medication adherence among patients with low health literacy, including:  a. beliefs about medicines; b. food insecurity; c. socioeconomic factors (e.g., type of health insurance coverage; formulary changes); and d. social support. 4. To develop recommendations for primary care providers and policymakers to improve medication adherence and mitigate formulary changes among low-income patients with chronic illness. The unique constellation of conditions in Massachusetts-of near-universal insurance coverage coupled with stringent cost control measures as the state struggles to balance its budget-offers an unmatched research opportunity and serves as a critical bellwether for coming changes facing other states with the advent of the Affordable Care Act. The diverse population of patients served by Caring Health Center, the proposed research site, provides a natural laboratory in which to explore the effects of these policy changes as they intersect with culturally variable health beliefs to shape medication adherence among urban, minority and low-income patients. Improved understanding of these complex dynamics will better prepare primary health care providers to improve adherence and help reduce stroke risk among patients with hypertension and other chronic conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Massachusetts Community Health Center Project Narrative Health literacy plays a pivotal role in shaping the course of chronic disease, including health status, disease severity and patient adherence with prescribed medications. Urban, minority and low-income patients are at higher risk of non adhererence to their chronic disease medication regimens. While much research has been done on patient literacy and readability of forms such as informed consent and patient education materials, fewer studies have explored the relationship between health literacy, structural factors, cultural health beliefs, and medication adherence. This study focuses on an inner-city population burdened by significant disparities in diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and obesity. Not only are Springfield residents 12- 65 percent more likely to be affected by these conditions than Massachusetts residents as a whole, but the city's Black and Latino residents are 20-65 percent more likely to be affected than their Black or Latino counterparts statewide (MDPH 2003-2007). It is well-established that regular adherence to prescribed medication can help reduce the incidence and impact of chronic disease, including stroke. Yet minority and low-income patients, in particular, face significant barriers in adhering o their medication regimens, making them less likely to benefit from available care. Study results have potential national significance, especially in the context of coming changes in the nation's health care system. As tens of millions of additional individuals gain insurance coverage, cost control measures such as formulary changes and copayment tiers will become increasingly common. The Affordable Care Act invests billions more in community health centers over the next decade, and it will become increasingly important to identify effective strategies to improve medication adherence which can be integrated into those clinics where so many of those at highest risk for obesity and chronic illness receive care. Increasing our understanding of cultural factors, including cultural health beliefs, and their relationship to medication adherence among patients with low health literacy, holds significant promise for efforts to reduce disproportionate stroke risk and mortality among minority and low- income populations.            ","Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Mass.

"The Meaning and Impact of Limited Literacy for People with Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the fact that limited literacy has been found to be a strong predictor of health outcomes and health care utilization patterns across populations and health conditions limited research has examined the relationships among literacy and serious mental illness. Increasing our understanding of the patterns and prevalence of limited literacy among people living with the full range of psychiatric disorders is a necessary step to our understanding of the impact and meaning of limited literacy in the lives of people with mental illness. While the vision of ""a life in the community for all"" has been clearly articulated (Department of Health and Human Services, 2003) barriers to recovery and full community participation remain. The role of limited literacy, as one such barrier, has been poorly examined. Increasing our understanding of the role of limited literacy will inform our understandings of disparities experienced by people with serious mental illness (SMI) and efforts to reduce these disparities. This knowledge will also inform the development of treatment and service provision to best meet the needs of those with limited literacy and ultimately improve the capabilities of people living with mental illness to improve health and support full community participation. The goal of this study is to increase our understanding of the prevalence of limited literacy among people using public, urban mental health outpatient services and to examine mechanisms that inform our understanding of these relationships. We will examine the ways in which limited literacy affects the lives of people living with serious mental illness. The specific aims are: Aim 1: to more fully assess the domains of literacy, including reading, aural, and numeracy, among people receiving services at public, urban outpatient mental health clinics. Aim 2: to understand the relationships, and explore mechanisms, among psychiatric disorders, limited literacy and mental health service utilization Aim 3: to examine the impact of limited literacy on the lives and recovery of people living with mental illness.  The results of this study will inform and expand multiple fields of research including mental health services research, psychiatric rehabilitation and recovery, and literacy and education. In addition, these findings will provide needed knowledge to be used by those developing programs for people with mental illness and policies to promote health, wellness and participation for people with mental illness.          Inadequate attention has been paid to the role of limited literacy as a barrier to recovery and participation among people with serious mental illness (SMI). The proposed study, relies upon a mixed-methods, service-user informed, research design to examine the multiple domains of limited literacy among people with serious mental illness using public, urban, mental health outpatient clinics. Relationships among limited literacy (reading, aural and numeracy), psychiatric disorder, mental health service utilization and other salient mechanisms will be examined. Finally, the meaning and impact of limited literacy in the lives of people with SMI will be examined.

"Identifying Areas for Family Intervention to Improve Adult Diabetes Self-Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For adults with diabetes, regular self-care behaviors (i.e., diet, exercise, and medication adherence) prevent disease-related complications and premature death. However, patients with low socioeconomic status, low health literacy, and high levels of family stress are less likely to maintain self-care behaviors and more likely to have uncontrolled glycemia. Even in settings with equivalent access and care (e.g., federally qualified health centers-FQHCs), African American and Hispanic patients are less adherent to self-care behaviors and have worse glycemic control than Whites, suggesting behavioral barriers to self-care play a critical role. Family support may be an untapped resource with potential to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities among adults with diabetes. Family support for diabetes self-care (e.g., reminding patients to take or refill medication, planning healthy meals, participating in exercise with the patient, problem-solving with the patient when barriers to self-care arise) increases the likelihood that patients perform regular self-care, and can improve clinical outcomes for patients with low income, low health literacy, and high stress. However, it remains unclear how family member behaviors influence patient self-care and clinical outcomes, and how race or comorbid depression might moderate the effects of family member behaviors on patients' self-care behaviors. To explore these issues, the principal investigator (PI) will partner with and extend an ongoing study of diabetes medication adherence in a low-income, racially diverse sample of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The proposed plan will prepare the PI for success as an independent investigator who can develop and implement effective family interventions for adults with diabetes in community health organizations. The PI's immediate goals are to (1) develop proficiency with advanced quantitative methods to explore complex relationships cross-sectionally and contribute to the knowledge base on family support for adults with diabetes, (2) combine quantitative and qualitative methods to understand differences in the role of family support based on race, and (3) gain experience partnering with a FQHC and working with providers to conduct clinically relevant research. Through the proposed training plan, the PI will become an established researcher in the area of family support for diabetes self-care, and will gain training in translating research findings to be implementable in community health care contexts. She will submit a K01 proposal to develop and pilot a family intervention in a FQHC based on findings from the proposed research strategy. To meet these goals, the PI has developed a training plan that integrates advanced didactic course work, participation in local and national research meetings/conferences, a mentored research experience (including data collection at a FQHC), and active involvement in an extremely supportive and innovative research environment (which includes an NIDDK- funded Diabetes Center for Translational Research, a Clinical and Translational Science Award, and a Community-Engaged Research Core).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Engaging family members in self-care behaviors of adults with diabetes may reduce health disparities and decrease the likelihood of intergenerational patterns of obesity and diabetes-related behaviors. This F32 award will allow the PI to gain expertise in family support for diabetes self-care to advance the knowledge base, and develop and pilot a family intervention for adults with diabetes and low socioeconomic status.            ",Identifying Areas for Family Intervention to Improve Adult Diabetes Self-Care,8588790,F32DK097880,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Glycated Hemoglobins ', ' Glycosylated Hemoglobin ', ' Goals ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Advancing Research in Health Literacy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has defined health literacy as the ""degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions"". Unfortunately, fully 22% of US adults have only basic and an additional 14% have below basic health literacy. The relationship between limited literacy and adverse health outcomes has been well documented, and seminal reports about health literacy have been issued by the Institute of Medicine, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the American Medical Association among others. Each of these reports advocates further research to develop an effective response and research in health literacy has begun to flourish. An important next step to cultivate this emerging research field is to create a national professional interdisciplinary home for investigators dedicated to health literacy research. In this grant application we propose to deliver a seventh annual conference along a multi-year trajectory dedicated to the promotion of the field of health literacy research. This meeting will be designed to provide a venue to focus attention on health literacy research, emphasizing the role of health literacy in implementing the Affordable Care Act and for the elimination of health disparities. This venue serves crucial functions for the field of health literacy by providing an incubator for young investigators and encouraging a cross-disciplinary exchange of knowledge, collaboration, and creativity. We aim to create an environment in which controversial topics within the research community can be openly discussed. Dr. Paasche-Orlow has served as a guest editor for special journal issues emerging from each of the past meetings; we plan to continue our successful dissemination efforts with another free full-text special issue on Health Literacy to be published by the Journal of Health Communication. We also will improve the meeting's Website so that it can serve as a public resource for sharing information about health literacy measurement tools.

"TRIAD-2 Center for Health Disparities Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   AIM Goals of the P20 Teamwork in Research and Intervention to Alleviate Disparities (TRIAD-2) Center of Excellence In Health Disparities Research continuation are to strengthen and expand our capacity to conduct family based clinical trial intervention studies, train health disparity researchers, engage the community In research, health literacy, and science education, and achieve outcomes that are translatable and transferable to, by, and for the community to reduce HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and related risk factors among African Americans, Hispanics, rural and low-Income populations in North Carolina and the nation.   APPROACH We will conduct two new family based intervention studies; add formal Responsible Conduct of Research and Social Determinants training; implement new Spanish language health research education; conduct new health literacy education and evaluation; and implement new middle school student and teacher science education. Study 1 is a risky sex HIV prevention intervention with African American girls and moms. Study 2 is a lay directed intervention for Hispanic diabetics and family members. Synergistic, interdisciplinary teams will work across Administrative, Research, Research Training and Community Engagement and Outreach Dissemination Cores. NEED North Carolina and its central area specifically, have experienced great population growth (top ten states) and increased minority populations (now 34.9%, up 37% since 2000) with resulting increases in health disparities. African Americans constitute 28% of the central NC population; Hispanics have increased >500% in two decades. NC always has been the ""buckle"" of the stroke belt, and now has been designated a ""diabetes hot spot"" (lAF, March, 2011). Also, HIV rates and risks among young African American girls are alarming (NCHS, 2011). Social determinants are major factors influencing these disparities, as poverty, lack of health coverage, and low educational attainment is very high among minorities. Disparity populations' health failed to meet many 2010 national and state targets/objectives, and is worse than new national [HP2020] and state [Healthy Carolinians 2020] targets for HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and related risk factors.

"Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Mass. CHC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Massachusetts Community Health Center Abstract Health literacy, broadly defined as ""the wide range of skills and competencies"" that people use to manage their health (Zarcadoolas, et al. 2005, 196-197), is an important aspect of chronic disease self- management (Mancuso and Rincon 2006), though it has been inconsistently associated with medication adherence in multiple studies. While researchers continue to investigate the relationships among health literacy, medication adherence and health outcomes, few have successfully integrated individual-level factors such as health literacy with structural and social factors. In the proposed research, we rely on ethnographic and qualitative data, in combination with quantitative methods, to explore how medication adherence, a widespread problem in chronic disease management, is shaped by structural factors such as insurance copays, as well as by cultural health beliefs. Building on our previous research (Shaw, et al. 2012a, Shaw, et al. 2009b), the proposed study examines health literacy, health beliefs and barriers to medication adherence among patients from five ethnic groups (African-American, Hispanic, white, Vietnamese and Russian immigrant). We base this study in Massachusetts, which has recently expanded the number of people insured under publicly-funded programs while implementing cost-control measures that may limit access to prescription medications, especially for the poor. Drawing on self-report surveys, pill counts, chart review, in-depth interviews and other qualitative methods, this study will meet the following specific aims: 1. Using two different quantitative methods, to assess medication adherence among patients from 5  ethnic groups: (African-American, Hispanic, white, and Vietnamese and Russian immigrants) with  chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia); 2. Use qualitative and ethnographic methods to explore the chronic disease health beliefs that may combine with health literacy to shape medication adherence; 3. To identify factors associated with medication adherence among patients with low health literacy, including:  a. beliefs about medicines; b. food insecurity; c. socioeconomic factors (e.g., type of health insurance coverage; formulary changes); and d. social support. 4. To develop recommendations for primary care providers and policymakers to improve medication adherence and mitigate formulary changes among low-income patients with chronic illness. The unique constellation of conditions in Massachusetts-of near-universal insurance coverage coupled with stringent cost control measures as the state struggles to balance its budget-offers an unmatched research opportunity and serves as a critical bellwether for coming changes facing other states with the advent of the Affordable Care Act. The diverse population of patients served by Caring Health Center, the proposed research site, provides a natural laboratory in which to explore the effects of these policy changes as they intersect with culturally variable health beliefs to shape medication adherence among urban, minority and low-income patients. Improved understanding of these complex dynamics will better prepare primary health care providers to improve adherence and help reduce stroke risk among patients with hypertension and other chronic conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Massachusetts Community Health Center Project Narrative Health literacy plays a pivotal role in shaping the course of chronic disease, including health status, disease severity and patient adherence with prescribed medications. Urban, minority and low-income patients are at higher risk of non adhererence to their chronic disease medication regimens. While much research has been done on patient literacy and readability of forms such as informed consent and patient education materials, fewer studies have explored the relationship between health literacy, structural factors, cultural health beliefs, and medication adherence. This study focuses on an inner-city population burdened by significant disparities in diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and obesity. Not only are Springfield residents 12- 65 percent more likely to be affected by these conditions than Massachusetts residents as a whole, but the city's Black and Latino residents are 20-65 percent more likely to be affected than their Black or Latino counterparts statewide (MDPH 2003-2007). It is well-established that regular adherence to prescribed medication can help reduce the incidence and impact of chronic disease, including stroke. Yet minority and low-income patients, in particular, face significant barriers in adhering o their medication regimens, making them less likely to benefit from available care. Study results have potential national significance, especially in the context of coming changes in the nation's health care system. As tens of millions of additional individuals gain insurance coverage, cost control measures such as formulary changes and copayment tiers will become increasingly common. The Affordable Care Act invests billions more in community health centers over the next decade, and it will become increasingly important to identify effective strategies to improve medication adherence which can be integrated into those clinics where so many of those at highest risk for obesity and chronic illness receive care. Increasing our understanding of cultural factors, including cultural health beliefs, and their relationship to medication adherence among patients with low health literacy, holds significant promise for efforts to reduce disproportionate stroke risk and mortality among minority and low- income populations.","Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Mass.

"Translating Obesity and Diabetes Prevention into the Worksite for Immigrant Popul DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and diabetes are serious health problems in the United States, with rapidly increasing prevalence and incidence over the last 10 years. National data document alarming increases in overweight and obesity, and among Latinos the prevalence is 78%, markedly higher than in the general population. An estimated 25.6 million people 20 years or older have diabetes in the U.S., with the greatest increases in prevalence among racial and ethnic minority populations, further complicated by disparities in socioeconomic status. Hispanics face a diabetes prevalence twice that of non-Hispanic whites and suffer higher rates of diabetes complications and mortality. Nationally, it is estimated that there are over 2.6 million hired farm workers in the U.S., and California is among the largest employers of these workers. In California, over 450,000 people are employed in agriculture, with more than two-thirds being of Latino ethnicity. Most are immigrants with low levels of education and many have Spanish as their only language. This population also faces issues with limited access to health care, compounded by poverty and low socioeconomic status. While intervention efforts have demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle approach promoting diet and physical activity can significantly reduce obesity and diabetes incidence, there continues to be a need for effective programs designed for underserved and immigrant populations - a sizeable proportion of the U.S. working population. The overall goal of this study is to validate the effectiveness of an obesity and diabetes intervention among low-literate immigrant farm workers. We propose that a lifestyle intervention delivered at the agricultural worksite will improve obesity and diabetes risk for employees and will prove to be cost effective for the employer. The collaboration of established investigators at UC Davis with Reiter Affiliated Companies (RAC, a large berry grower in California) and the Health Initiative of the Americas at UC Berkeley (experts in organizing health campaigns for underserved immigrant populations) creates a unique opportunity to achieve significant positive health outcomes through a total worker health approach. Our efforts will build upon two successful pilot studies conducted with RAC and will enable us to reach a larger number of people and evaluate the program's translation and sustainability potential. Successful achievement of the project goals will enable dissemination of the program to improve the health of workers via a cost effective and culturally-tailored obesity and diabetes risk factor intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interventions, such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), have demonstrated that moderate lifestyle changes can significantly reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes incidence. Our approach is to deliver a obesity and diabetes lifestyle intervention in a culturally resilient context and integrated into a workplace setting. This intervention is designed to reach farm working and other immigrant Latino workers in low-wage industries, a large and growing population with an elevated risk for obesity and diabetes in the U.S. Additionally, the project includes an economic evaluation to appraise long-term sustainability, an important consideration for employers considering health and wellness programs.",Translating Obesity

"Reducing Workplace Chemical Exposures in Nail Salon Workers using an Owner-to-Wor DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last two decades, nail salons have cropped up on nearly every major street in the nation, with California currently home to the largest number of salons and licensed nail technicians. Nail salon workers routinely handle cosmetic products that contain a multitude of hazardous compounds including carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, reproductive toxins and respiratory irritants. However, available training materials lack comprehensive information about safety precautions that salons can take to minimize chemical exposures; including recommendations for less-toxic products, improved ventilation, safe handling of toxic compounds, personal protective equipment and other administrative controls (e.g., break time outside salons). Furthermore, despite the fact that Vietnamese immigrants dominate the California workforce, training materials are not translated to fit their needs. Consequently, nail salon workers needlessly suffer a number of health problems.  We propose to conduct an owner-to-worker education intervention using Vietnamese American nail salon owners to train workers within their salons on how to reduce workplace chemical exposures. Using a group randomized controlled trial design and targeting select areas in California with a large density of nail salons, we will conduct repeated surveys and personal air sampling to evaluate changes in workplace exposure, worker knowledge, behavior, and health effects between baseline and follow-up periods. The primary hypothesis is that there will be a significantly greater reduction in measured levels of air contaminants among workers in the intervention group than in the comparison group. The specific aims are to: 1) Enhance existing workplace chemical exposure reduction (WCER) education materials and survey instruments that target Vietnamese nail salon owners and workers. 2) Implement an owner-to-worker intervention to administer the WCER education materials. 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of the owner-to-worker WCER intervention for:  a)reducing the primary outcome of measured personal levels of air contaminants (e.g., toluene,  formaldehyde, methyl methacrylate and total volatile organic compounds) in workers;  b)influencing the secondary outcomes which include: i) increasing worker knowledge of WCER; ii)  modifying behavioral and environmental factors that promote WCER; and iii) reducing work-related  health problems (e.g., acute health symptoms).  The proposed intervention study is expected to have significant public health impact by reducing workplace chemical exposures in a large, rapidly-growing and predominantly immigrant workforce that is disproportionately exposed, with a goal to ultimately reduce health disparities. The proposed study focuses on the high profile concerns of health risks from chemical exposures in the burgeoning nail salon industry, an industry dominated in California by Vietnamese immigrant workers. We will conduct an owner-to-worker education intervention using Vietnamese American nail salon owners to train their workers on how to reduce workplace chemical exposures and will evaluate changes in workplace exposure, worker knowledge, behavior, and health effects between baseline and follow-up periods using personal air monitoring measurements and administered survey information. The intervention is expected to have significant public health impact by reducing harmful workplace exposures in a large, predominantly immigrant workforce that is disproportionately exposed, and thus, ultimately designed to reduce health disparities.",Reducing Workplace Chemical Exposures in Nail Salon Workers using an Owner-to-Wor,8851588,R01ES019598,"['Behavior ', ' California ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' cosmetic product ', ' Cosmetics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Equipment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Oxomethane ', ' Methyl Aldehyde ', ' Methanal ', ' Formic Aldehyde ', ' Formaldehyde ', ' Goals ', ' head ache ', ' Head Pain ', ' Cranial Pain ', ' Cephalodynia ', ' Cephalgia ', ' Cephalalgia ', ' Headache ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hybrids ', ' Industry ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Irritants ', ' Language ', ' Methacrylates ', ' Nails ', ' Nail plate ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nose ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' Throat ', ' Pharynxs ', ' Pharynx Head and Neck ', ' Pharynx ', ' Pharyngeal structure ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Poisons ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' methyl-benzene ', ' Toluene ', ' Translating ', ' Ventilation ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Social Network ', ' skin irritation ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Licensing ', ' Measurement ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' air contaminant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Occupational ', ' respiratory ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' respiratory toxin ', ' hazard ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' air monitoring ', ' air sampling ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' effectiveness research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' endocrine disrupting compound ', ' Endocrine disrupting agent ', ' Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals ', ' Endocrine Disrupter ', ' Endocrine Disruptors ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' population health ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIEHS,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2015,528948,0.06591605606772641
"Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) is a highly productive research network that is essential to advancing the science and practice of pediatric critical care medicine. The overall aim of this renewal application is for Wayne State University (WSU), under the leadership of Kathleen Meert, MD, to continue as a clinical site in the CPCCRN. Dr. Meert, PI for the CPCCRN at WSU for the past 10 years, is a pediatric intensivist with a wealth of clinical and translational research experienc and an established track record of scientific publications for the CPCCRN. Additionally, Dr. Meert has demonstrated research expertise in behavioral medicine and communication science. Strengths of WSU as a clinical site include the Children s Hospital of Michigan (CHM), a free-standing, tertiary care, academic children s hospital offering the full spectrum of pediatric and surgical subspecialty services. The PICU at CHM is a 38-bed multidisciplinary unit that cares for >1500 patients/year with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Over 85% of PICU patients have follow-up within the institution. CHM is an American College of Surgeons verified Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center and an American Burn Association verified Burn Center. Additional strengths of WSU include its vast experience with federally-funded multicenter research networks such as the Neonatal Network, Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Intervention, Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials Network, Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network, and the Children s Oncology Group. The concept proposal included in this application builds on prior CPCCRN research, led by Dr. Meert, demonstrating many challenges to achieving high quality parent-clinician communication in PICUs. High quality communication is especially important for parents with low health literacy, a key contributing factor to child health disparities. Patient- and family-centered communication (PFCC) may improve the quality of communication but depends, in part, on parents  active participation (e.g., question asking) during clinical interactions. The objective of the concept proposal is to develop a novel communication intervention, the Question Prompt Toolkit; and determine the extent to which the intervention can enhance PFCC in PICUs, and thus improve child and family outcomes. The central hypothesis is that use of the Question Prompt Toolkit will increase parents  active participation in clinical interactions, knowledge, self-efficacy and trust, reduce parent's  anxiety, and ultimately contribute to better health-related quality of life for the child and reduced family burden, especially for families with low health literacy. The hypothesis will be tested in multicenter research that pursues 2 specific aims: (1) Develop the Question Prompt Toolkit for use among parents of critically-ill children; and (2) Determine the extent to which the Question Prompt Toolkit can enhance the use of PFCC in PICUs and improve child and family outcomes. The proposal is significant because it will contribute a new communication intervention that can be applied in PICU practice to address parents'  communication needs and improve health outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The concept proposal is relevant to public health because achieving high quality healthcare communication can help to improve the problem of low health literacy. Low health literacy among parents is a key contributor to racial and ethnic disparities i child health and healthcare. Thus, the concept proposal is relevant to the NIH s mission because eliminating health disparities is a major goal of Healthy People 2020.            ",Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care

"""Don't Know"" Responses to Risk Perception Questions: Identifying Mechanisms and Solutions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strategies to change risk perceptions are a models of health decision making. Both are based on an assumption that may not always be true - that individuals know their risk for a given illness. Preliminary work from our and other laboratories has shown that a non-trivial portion of the population is uncertain about their risk for common illnesses. Moreover, we have shown that uncertainty about one's illness risk is particularly likely among U.S. populations who suffer the burden of health disparities. However, the mechanisms underlying risk uncertainty remain unknown, which limits our ability to develop effective intervention strategies to change behavior, especially in those who remain uncertain about their risk despite the wide-spread dissemination of risk-based health messaging. The objective for this R01 program of research is to explicate the mechanisms leading individuals to answer ""do not know"" in response to risk perception questions. In a program of research encompassing both observational and experimental work, we will examine how factors relating to knowledge and health literacy as well as factors related to defensive information avoidance influence do not know responding. This objective will be achieved by addressing two specific aims: 1) To explore two distinct, theoretically-informed explanations for do not know responding, and 2) To test whether experimentally manipulating the mechanisms hypothesized to cause do not know responding, reduces do not know responding. Aim 1 will be achieved with a national survey examining if low health literacy and defensive risk information avoidance are related to do not know responding to colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes risk perception items. Achieving Aim 2 will be accomplished by experimentally testing 1) whether giving do not know responders with low health literacy health messages tailored to a low health literacy audience increases risk knowledge and reduces do not know responding and 2) whether giving do not know responders who tend to avoid health information the opportunity to self-affirm prior to receiving health messages increases attending to, and comprehension of these messages and reduces do not know responding. This research is significant in that it examines a key, but understudied phenomenon related to a central decision making and behavior change construct, uncertainty about perceived risk for illness. Successful completion of the proposed research will generate tested strategies for developing more effective behavior change messages for individuals who are uncertain about their risk for common illnesses. Given the degree to which uncertainty about illness risk is more common in groups experiencing health disparities populations, our work has the potential to address behavior change factors that contribute to these ongoing health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will explore reasons why a significant proportion of people do not know their risk for two highly preventable diseases, type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer, despite the proliferation of risk-based prevention messages about these diseases. Using a two-part strategy, we will collect observational evidence and experimental evidence for the pathways underlying uncertainty about risk. The latter will also serve to test strategies for decreasing uncertainty about illness risk.            ","""Don't Know"" Responses to Risk Perception Questions: Identifying Mechanisms and Solutions",8945410,R01CA197351,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Laboratories ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Solutions ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Respondent ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' behavior change ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' risk perception ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment adherence ', ' ']",NCI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2015,362119,0.07692571297827129
"Refining Conceptual Models for the Role of Health Literacy in Health Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite more than two decades of health literacy research, causal pathways linking health literacy to health outcomes have not been well-defined. The result has been continued controversy in the concept's definition and less-informed interventions attempting to either promote clear, actionable health communication or reduce literacy disparities in healthcare with variable success. The lead investigators (Paasche-Orlow & Wolf) have previously proposed a conceptual framework for health literacy.  While it has been frequently cited in the literature, there have been limited opportunities to test and refine the underlying premises. Indeed, no conceptual model of health literacy to date has been empirically tested. Leveraging several unique and large datasets that include an expanse of relevant covariates, we propose rigorous secondary analyses to investigate proposed causal pathways linking health literacy to health outcomes including intermediary chronic disease outcomes, quality of life, hospitalization and mortality risk.  In addition, we will specifically examine how health literacy may potentially serve a mediating role and in part explain certain known health disparities.  Associations between low health literacy and worse outcomes will be mostly explained by inadequate knowledge, self-efficacy, services use, and self-care behavior. Low health literacy, numeracy, problem-solving, and knowledge with health behaviors will represent significant mediators of the relationship between race/ethnicity and worse clinical outcomes. Seven unique and diverse datasets in which the most common measures used in health literacy research (REALM, TOFHLA, NVS, others) and a rich array of additional key variables were measured. Structural equation modeling, meditational and meta-analytic techniques to determine causal pathways linking health-related literacy, numeracy, problem-solving, and knowledge with health behaviors, outcomes, and disparities will be used. Chronic disease (HbA1c, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, asthma control) functional health status and quality of life cognitive function risk of hospitalization and mortality.  The outcomes are an improved understanding of the causal mechanisms linking health literacy to health outcomes and the role of health literacy in explaining health disparities. This will be the most extensive investigation of its kind, and will significantly contribute to our understanding of the important factors inherent in defining health literacy and how best to respond to the problem. We will disseminate our findings on a Web site to promote transparency and allow continued modification of the model as further data become available. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Researchers over the past several years have produced an unprecedented number of studies demonstrating very strong associations between low 'health literacy' and poor health outcomes. There have been many attempts to respond to the problem, but very few have been successful and those that have worked were multi- faceted strategies wherein the actual cause for any improvement was not clear. We will use rigorous analytic methods to refine conceptual models linking health literacy to health outcomes.  Improving our understanding of causal pathways will reveal the true targets for intervention, allowing for more effective solutions to mitigate the problem of low health literacy and potentially reduce disparities.",Refining Conceptual Models for the Role of Health Literacy in Health Outcomes,8892231,R01HL116630,"['Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Solutions ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' catalyst ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' wasting ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Wolves ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' health knowledge ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' Services ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' mathematical ability ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Collection ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Modification ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NHLBI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,230621,0.2308604258787388
"Coccidioidomycosis Among California Hispanic Farm Workers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coccidioidomycosis is an important infectious health risk in California, especially in the dry San Joaquin Valley, which is a major center of agricultur. Caused by the soil-dwelling fungus Coccidioides immitis, exposure and infection may occur when high winds or human activity (e.g., agriculture, construction) aerosolize dust and infectious spores. High endemicity for Coccidioides immitis in California's San Joaquin Valley is of special concern because of the region's agricultural importance. Persons of Hispanic ancestry predominate among the agricultural labor force and are at increased risk for disseminated disease. Whereas agriculture has long been recognized for increased risk for coccidioidomycosis, studies have lacked precision for identifying high-risk crops or tasks. Moreover, there is little information on the knowledge levels and understanding of coccidioidomycosis among agricultural workers. The proposed work will contribute to the overall goal of reducing coccidioidomycosis in agricultural workers by (1) conducting a survey to assess knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors regarding coccidioidomycosis among 100 agricultural workers in Kern County, California, a highly endemic area; (2) conducting a case-control study (100 cases, 100 controls) to identify crops and agricultural work activities associated with coccidioidomycosis; (3) exploratory sampling of respirable dusts for Coccidioides, and (4) initiating work on translational preventive and educational programs designed to reduce the burden of coccidioidomycosis. Cross-sectors: while focused on the Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing sector, the proposed work addresses several of NIOSH's 24 industrial cross-sectors. These include Communication and Information Dissemination (through assessment of knowledge and development of educational prevention programs), Exposure Assessment (through innovative measurements Coccidioides in respirable dusts), Occupational Health Disparities (through a focus on farm workers, predominantly Hispanic, at increased risk for coccidioidomycosis), and Respiratory Diseases (through the focus on coccidioidomycosis). Expected outcomes and outputs: The major immediate outcome from the proposed work is improved understanding regarding (1) knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors relevant to coccidioidomycosis and (2) high-risk circumstances (i.e., crops and activities) among agricultural workers. Findings will be used to develop prevention programs (output) and lead to exposure reduction (intermediate outcome) to ultimately facilitate lowering of the health burden of coccidioidomycosis in agricultural workers (end outcome). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) is a lung infection caused by the soil-dwelling fungus, Coccidioides immitis, which is common in California's San Joaquin Valley and parts of the Southwest. Farm workers are at increased risk, as are persons of Hispanic, Filipino, and African- American ancestry. This study aims to assess knowledge about coccidioidomycosis among farm workers and identify high-risk work activities; this information will be used to develop preventive and educational programs to reduce the health burden of coccidioidomycosis in agricultural workers.",Coccidioidomycosis Among California Hispanic Farm Workers,8922828,U01OH010839,[''],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2015,407208,0.06654848877712695
"EFFECTS OF HEALTH LITERACY ON HEALTH DISPARITIES IN HIV CLINICAL OUTCOMES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. Although they comprise only 13% of the US population, African Americans account for nearly half of the people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. As compared to other races/ethnicities, African Americans with HIV/AIDS have shorter survival times and more deaths (CDC, 2009). Although a number of factors are associated with these disparities, clear underlying causes remain elusive.  Moreover, African Americans and other racial/ethnic minorities are at heightened risk for low health literacy. Low health literacy among African American AIDS patients has been implicated as a contributing factor to disparities in medication adherence. An important component of traditionally defined adherence (pill- taking frequency), is medication management or ""concordance"" between patient and provider regarding a medication regimen. Concordance includes correct pill identification, comprehension of the number of doses/pills per day and the timing of doses as well as accurate interpretation of warning labels, food intake instructions. Our team found that poorer management (concordance) of a simulated HIV regimen among African Americans was mediated by low health literacy and numeracy (Waldrop-Valverde et al., 2010). Although there has been a proliferation of studies on the effects of poor adherence on clinical outcomes in HIV patients, comparatively little study has been conducted on the relationship of concordance to HIV clinical outcomes. Support for the importance of disentangling adherence from concordance is emerging among other health conditions (e.g., anticoagulation control, diabetes) and vulnerable populations (e.g. elderly). To our knowledge, however, no studies have tested medication discordance as a cause of disparate health outcomes.  Medication discordance may go unnoticed in routine clinical practice since adherence assessment is often limited to only measures of dosing frequency. Therefore, the magnitude of the problem of medication discordance in HIV is not well understood nor how it may impact disease progression and clinical outcomes. We suggest that medication discordance may be a root cause of health disparities among African Americans with HIV/AIDS and propose to test the hypothesis that low health literacy leads to medication discordance and, subsequently, to poorer HIV-related clinical outcomes for African American HIV/AIDS patients. As part of our primary model testing health numeracy/literacy mediated medication management and clinical outcomes, we will also include additional patient and system contributors to health disparities from medical sociological literature to develop a comprehensive model that represents the complex interaction of risk and protective factors for those with limited health literacy. Study aims will be tested in a sample of 600 HIV/AIDS patients stratified by race/ethnicity and followed for 6 months. Although a number of studies have examined underlying causes and associated risks for disparate disease outcomes among African Americans, far fewer studies have investigated the role of health literacy and specific health-promoting behaviors on health disparities, within the context of broader social, structural and economic realities. Through its innovative approach, this study will demonstrate the effect of poor functional health literacy on disparate health outcomes and improve conceptual knowledge of health literacy in relation to other individual and contextual variables that also shape disparities. Eliminating health disparities is a primary goal of the DHHS and this highly significant study will directly impact efforts to improve parity among our most vulnerable populations.",EFFECTS OF HEALTH LITERACY ON HEALTH DISPARITIES IN HIV CLINICAL OUTCOMES,8882081,R01MH092284,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Anticoagulation ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' parity ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Medication Management ', ' Comprehension ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' American ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' mathematical ability ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Pill ', ' pill (pharmacologic) ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Disease Marker ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' diabetes control ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,509531,0.18547104823280447
"Characterization of Heat-Related Illness in Central Florida Farmworkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the earth's surface warms, heat-related illness (HRI) is emerging as a serious threat to public health. Certain occupational groups are at an increased risk for HRI, including agricultural workers. Routine work in these hazardous occupational settings without adequate respite may lead to progression down the HRI cascade, ranging from heat cramps to multi-organ failure in extreme cases. Some subpopulations of agricultural workers are at particular high risk if excessively high levels of humidity and low airflow characterize their work environments, circumventing the body's traditional heat regulatory mechanisms. These work conditions challenge the body's capacity to adapt and may lead to more rapid progression down the HRI cascade, potentiating the risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality.  The goal of this exploratory research is to characterize the work environment of agricultural workers in the state of Florida and explore the relationships between personal factors and physiologic responses to heat stress in their work environment. A total of 60 Spanish-speaking, agricultural workers in Central Florida will be recruited to 1) characterize the occupational environment of these workers 2) characterize their physiologic responses to heat stress; 3) document self-reported HRI symptoms; and 4) assess work practices and work intensity. Three types of agricultural workers will be sampled: 1) fernery workers, 2) crop workers, and 3) nursery workers. It is hypothesized that fernery workers who are protected from direct sun, but who experience a hot, high humidity environment will have higher levels of uncompensated heat stress when compared to workers in nursery operations or in open crop fields. Knowledge about agricultural work practices, individual risk factors and physiologic responses to work in hazardous extreme heat environments will help direct heat prevention strategies and decrease heat-related health disparities in this vulnerable population. Results from this study will also expand HRI knowledge and contribute to interventions for other vulnerable working populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Now and in the future, global warming will continue to be a persistent public health threat affecting all living spaces, including those where we live and work. More research is warranted to characterize and quantify the extent of heat as an occupational hazard to inform relevant public health interventions that protect vulnerable populations. Occupational study on extreme heat exposure, adaptation, and health vulnerability in farmworkers working in a high-heat region of the country, we can better assess heat stress response and sensitivity to health impacts among those integral to ensuring the food security of this nation.            ",Characterization of Heat-Related Illness in Central Florida Farmworkers,8762262,F31NR014611,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Body Composition ', ' Charge ', ' Clothing ', ' Dizziness ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heating ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Humidity ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Occupational Groups ', ' Nausea ', ' Nurseries ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' Perception ', ' Plants ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' solar radiation ', ' Solar Energy ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Occupational Safety and Health Administration ', ' United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Heat Cramp ', ' Latino ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Shelter facility ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' Surface ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Death Rate ', ' Hazard Management ', ' Global Warming ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' agriculture worker ', ' Agricultural Workers ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' heat-related illness ', ' Heat Stress Syndromes ', ' Heat Stress ', ' Heat Stress Disorders ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Exposure to ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' General farm worker NOS ', ' occupational hazard ', ' sun ', ' The Sun ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Country ', ' Occupational ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Organ failure ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Skin ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' Address ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' solar exposure ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' Symptoms ', ' Harvest ', ' Intake ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' working group ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' food security ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' operation ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,43120,0.0381233513233525
"Mechanisms of Health Literacy and Information Accessibility in the Deaf Project Summary Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users are nearly seven times more likely to have inadequate health literacy when compared with their hearing peers. This population is the non-English speaking minority group at greatest risk for miscommunication in health care settings. Health literacy mechanisms for Deaf individuals remain poorly understood, thereby limiting interventions to address health literacy disparities and their impact on health care. It is unclear how differences in attitudes, knowledge, and skills related to health information affect health literacy in Deaf populations and how they may contribute to ongoing health inequities. The two primary objectives of this proposal are: 1) to elucidate the role of information marginalization on health literacy in Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users and 2) to better understand the mechanisms of health literacy in this population so as to identify viable targets for future health literacy intervention development. This proposal is responsive to PAR-10-133's request for studies that assess mechanisms underlying health literacy, including roles of cognition, culture, language fluency, and information-seeking and interpretation ability in the deaf population and, how these may differ from the hearing population. To meet the study objectives, we will employ an explanatory sequential mixed methods design using extensive quantitative data collection procedures, namely, cross-sectional surveys and measures that will identify predictors and moderators of health literacy with 450 Deaf and 450 hearing subjects across three geographically diverse sites. These results will inform the subsequent qualitative assessment that will help explain the quantitative results, and elucidate how and why Deaf individuals access and understand health information. We will incorporate cutting edge technology to assess health information-seeking and interpretation patterns in this population, in addition to using a variety of validated and ASL -accessible instruments to assess health literacy and other constructs related to health literacy. The diverse team, consisting of both leading deaf and hearing researchers, provides a unique insight into how health information is distributed and disseminated visually. This approach has the potential to generate rich data on how to formulate health information and health literacy interventions for individuals with hearing loss. Public Health Relevance (Project Narrative) The public health impact of this study is its ability to understand potential differences in attitudes, knowledge, and skills related to health information between deaf and hearing populations and their degree of impact on health literacy. This research will assist us with improving existing health literacy interventions and tailor future approaches suitable to address the ongoing health inequities seen in the deaf population.",Mechanisms of Health Literacy and Information Accessibility in the Deaf,9053112,R01DC014703,"['Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' health attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Deafness ', ' Knowledge acquisition ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Reading ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' American Sign Language ', ' Sign Language ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Staging ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' health knowledge ', ' Formulation ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' Persons With Hearing Impairments ', ' Hard of Hearing Persons ', ' Deaf ', ' Hearing Impaired Persons ', ' meetings ', ' visual learning ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,695978,0.2447143757633736
"Using Innovative Communication Technology to Improve the Health of Young African     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite over thirty years of research and policy work, Black women are approximately twice as likely to deliver a preterm infant as white women. The current project is part of a new effort to focus on engaging young women before they become pregnant - a concept called preconception care. Simply, healthy women are more likely to have healthy babies. Intervention. This study is the first to examine the effectiveness of an innovative health communication system (Gabby) that provides preconception health care across 12 domains of health and utilizes advanced capabilities to remain current through story-telling functionality, and scales the intervention to a large number of women via its social marketing applications. Methods: A two-armed randomized controlled trial of African American women ages 18-25 recruited through community-based organizations. Both groups will undergo a comprehensive preconception health risk assessment. The intervention group will then receive the Gabby intervention. The control group will be sent a list of health risks generated by the health risk assessment. Outcomes: At twelve months, we will measure improvement in health risks. Secondary outcomes include measurement of usage rates, dose of exposure, attrition, patient and health worker and subject satisfaction, number of women with a personalized health plan, and timeliness of response. Sub analyses include the impact of perceived societal stress and health literacy on outcomes. Significance: The potential to create a low-cost, user-friendly, culturally competent, evidence-based, scalable intervention that is continuously refreshed (via the story telling function) and can be used across a range of health care, educational and community settings to improve the health of young African American women.          In an effort to address health disparities in birth outcomes for African American women, this research aims to translate evidence-based preconception care guidelines into the clinical setting. Our computer-based intervention has the ability to provide standardized, comprehensive preconception care that is patient-centered and culturally competent. If proven effective, this intervention could be used by all women and adapted to other high-risk populations, with the goal of reducing disparities in newborn morbidity and mortality.

"Care2bWell: A Worksite Physical Activity & Wellness Program for Child Care Staff DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are approximately 1.3 million US child care workers, most of who are hourly employees and classified as low-wage earners. In North Carolina, half of these workers are African American or Hispanic. Many have no health insurance, putting them at increased risk for many serious and chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Regular physical activity (PA) is known to decrease risk of many chronic diseases; unfortunately, most Americans, especially low-income individuals and minorities, fail to meet PA recommendations. A multi-level worksite-based PA intervention offered in child care is an innovative strategy to reach these low wage workers and address health disparities among this high-risk population. While the primary target of our intervention is worker PA, we expect that healthier and more physically active workers will be better role models and promoters of healthy lifestyles for children in their care. This two-arm, cluster RCT (n=104 centers, with 4 workers/center) will test the efficacy of a 6-month Care2bWell (CARE) intervention in increasing workers' PA compared to a Financial Empowerment (FE) control arm. The CARE intervention will include a kick-off workshop, where participants get tailored feedback about their health risks and set behavioral goals, followed by three 2-month long wellness campaigns, during which workers monitor PA, receive tailored feedback, and compete in teams for prizes. Center directors will take part in monthly webinars focused on improving the work environment to support PA and wellness. Within a social ecological framework, Perceptual Control, Social Support, and Diffusion of Innovation theories guide intrapersonal, interpersonal, and center- level intervention components. Participants in the FE arm will receive a parallel intervention to enhance financial health at the individual and center levels. The primary outcome will be accelerometer-measured minutes of moderate to vigorous PA. Primary and secondary outcomes (diet, anthropometrics, psychosocial variables, & center wellness environments) will be assessed at baseline, follow-up (6 mo), and maintenance (18 mo). Detailed process evaluation, cost-effectiveness, and meditational analysis will be used to assess mechanisms of behavior change at the individual and center levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: People who work in lower paying jobs without health insurance, such as child care workers, are at increased risk for many chronic diseases (obesity, heart disease, diabetes). Physical activity can help reduce risk for most of these conditions. A multi-level, child care-based, worksite wellness intervention could be an effective strategy for reaching this high risk population of low-wage workers.

"Reducing Cancer Health Disparities in Navajo Nation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are disproportionately affected by many health disparities, including the lowest cancer survival rates of any racial group in the United States. Cancers that could have been prevented or detected through screening are often diagnosed in late stages, contributing to excess mortality. Therefore, in order to address cancer disparities in Indian Country, more focus must be placed raising awareness about cancer prevention and early detection. The COPE (Community Outreach and Patient Empowerment) Project provides training and evidence-based, culturally-informed educational materials to community health workers as a means to raise health literacy and reduce health disparities in Native communities. The COPE Project has partnered with the American Cancer Society (ACS) to provide cancer- specific training for community health workers in Navajo Nation and now seeks to adapt and disseminate the ACS's cancer curriculum using interactive information technology with the goal of improving prevention and early detection activities. Engaging, easy-to-use technology will be designed for hand-held devices to offer users tailored health education. We will evaluate characteristics and patterns of community users, when delivered passively (self-use by community member) or mediated by a community health worker. We will also evaluate the impact of the system on technology literacy and cancer awareness among community health workers and community members. In addition, we will develop a web-based training portal to disseminate the training and curriculum to other Native communities. We will evaluate competency among community health workers trained through in-person and virtual sessions to assess whether virtual training can provide an effective and efficient medium to disseminate curricula broadly across community health workers serving multiple communities. We will conduct this study in close collaboration with the Navajo Nation Division of Health, New Mexico Department of Health, and the Navajo Area Indian Health Service. This 3-year project will employ a community-based participatory feedback approach to develop, implement, and evaluate an online patient-centered cancer curriculum. This approach could have a meaningful public health impact and offer a new approach for the use of technological education tools in rural, underserved populations by leveraging existing curriculum and resources to deliver culturally sensitive and relevant education in a collaborative manner.             This approach could have a meaningful public health impact and offer a new approach for the use of technological education tools in rural, underserved populations by leveraging existing curriculum and resources to deliver culturally sensitive and relevant education in a collaborative manner.",Reducing Cancer Health Disparities in Navajo Nation,8899964,G08LM012143,"['Affect ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Arizona ', ' Awareness ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Community Workers ', ' web-based training ', ' web-based instruction ', ' virtual learning ', ' virtual education ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' online learning ', ' online education ', ' multimedia learning ', ' internet-based training ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' eLearning ', ' digital education ', ' computer-based training ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' E-learning ', ' Counseling ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Hospitals ', ' literacy ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' New Mexico ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Utah ', ' Woman ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' United States Indian Health Service ', ' Indian Health Service ', ' Mediating ', ' Trainers Training ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Death Rate ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Navajo ', ' Navaho ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Training and Education ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer education ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Educational Materials ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Community Health ', ' health literacy ', ' virtual ', ' Information Technology ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' tribal communities ', ' tribal community ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' ']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,G08,2015,96559,0.05520020271957583
"Health Literacy-Disparities and transition in teens with special healthcare needs Nearly 20 percent of U.S. adolescents have special health care needs that require health or health-related  services beyond that required by children generally. During adolescence, these youths begin the transition  from parental management to self-management of their health and healthcare and from pediatric to adult care  providers. Health literacy is an important tool in this transition but little is known about patterns of health literacy  in adolescents with special healthcare needs and its importance in self care. Our long-term goal is to improve  the quality of pediatric healthcare and to reduce health disparities through innovative approaches to adolescent  care. The objective of this study is to conduct a large-scale study of health literacy and health outcomes in  teens with special health care needs. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) Identify mediators and moderators of  racial disparity in health literacy in adolescents with special health care needs. Relationships tested will include  primary language spoken at home, rural/urban residence, and parental education; 2) Assess the relationship  between adolescent health literacy, parent health literacy and effective planning for the healthcare transition  from adolescence to adulthood; and 3) Assess the relationship between adolescent health literacy, parent  health literacy, and adolescent health indicators including health-related quality of life and healthcare  utilization. To accomplish these aims we will recruit 600 dyads of a teen, age 15-17, with special health care  needs and a custodial parent from enrollees in a large, diverse Medicaid managed care plan serving central  and southwestern Ohio. Participating teens and parents will independently complete assessments of  demographics, child health-related quality of life, functional health literacy, medical home status, and  healthcare transition planning. Health care utilization information in the year following the initial assessment will  be measured using administrative encounter data. Analyses will test the hypotheses that racial disparities exist  in health literacy and that disparities are mediated by parental education and other variables. We will also test  the hypothesis that disparities in health literacy are associated with disparities in transition planning and  inappropriate health services use. Results from this project will be used to design interventions that improve  the healthcare transition process and health services use by expressly addressing issues of health literacy and  to inform health care providers, payors, public health professionals, and policy-makers of the extent and  predictors of health literacy limitations and of the health and social costs associated with limited health literacy  in this population. One in six US teens has a special healthcare need that causes them to use more healthcare services than  other youths their age. These youths and their families need health literacy skills to navigate the  healthcare system. This study measures the presence of racial and socio-demographic disparities in  health literacy and tests whether limitation in health literacy are a barrier to the transition to adult care.",Health Literacy-Disparities and transition in teens with special healthcare needs,8889533,R01MD007160,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Resources ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Language ', ' literacy ', ' Medicaid ', ' Ohio ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Managed Care ', ' Mediating ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Self Management ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residence ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Funding ', ' Physician-Hospital Organizations ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Services ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Preparation ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' ']",NIMHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R01,2015,290001,0.1887370195309214

"Training At-Risk Industrial, Telecommunication and Immigrant Workers on How to Protect Themselves from Exposure to Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Products ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Steelworkers Charitable and Educational Organization (SCEO), the non-profit (501c3) arm of the United Steelworkers (USW), is applying for HWWTP, HDPTP and ECWTP funds to support a training partnership linking two of the largest U.S.-based industrial unions with rapidly expanding immigrant worker centers. The Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC), the SCEO's training entity, brings together the USW, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the Labor Institute (LI), and the National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON) and Make the Road New York (MRNY). In the next five years through these three submissions, the TMC will provide more than 65,000 workers and community residents with over 950,000 hours of training to help prevent toxic releases, fires, explosions, injuries, sickness and death. Through our proposed HWWTP five-year program, we will conduct 2,745 courses that will reach 55,950 workers, managers and community residents with 633,700 hours of training. To prevent fatalities, injuries, illnesses and releases of hazardous substances, we will focus WTP training and mentoring on H&S committee members and other activists who are in a position to help achieve concrete and lasting institutional changes at hundreds of U.S. worksites and communities. For our worker center partners, the focus will be on building a robust and widely dispersed H&S training capacity (in English and Spanish) for immigrant day-laborers and temporary workers who face a myriad of hazards on their ever-shifting worksites. The HDPTP program will establish a multi-lingual team of trainers (Specialized Emergency Response Trainers - SERTs) who are prepared to go anywhere at any time to provide training to emergency response and clean-up workers and community members engaged in massive man-made or weather-related disasters. To achieve this goal will dramatically increase the supply of Spanish language OSHA-certified Master Trainers who can conduct the full-range of HWWTP-related OSHA courses. We also will establish a SERTs infectious diseases working group to provide training expertise on donning and doffing high-level protective clothing and the proper use of related equipment to protect health care and hazardous waste workers. Our HDPTP program will offer 400 classes that will provide 9,050 at-risk workers and community residents with 119,000 contact hours. In the ECWTP program we will support and enhance workforce development programs conducted by MRNY in Queens and Brooklyn, NY, and the A. Philip Randolph Institute (APRI) in Pittsburgh, PA to place unemployed and underemployed workers in decent-paying occupations in construction, environmental cleanup and other green jobs. After providing 15 weeks of training for up to 450 workers over the term of the award, we will place at least 75 percent of these participants in good green jobs. Target Populations: The TMC has access to over 1.2 million USW/CWA workers and managers at facilities located in each U.S. state as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. They work in oil, chemical manufacturing, nuclear energy, pharmaceuticals, pulp, paper, automobile parts, appliance manufacturing, cement, metal manufacturing, construction, rubber, plastics, shipbuilding, light manufacturing, telecommunications, transportation, electrical manufacturing and health care. Approximately 850,000 of these workers are potentially exposed to hazardous substances covered by OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910, EPA 40 CFR 311, and DOT 49 CFR 171-177. The day laborers and temporary workers we will reach are employed in virtually every kind of clean-up activity, especially during emergencies, in addition to construction, car washes, cleaning, home care, warehousing and distribution. MRNY has over 16,000 members at its centers in New York in Bushwick, Jackson Heights, Port Richmond, Midland Beach, and Brentwood, Long Island. It is opening new centers in NJ, CT and PA. NDLON is a network of 45 day-laborer organizations in fifteen states and it estimates that approximately 5,000 workers pass through its centers nationwide each day.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 300 worker-trainers from the United Steelworkers (USW), the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), and Make the Road New York (MRNY) will provide hazardous waste training to front-line workers, communities and other-stakeholders in order to protect the worker health and safety, the public's health, and the environment. The workers we represent, who produce, dispose of, and transport billions of pounds of hazardous substances and wastes, will receive HAZWOPER and related OSHA training. Our combined HWWTP, HDPTP and ECWTP proposed five-year programs will conduct over 3,300 classes for 65,000 workers and residents, providing more than 900,000 hours of training.            ","Training At-Risk Industrial, Telecommunication and Immigrant Workers on How to Protect Themselves from Exposure to Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Products",8960547,U45ES006175,"['Academy ', ' Americas ', ' Automobiles ', ' Award ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' C element ', ' Carbon ', ' Chemistry ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Workers ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' pulp ', ' Dental Pulp ', ' Disasters ', ' Dust ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Environment and Public Health ', ' Equipment ', ' Explosion ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Hazardous Chemicals ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Waste ', ' Health ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mentors ', ' Metals ', ' New York ', ' Atomic Energy ', ' Nuclear Energy ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Oils ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Paper ', ' Plastics ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Poisons ', ' Program Development ', ' Protective Clothing ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Risk ', ' natural Rubber ', ' Latex Rubber ', ' Rubber ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' statistics ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telecommunications ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Transportation ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Virgin Islands ', ' United States Virgin Islands ', ' Waste Products ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' underemployed ', ' Underemployment ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Killings ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' patient home care ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' news ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Country ', ' Height ', ' Occupational ', ' meetings ', ' hazard ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' nanotech ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' nano scale Science ', ' Nanoscale Science ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' Committee Members ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' working group ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' resilience ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' community organizations ', ' Long Island ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' Toxics Release Inventory ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIEHS,STEELWORKER CHARITABLE/EDUCATIONAL ORG,U45,2015,2172545,0.06766243852285567

"""The Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Communities Worker Health and Safety Training Program"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Dillard University Deep South Center for Environmental Justice hazardous Waste Worker Training Center provides training to hazardous material and waster workers who may perform jobs covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standards and assist employers with complying with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120. The Consortium's goal is unique in that its emphasis is on underserved populations in both its Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program (HWWTP) and its Environmental Careers Worker Training Program (ECWTP).  The proposed HWWTP component has been designed to provide model occupational safety and health training for workers who are or may be engaged in activities related to hazardous waste removal, containment or chemical response. The emphasis however, is on servicing workers of entities where health and safety training is critical to the worker's wellbeing and possibly the safety and health of the public, but due to circumstances beyond the individual worker's control, (s)he is unlikely to receive sufficient training at either the quality or quantity needed to ensure safety and health. Such entities include emergency responders and city workers in small municipalities and or cities where budgeting restraints or working conditions (such as no release time), greatly reduces or eliminates the possibility of training.

"Health Literacy Assessment and Intervention to Reduce Disparities: FLIGHT/VIDAS II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is a critically important skill that helps people to become active participants in their health care. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy showed that more than 75 million Americans had basic health literacy skills, indicating that as many as 1 in 4 Americans can have difficulty understanding information about their healthcare. Persons in racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have even lower levels of health literacy. Twenty-four percent of blacks (9.5 million persons) and 41% of Hispanics (21 million persons) have below basic levels of health literacy. These persons have lower levels of health literacy and compelling evidence, including our own findings (see below), link race and ethnicity to disparities in health via health literacy. Members of minority groups and older adults are more frequently affected by chronic diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, asthma, hepatitis C, HIV infection, mental health disorders and many others. The twin burdens of chronic disease and low levels of health literacy thus fall disproportionately on those most in need - members of minorities and older adults, all of whom likely to experience one or more chronic conditions while often not having the health literacy skills to help them cope.  Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a logical target for a general health literacy intervention. In an approach that cuts across specific diseases. CDSM targets problems and skills needed to cope with issues such as fatigue, pain, stress, depression, sleep disturbance and treatment adherence. Studies show that in- person CDSM classes improve patients' functioning and reduce healthcare utilization, but their availability is limited due to the lack of qualified personnel and cost. Similarly, while interventions have been developed to improve health literacy, they are difficult to scale to levels needed to meet the challenge of low health literacy (for more than 40 million persons) due to their cost. Effective interventions with the potential for wider dissemination at reasonable costs are urgently needed.  In a previous study, we showed that a computer-delivered tailored information intervention targeting health literacy that can deployed either as an information kiosk in a clinical office or n the Internet could be cost- effective in improving patients' health literacy and adherence. It is nt clear, however, whether the same sort of computer-delivered, multimedia and interactive approach will be effective in improving CDSM skills in persons with low baseline levels of health literacy, and if it is, whether its effects will extend beyond health literacy to general health, slf-efficacy, activation, and treatment adherence. In a second project period we will evaluate this possibility by creating a personally relevant computer-delivered intervention targeting CDSM and health literacy among African-Americans, Hispanics, and white non-Hispanics: PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving patient health literacy through their chronic disease management skills and knowledge may be an effective strategy reducing health disparities. In this project we will build on our work in health literacy and computer-delivered interventions to create a new intervention to reduce health disparities by improving health literacy and chronic disease management among African-American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic whites.",Health Literacy Assessment and Intervention to Reduce Disparities: FLIGHT/VIDAS II,9130379,R56HL096578,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Cholesterol ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Computers ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hepatitis ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' literacy ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Persons ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Stress ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' interactive multimedia ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' mathematical ability ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Age-Years ', ' Qualifying ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' information kiosk ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment adherence ', ' tablet device ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' ']",NHLBI,NOVA SOUTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R56,2015,569078,0.24356671667750518
"Health Literacy and Health Disparities Among the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career development award proposes a program of training, data collection  and research to advance knowledge in the area of health literacy and health disparities  among the elderly.  Specifically, the aims of this project are (1) to understand the  relationship between measures health literacy and more general measures of cognition,  such as memory and numeracy; (2) to estimate the relationship between health literacy,  general cognition and health outcomes in a large and nationally-representative sample  of older Americans; (3) to analyze the mechanisms through which health literacy and  cognition affect health outcomes; (4) to analyze the role that health literacy plays in  determining health disparities across racial, ethnic or  socio-economic groups; (5) to  explore similarities and differences between the concepts of health literacy and financial  literacy, and compare the relationship between literacy and outcomes in both domains.  The research activities will be carried out through a program of primary data collection and secondary data analysis based on the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).  The primary data collection consists of a module of questions on health literacy and health knowledge to be collected from a subset of respondents to the 2010 wave of the HRS. Analysis of the data will also be carried out with guidance from an interdisciplinary team of mentors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study examines how an individual's health literacy - that is, the ability to understand and process information related to health - affects his or her health. The study focuses on how health literacy in the elderly and near-elderly population is  related to more general cognitive skills such as memory and the ability to do simple  math problems.

In the next five years through these three submissions, the TMC will provide more than 65,000 workers and community residents with over 950,000 hours of training to help prevent toxic releases, fires, explosions, injuries, sickness and death. Through our proposed HWWTP five-year program, we will conduct 2,745 courses that will reach 55,950 workers, managers and community residents with 633,700 hours of training. To prevent fatalities, injuries, illnesses and releases of hazardous substances, we will focus WTP training and mentoring on H&S committee members and other activists who are in a position to help achieve concrete and lasting institutional changes at hundreds of U.S. worksites and communities. For our worker center partners, the focus will be on building a robust and widely dispersed H&S training capacity (in English and Spanish) for immigrant day-laborers and temporary workers who face a myriad of hazards on their ever-shifting worksites. The HDPTP program will establish a multi-lingual team of trainers (Specialized Emergency Response Trainers - SERTs) who are prepared to go anywhere at any time to provide training to emergency response and clean-up workers and community members engaged in massive man-made or weather-related disasters. To achieve this goal will dramatically increase the supply of Spanish language OSHA-certified Master Trainers who can conduct the full-range of HWWTP-related OSHA courses. We also will establish a SERTs infectious diseases working group to provide training expertise on donning and doffing high-level protective clothing and the proper use of related equipment to protect health care and hazardous waste workers. Our HDPTP program will offer 400 classes that will provide 9,050 at-risk workers and community residents with 119,000 contact hours. In the ECWTP program we will support and enhance workforce development programs conducted by MRNY in Queens and Brooklyn, NY, and the A. Philip Randolph Institute (APRI) in Pittsburgh, PA to place unemployed and underemployed workers in decent-paying occupations in construction, environmental cleanup and other green jobs. After providing 15 weeks of training for up to 450 workers over the term of the award, we will place at least 75 percent of these participants in good green jobs. Target Populations: The TMC has access to over 1.2 million USW/CWA workers and managers at facilities located in each U.S. state as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. They work in oil, chemical manufacturing, nuclear energy, pharmaceuticals, pulp, paper, automobile parts, appliance manufacturing, cement, metal manufacturing, construction, rubber, plastics, shipbuilding, light manufacturing, telecommunications, transportation, electrical manufacturing and health care. Approximately 850,000 of these workers are potentially exposed to hazardous substances covered by OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910, EPA 40 CFR 311, and DOT 49 CFR 171-177. The day laborers and temporary workers we will reach are employed in virtually every kind of clean-up activity, especially during emergencies, in addition to construction, car washes, cleaning, home care, warehousing and distribution. MRNY has over 16,000 members at its centers in New York in Bushwick, Jackson Heights, Port Richmond, Midland Beach, and Brentwood, Long Island. It is opening new centers in NJ, CT and PA. NDLON is a network of 45 day-laborer organizations in fifteen states and it estimates that approximately 5,000 workers pass through its centers nationwide each day. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 300 worker-trainers from the United Steelworkers (USW), the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), and Make the Road New York (MRNY) will provide hazardous waste training to front-line workers, communities and other-stakeholders in order to protect the worker health and safety, the public's health, and the environment. The workers we represent, who produce, dispose of, and transport billions of pounds of hazardous substances and wastes, will receive HAZWOPER and related OSHA training. Our combined HWWTP, HDPTP and ECWTP proposed five-year programs will conduct over 3,300 classes for 65,000 workers and residents, providing more than 900,000 hours of training.","Training At-Risk Industrial, Telecommunication and Immigrant Workers on How to Protect Themselves from Exposure to Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Products",9343464,U45ES006175,"['Academy ', ' Americas ', ' Automobiles ', ' Award ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' C element ', ' Carbon ', ' Chemistry ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Workers ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' pulp ', ' Dental Pulp ', ' Disasters ', ' Dust ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Environment and Public Health ', ' Equipment ', ' Explosion ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Hazardous Chemicals ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Waste ', ' Health ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mentors ', ' Metals ', ' New York ', ' Atomic Energy ', ' Nuclear Energy ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Oils ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Paper ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Poisons ', ' Protective Clothing ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Risk ', ' natural Rubber ', ' Latex Rubber ', ' Rubber ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' statistics ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telecommunications ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Transportation ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States Virgin Islands ', ' Virgin Islands ', ' Waste Products ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Underemployment ', ' underemployed ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Killings ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' patient home care ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' news ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Country ', ' Height ', ' Occupational ', ' meetings ', ' hazard ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' nanotechnological ', ' nanotech ', ' nano-technological ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' Committee Members ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' resilience ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' community organizations ', ' Long Island ', ' combat ', ' Toxics Release Inventory ', ' arm ', ' Emergency response ', ' Workforce Development ', ' ']",NIEHS,STEELWORKER CHARITABLE/EDUCATIONAL ORG,U45,2016,64000,0.06766243852285567
"Health Literacy Assessment and Intervention to Reduce Disparities: FLIGHT/VIDAS II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is a critically important skill that helps people to become active participants in their health care. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy showed that more than 75 million Americans had basic health literacy skills, indicating that as many as 1 in 4 Americans can have difficulty understanding information about their healthcare. Persons in racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have even lower levels of health literacy. Twenty-four percent of blacks (9.5 million persons) and 41% of Hispanics (21 million persons) have below basic levels of health literacy. These persons have lower levels of health literacy and compelling evidence, including our own findings (see below), link race and ethnicity to disparities in health via health literacy. Members of minority groups and older adults are more frequently affected by chronic diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, asthma, hepatitis C, HIV infection, mental health disorders and many others. The twin burdens of chronic disease and low levels of health literacy thus fall disproportionately on those most in need - members of minorities and older adults, all of whom likely to experience one or more chronic conditions while often not having the health literacy skills to help them cope. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a logical target for a general health literacy intervention. In an approach that cuts across specific diseases. CDSM targets problems and skills needed to cope with issues such as fatigue, pain, stress, depression, sleep disturbance and treatment adherence. Studies show that in- person CDSM classes improve patients' functioning and reduce healthcare utilization, but their availability is limited due to the lack of qualified personnel and cost. Similarly, while interventions have been developed to improve health literacy, they are difficult to scale to levels needed to meet the challenge of low health literacy (for more than 40 million persons) due to their cost. Effective interventions with the potential for wider dissemination at reasonable costs are urgently needed. In a previous study, we showed that a computer-delivered tailored information intervention targeting health literacy that can deployed either as an information kiosk in a clinical office or n the Internet could be cost- effective in improving patients' health literacy and adherence. It is nt clear, however, whether the same sort of computer-delivered, multimedia and interactive approach will be effective in improving CDSM skills in persons with low baseline levels of health literacy, and if it is, whether its effects will extend beyond health literacy to general health, slf-efficacy, activation, and treatment adherence. In this follow-up study we will evaluate this possibility by creating a personally relevant computer-delivered intervention targeting CDSM and health literacy among African-Americans, Hispanics, and white non-Hispanics: PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving patient health literacy through their chronic disease management skills and knowledge may be an effective strategy reducing health disparities. In this project we will build on our work in health literacy and computer-delivered interventions to create a new intervention to reduce health disparities by improving health literacy and chronic disease management among African-American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic whites.

"PBS NewsHour Health Literacy and Student Reporting Labs: Broad expansion of journalism to increase bioscience literacy in America and support the next generation of biomedical science communicators ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using a combination of high quality broadcast and Web-streamed news reports on emerging public health concerns, youth-generated videos addressing health-related topics, and online curriculum resources, PBS NewsHour will engineer successful public health education experiences that engage the American public, students of all backgrounds - particularly those in underserved populations - to explore biomedical research and emerging health science information as it emerges in academic institutions, private laboratories and public health institutions throughout the country. To identify cutting edge storie of concern to the American public, PBS NewsHour will commission an annual survey of priority public health concerns and then, using that crowdsourced material, work with a blue-ribbon medical advisory council to help identify key experts and material to support in-depth journalism into those topics. The NewsHour aims to engage with the public on issues that are on their minds but then take the reporting to the next level, so that people understand not only what is at stake for them personally, but how what is happening in labs and universities translates into new advances and developments. Social media will be used both to engage with the public and to promote this content. Through this funding and using these stories produced by the award winning PBS NewsHour medical reporting team as a focus, the PBS NewsHour's Student Reporting Labs will experiment with an adaptation of its successful science program to work with eight Labs to produce unique news stories that view health science topics from a youth perspective. These videos will become part of a comprehensive set of lesson plans and learning tools disseminated online to the general public, educators and youth media organizations to draw attention to American health and biomedical issues and careers. Students will be supported with curricula and mentorship on fundamental research practice and the critical thinking skills necessary for responsible journalism. This process will ensure the next generation includes citizens who are effective health science communicators and self-motivated learners with a deep connection to the role of biomedical research in their careers and future life. Youth program resources will be posted on the PBS NewsHour Extra site to serve its 700,000 annual users and our partner sites PBS Learning Media and Share My Lesson - the two biggest free education resource sites on the web.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To increase public health literacy, all sectors of society must have access to the highest-quality health science news and information possible, suited to their learning needs, cognitive capacities, and health concerns. Translation, packaging and broad dissemination is important to this goal: the stories matter. PBS NewsHour, the most trusted news in America, is ideally positioned to raise the level of discourse and decision making around public health issues through production of targeted health news stories and emerging issues in the biomedical field. Through SEPA funding, adaptation of PBS NewsHour's Student Reporting Labs and youth mentoring program has the potential to address health disparities and science literacy deficits and to build a new cadre of minority youth and youth from low socio-economic status communities who will have the discipline, creativity and critical thinking skills needed to be successful health science-literate citizens and advocates in their communities and for their peers.            ",PBS NewsHour Health Literacy and Student Reporting Labs: Broad expansion of journalism to increase bioscience literacy in America and support the next generation of biomedical science communicators,9095813,R25OD020212,"['Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' creativity ', ' Creativeness ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Decision Making ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Engineering ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Opinion ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Medical Research ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' news ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stream ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Journalism ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' literate ', ' outreach ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Public Health Training ', ' Public Health Instruction ', ' Public Health Education ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' Advanced Development ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' fundamental research ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health priorities ', ' Critical Thinking ', ' Evaluative Thinking ', ' Complex thinking ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' online course ', ' online curriculum ', ' E-course ', ' learning outcome ', ' social media ', ' teacher community ', ' team teaching ', ' teacher collaboration ', ' ']",OD,WETA TV 26,R25,2016,270000,0.07226840212646989
"Coccidioidomycosis Among California Hispanic Farm Workers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coccidioidomycosis is an important infectious health risk in California, especially in the dry San Joaquin Valley, which is a major center of agricultur. Caused by the soil-dwelling fungus Coccidioides immitis, exposure and infection may occur when high winds or human activity (e.g., agriculture, construction) aerosolize dust and infectious spores. High endemicity for Coccidioides immitis in California's San Joaquin Valley is of special concern because of the region's agricultural importance. Persons of Hispanic ancestry predominate among the agricultural labor force and are at increased risk for disseminated disease. Whereas agriculture has long been recognized for increased risk for coccidioidomycosis, studies have lacked precision for identifying high-risk crops or tasks. Moreover, there is little information on the knowledge levels and understanding of coccidioidomycosis among agricultural workers. The proposed work will contribute to the overall goal of reducing coccidioidomycosis in agricultural workers by (1) conducting a survey to assess knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors regarding coccidioidomycosis among 100 agricultural workers in Kern County, California, a highly endemic area; (2) conducting a case-control study (100 cases, 100 controls) to identify crops and agricultural work activities associated with coccidioidomycosis; (3) exploratory sampling of respirable dusts for Coccidioides, and (4) initiating work on translational preventive and educational programs designed to reduce the burden of coccidioidomycosis. Cross-sectors: while focused on the Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing sector, the proposed work addresses several of NIOSH's 24 industrial cross-sectors. These include Communication and Information Dissemination (through assessment of knowledge and development of educational prevention programs), Exposure Assessment (through innovative measurements Coccidioides in respirable dusts), Occupational Health Disparities (through a focus on farm workers, predominantly Hispanic, at increased risk for coccidioidomycosis), and Respiratory Diseases (through the focus on coccidioidomycosis). Expected outcomes and outputs: The major immediate outcome from the proposed work is improved understanding regarding (1) knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors relevant to coccidioidomycosis and (2) high-risk circumstances (i.e., crops and activities) among agricultural workers. Findings will be used to develop prevention programs (output) and lead to exposure reduction (intermediate outcome) to ultimately facilitate lowering of the health burden of coccidioidomycosis in agricultural workers (end outcome). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) is a lung infection caused by the soil-dwelling fungus, Coccidioides immitis, which is common in California's San Joaquin Valley and parts of the Southwest. Farm workers are at increased risk, as are persons of Hispanic, Filipino, and African- American ancestry. This study aims to assess knowledge about coccidioidomycosis among farm workers and identify high-risk work activities; this information will be used to develop preventive and educational programs to reduce the health burden of coccidioidomycosis in agricultural workers.",Coccidioidomycosis Among California Hispanic Farm Workers,9110730,U01OH010839,[''],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2016,275000,0.06654848877712695
"OAI, Inc. Worker Training Program: Hazardous Waste Worker Training (HWWT) and Environmental Career Worker Training Program (ECWTP) Consortia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): OAI, a Chicago community-based agency, proposes to implement HWWT and ECWT Consortia. HWWT will target three populations: 1) underfunded rural and volunteer Emergency First Responders 2) Transitional and Temporary Workers and high school dropouts, and 3) Non Union Workers, including Hispanic hazardous waste handlers. Over 5 years, HWWT will train 23,470 students in 19 states and generate 253,660 contact hours. ECWT will assist unemployed African Americans, Hispanics, women, ex-offenders, and veterans who face multiple barriers to employment in Chicago, Dallas and Kansas City by training a total of 420 participants, placing 355 (85%) in jobs and generating 169,440-211,800 instructional contact hours. Significance: Both Consortia target the underserved and address public health disparities, prevention, and protection of workers, EJ residents and their communities from exposure to hazardous substances. ECWT responds to the underrepresentation of disadvantaged residents in the construction/environmental workforce. Leadership and Capacity: OAI has been a WTP grantee since 1995, led by the same Principal Investigator who has 32 years of experience in adult education, workforce development, and grants management. She will be supported by a team of health and safety professionals (IH, CIH) and others with requisite credentials and proven expertise. Innovation: Best practices and innovations of both Consortia include: the implementation of Social Ecological Model (SEM) and Economic Impact Study evaluation plan, integration of Climate Change and Community Resiliency into existing curricula, and Blended Learning. ECWT will continue to refine a unique Try-Outs selection process and demonstrate the Alumni Mentors retention strategy. HWWT will pilot a bilingual Train-the-Trainer model for Vietnamese nail salon workers integrating hazard awareness, SEM, 3Rs (reduction, reuse, and recycling), cultural competence, and community resiliency. Approach: HWWT will deliver direct training instruction via local peer trainers. As a strategy to build local capacity and sustainability, it will customize its Train-the-Trainer model o meet the needs of target populations. ECWT will provide Core Health & Safety Courses; Career Specific Training (Environmental/ Construction, Commercial Truck Driving/Hazmat Endorsement & Warehousing training, Water & Wastewater Operations, and Advanced Construction); Core Soft Skills Training; Supportive Services; and Career Guidance.

"""The Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Communities Worker Health and Safety Training Program"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Dillard University Deep South Center for Environmental Justice hazardous Waste Worker Training Center provides training to hazardous material and waster workers who may perform jobs covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standards and assist employers with complying with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120. The Consortium's goal is unique in that its emphasis is on underserved populations in both its Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program (HWWTP) and its Environmental Careers Worker Training Program (ECWTP).  The proposed HWWTP component has been designed to provide model occupational safety and health training for workers who are or may be engaged in activities related to hazardous waste removal, containment or chemical response. The emphasis however, is on servicing workers of entities where health and safety training is critical to the worker's wellbeing and possibly the safety and health of the public, but due to circumstances beyond the individual worker's control, (s)he is unlikely to receive sufficient training at either the quality or quantity needed to ensure safety and health. Such entities include emergency responders and city workers in small municipalities and or cities where budgeting restraints or working conditions (such as no release time), greatly reduces or eliminates the possibility of training. Volunteer fire departments and small county police forces, city health department employees, port authority workers and mosquito control division employees are examples of workers the Consortium has trained. Additionally, HBCUs with smaller budgets have been shown to receive some of the highest fines for non-compliance with applicable regulations. Small minority and disadvantaged businesses typically lack the capital to participate in high cost compliance training programs. The Consortium has targeted these entities for the proposed HWWT program.  The proposed ECWTP component has been designed to deliver comprehensive worker training to increase the number of underrepresented and disadvantaged minority adults employed in the fields of environmental restoration, hazardous materials and construction. The goals for this program are: (1) to serve underrepresented and disadvantaged adults living near hazardous waste and or contaminated property at risk of exposure to ambient hazards; and also (2) to provide additional pre-employment services that are inclusive of basic skills (i.e. study skills, math, reading, life skils) to increase program retention and completion; and (3) to successfully place trainers in jobs in the environmental restoration and construction fields. The added value of this training is not just that it increases sustainable employment opportunities for residents of beleaguered communities engulfed in situations of poverty and pollution, but that by investing in these particular individuals promotes economic stability, addresses health disparities and advances environmental justice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The HBCU and Communities Consortium Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program is uniquely designed to reach populations for training that have historically, due to poverty and or racism, been disenfranchised and excluded from opportunities existing within society. It also addresses basic inequities in resources for different communities across the country (rural vs urban) and differences in priorities for municipalities and city agencies, with training being first to be cut.

"Reducing Workplace Chemical Exposures in Nail Salon Workers using an Owner-to-Wor DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last two decades, nail salons have cropped up on nearly every major street in the nation, with California currently home to the largest number of salons and licensed nail technicians. Nail salon workers routinely handle cosmetic products that contain a multitude of hazardous compounds including carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, reproductive toxins and respiratory irritants. However, available training materials lack comprehensive information about safety precautions that salons can take to minimize chemical exposures; including recommendations for less-toxic products, improved ventilation, safe handling of toxic compounds, personal protective equipment and other administrative controls (e.g., break time outside salons). Furthermore, despite the fact that Vietnamese immigrants dominate the California workforce, training materials are not translated to fit their needs. Consequently, nail salon workers needlessly suffer a number of health problems.  We propose to conduct an owner-to-worker education intervention using Vietnamese American nail salon owners to train workers within their salons on how to reduce workplace chemical exposures. Using a group randomized controlled trial design and targeting select areas in California with a large density of nail salons, we will conduct repeated surveys and personal air sampling to evaluate changes in workplace exposure, worker knowledge, behavior, and health effects between baseline and follow-up periods. The primary hypothesis is that there will be a significantly greater reduction in measured levels of air contaminants among workers in the intervention group than in the comparison group. The specific aims are to: 1) Enhance existing workplace chemical exposure reduction (WCER) education materials and survey instruments that target Vietnamese nail salon owners and workers. 2) Implement an owner-to-worker intervention to administer the WCER education materials. 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of the owner-to-worker WCER intervention for:  a)reducing the primary outcome of measured personal levels of air contaminants (e.g., toluene,  formaldehyde, methyl methacrylate and total volatile organic compounds) in workers;  b)influencing the secondary outcomes which include: i) increasing worker knowledge of WCER; ii)  modifying behavioral and environmental factors that promote WCER; and iii) reducing work-related  health problems (e.g., acute health symptoms).  The proposed intervention study is expected to have significant public health impact by reducing workplace chemical exposures in a large, rapidly-growing and predominantly immigrant workforce that is disproportionately exposed, with a goal to ultimately reduce health disparities. The proposed study focuses on the high profile concerns of health risks from chemical exposures in the burgeoning nail salon industry, an industry dominated in California by Vietnamese immigrant workers. We will conduct an owner-to-worker education intervention using Vietnamese American nail salon owners to train their workers on how to reduce workplace chemical exposures and will evaluate changes in workplace exposure, worker knowledge, behavior, and health effects between baseline and follow-up periods using personal air monitoring measurements and administered survey information. The intervention is expected to have significant public health impact by reducing harmful workplace exposures in a large, predominantly immigrant workforce that is disproportionately exposed, and thus, ultimately designed to reduce health disparities.",Reducing Workplace Chemical Exposures in Nail Salon Workers using an Owner-to-Wor,9064148,R01ES019598,"['Behavior ', ' California ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' cosmetic product ', ' Cosmetics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Equipment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Methyl Aldehyde ', ' Oxomethane ', ' Methanal ', ' Formic Aldehyde ', ' Formaldehyde ', ' Goals ', ' head ache ', ' Head Pain ', ' Cranial Pain ', ' Cephalodynia ', ' Cephalgia ', ' Cephalalgia ', ' Headache ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hybrids ', ' Industry ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Irritants ', ' Language ', ' Methacrylates ', ' Nails ', ' Nail plate ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nose ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' Throat ', ' Pharynx ', ' Pharyngeal structure ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Poisons ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' methyl-benzene ', ' Toluene ', ' Translating ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' Ventilation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Social Network ', ' skin irritation ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Licensing ', ' Measurement ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' air contaminant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Occupational ', ' respiratory ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' respiratory toxin ', ' hazard ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' air monitoring ', ' air sampling ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' effectiveness research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' endocrine disrupting compound ', ' Endocrine disrupting agent ', ' Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals ', ' Endocrine Disrupter ', ' Endocrine Disruptors ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' population health ', ' screening ', ' trial design ', ' Diverse Workforce ', ' Workplace Diversity ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ']",NIEHS,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,515162,0.06591605606772641
"Using Innovative Communication Technology to Improve the Health of Young African DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite over thirty years of research and policy work, Black women are approximately twice as likely to deliver a preterm infant as white women. The current project is part of a new effort to focus on engaging young women before they become pregnant - a concept called preconception care. Simply, healthy women are more likely to have healthy babies. Intervention. This study is the first to examine the effectiveness of an innovative health communication system (Gabby) that provides preconception health care across 12 domains of health and utilizes advanced capabilities to remain current through story-telling functionality, and scales the intervention to a large number of women via its social marketing applications. Methods: A two-armed randomized controlled trial of African American women ages 18-25 recruited through community-based organizations. Both groups will undergo a comprehensive preconception health risk assessment. The intervention group will then receive the Gabby intervention. The control group will be sent a list of health risks generated by the health risk assessment. Outcomes: At twelve months, we will measure improvement in health risks. Secondary outcomes include measurement of usage rates, dose of exposure, attrition, patient and health worker and subject satisfaction, number of women with a personalized health plan, and timeliness of response.

"Characterization of Heat-Related Illness in Central Florida Farmworkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the earth's surface warms, heat-related illness (HRI) is emerging as a serious threat to public health. Certain occupational groups are at an increased risk for HRI, including agricultural workers. Routine work in these hazardous occupational settings without adequate respite may lead to progression down the HRI cascade, ranging from heat cramps to multi-organ failure in extreme cases. Some subpopulations of agricultural workers are at particular high risk if excessively high levels of humidity and low airflow characterize their work environments, circumventing the body's traditional heat regulatory mechanisms. These work conditions challenge the body's capacity to adapt and may lead to more rapid progression down the HRI cascade, potentiating the risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality.  The goal of this exploratory research is to characterize the work environment of agricultural workers in the state of Florida and explore the relationships between personal factors and physiologic responses to heat stress in their work environment. A total of 60 Spanish-speaking, agricultural workers in Central Florida will be recruited to 1) characterize the occupational environment of these workers 2) characterize their physiologic responses to heat stress; 3) document self-reported HRI symptoms; and 4) assess work practices and work intensity. Three types of agricultural workers will be sampled: 1) fernery workers, 2) crop workers, and 3) nursery workers. It is hypothesized that fernery workers who are protected from direct sun, but who experience a hot, high humidity environment will have higher levels of uncompensated heat stress when compared to workers in nursery operations or in open crop fields. Knowledge about agricultural work practices, individual risk factors and physiologic responses to work in hazardous extreme heat environments will help direct heat prevention strategies and decrease heat-related health disparities in this vulnerable population. Results from this study will also expand HRI knowledge and contribute to interventions for other vulnerable working populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Now and in the future, global warming will continue to be a persistent public health threat affecting all living spaces, including those where we live and work. More research is warranted to characterize and quantify the extent of heat as an occupational hazard to inform relevant public health interventions that protect vulnerable populations. Occupational study on extreme heat exposure, adaptation, and health vulnerability in farmworkers working in a high-heat region of the country, we can better assess heat stress response and sensitivity to health impacts among those integral to ensuring the food security of this nation.            ",Characterization of Heat-Related Illness in Central Florida Farmworkers,8967108,F31NR014611,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Body Composition ', ' Charge ', ' Clothing ', ' Dizziness ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heating ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Humidity ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Occupational Groups ', ' Nausea ', ' Nurseries ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' Perception ', ' Plants ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' solar radiation ', ' Solar Energy ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration ', ' Occupational Safety and Health Administration ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Heat Cramp ', ' Latino ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Shelter facility ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Surface ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Death Rate ', ' Hazard Management ', ' Global Warming ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' agriculture worker ', ' Agricultural Workers ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' heat-related illness ', ' Heat Stress Syndromes ', ' Heat Stress ', ' Heat Stress Disorders ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Exposure to ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' occupational hazard ', ' sun ', ' The Sun ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Country ', ' Occupational ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Organ failure ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Skin ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' Address ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' solar exposure ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' Symptoms ', ' Harvest ', ' Intake ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' food security ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' high risk ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' operation ', ' public health intervention ', ' extreme heat ', ' collaborative environment ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,43576,0.0381233513233525

"Understanding and Improving Medicaid Use for Routine and Preventive Care among Women on Probation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has created an unprecedented opportunity for women with criminal justice involvement (CJI) to obtain health insurance coverage, primarily through Medicaid expansion in 32 states and the District of Columbia. The vast majority (77%) of women with CJI are on probation. The proposed study will investigate healthcare utilization among women on probation who have Medicaid, focusing on health literacy and other factors that influence type (e.g., urgent, routine) and venue (e.g., emergency department, community clinic) of care. Women with CJI are disproportionately low-income women of color who are strongly affected by health disparities, with much higher burdens of preventable and chronic health conditions than women without CJI. In addition to practical, social, and economic factors, the Institute of Medicine recognizes that poor health literacy is a major barrier to the use of preventive and routine care among disadvantaged populations. Poor health literacy is associated with lower likelihood of receiving preventive care and poorer outcomes for chronic health conditions. It also contributes to overuse of urgent and emergency care. Guided by the Health Literacy Skills Framework and the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, our research aims are as follows:  Aim 1: To identify health literacy and other enabling, impeding, and need factors that influence type (e.g., urgent, routine) and venue (e.g., emergency department, community clinic) of healthcare utilization in a cohort (n=360) of women on probation who have Medicaid.  Aim 2: To explore how criminal justice involvement, health literacy, and prior experiences navigating healthcare settings contextualize type and venue of healthcare utilization among a qualitative subsample (n=80) of women on probation who have Medicaid.  Aim 3: To use findings from Aims 1 and 2 to adapt an existing health literacy intervention designed for women with CJI, pilot the intervention with women on probation who have Medicaid (n=40), and assess its feasibility and acceptability for a larger efficacy study. The ultimate goal of the intervention would be to shift patterns of Medicaid utilization toward routine and preventive healthcare in community settings.  The proposed study is responsive to PAR-10-133 in its investigation of the influence of health literacy on a behavioral outcome (healthcare utilization) and the development of an intervention to address the specific health literacy needs of a vulnerable population. For women on probation, Medicaid utilization for preventive and routine health care may require specific, focused health literacy education and support. Knowledge from the proposed study will contribute to scholarship on the underlying causes of health disparities among women with CJI, the impact of Medicaid expansion under the ACA, and strategies to improve women’s health by increasing routine and preventive healthcare utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed mixed-methods study will investigate health literacy and other factors that influence type and venue of healthcare utilization among women on probation who have Medicaid. Knowledge gained will contribute to scholarship on the underlying causes of health disparities among women with criminal justice involvement. Findings also will be used to inform the adaptation of an intervention addressing health literacy, thereby advancing the applied research agenda to reduce health disparities.",Understanding and Improving Medicaid Use for Routine and Preventive Care among Women on Probation,9236303,R01MD010439,"['Affect ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"American Samoa Indigenous Samoan Partnership to Initiate REsearch Excellence (INSPIRE) in Colorectal Cancer Health Literacy Project Abstract Very little information regarding the health status of American Samoans are available, and the research infrastructure in America Samoa (AS) requires a sufficient foundation and capacity building to conduct large-scale population health research. The purpose of this project is to: (1) build the research capacity in America Samoa to conduct population health research, and (2) to support a pilot health research project that aims to increase colorectal cancer screening literacy among American Samoans so that initial data will be available and serve as the foundation for future research efforts in America Samoa. This project is a collaborative community and research engaged effort that reflects the community-identified priorities in AS addressing a research gaps in health promotion and cancer prevention. The percentage of American Samoan adults aged 50-75 obtaining CRC screening is far below the US national average, i.e., 7% of American Samoans vs. 58.2% of US adults. Assessment of health literacy levels has been recommended in specific populations and to use assessment results in developing targeted and tailored promotional programs. The proposed Indigenous Samoan Program to Initiate Research Excellence (INSPIRE) – CRC Literacy. (INSPIRE) aims to: (1) strengthen research capacity by providing technical assistance on research protocol, IRB training, and development of an easily accessed cancer data repository, (2) adapt/pilot the Short form Test of Functional Health Literacy – Adults (STOFHLA) and administer revision to a representative sample of older adults recruited through Respondent Driven Sampling methods, and (3) informed by STOFHLA results, develop and implement a culturally competent, linguistically appropriate, and theory-informed screening intervention, use of a 2 group pre-post control group comparison, with measurement of Knowledge-Attitude- Behavior (KAB) survey at several points of evaluation and assessment of the primary outcome namely, timely completion of Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT). INSPIRE efforts will be led by the AS Community Cancer Coalition in partnership with LBJ Tropical Medical Center (LBJTMC), the AS Department of Health and dedicated technical assistance from consultants associated with the University of Hawai`i and Azusa Pacific University in California, with consultant expertise in health literacy, RDS, cancer screening research, STOFHLA, community-based participatory approaches, multi-modal research/evaluation strategies, and history of positive collaboration with AS partners. This effort should result in increased screening use and contribute to building a foundation for future translational research. INSPIRE-produced research is significant for AS because it lays a much needed foundation for systematic public health research. Further, INSPIRE research will contribute to advancement in the science of health literacy and health promotions with/for resource-poor, yet tradition-rich Indigenous communities thereby, offering the hopeful prospect of eliminating socially-constructed and harmful health inequalities. Project Narrative INSPIRE aims are to increase research capacity in American Samoa and to conduct a pilot research project ton colorectal cancer screening literacy. INSPIRE-produced research is significant for AS because it lays a much needed foundation for systematic public health research by building local research capacity and providing initial key health data.

"Translating Obesity and Diabetes Prevention into the Worksite for Immigrant Popul DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and diabetes are serious health problems in the United States, with rapidly increasing prevalence and incidence over the last 10 years. National data document alarming increases in overweight and obesity, and among Latinos the prevalence is 78%, markedly higher than in the general population. An estimated 25.6 million people 20 years or older have diabetes in the U.S., with the greatest increases in prevalence among racial and ethnic minority populations, further complicated by disparities in socioeconomic status. Hispanics face a diabetes prevalence twice that of non-Hispanic whites and suffer higher rates of diabetes complications and mortality. Nationally, it is estimated that there are over 2.6 million hired farm workers in the U.S., and California is among the largest employers of these workers. In California, over 450,000 people are employed in agriculture, with more than two-thirds being of Latino ethnicity. Most are immigrants with low levels of education and many have Spanish as their only language. This population also faces issues with limited access to health care, compounded by poverty and low socioeconomic status. While intervention efforts have demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle approach promoting diet and physical activity can significantly reduce obesity and diabetes incidence, there continues to be a need for effective programs designed for underserved and immigrant populations - a sizeable proportion of the U.S. working population. The overall goal of this study is to validate the effectiveness of an obesity and diabetes intervention among low-literate immigrant farm workers. We propose that a lifestyle intervention delivered at the agricultural worksite will improve obesity and diabetes risk for employees and will prove to be cost effective for the employer. The collaboration of established investigators at UC Davis with Reiter Affiliated Companies (RAC, a large berry grower in California) and the Health Initiative of the Americas at UC Berkeley (experts in organizing health campaigns for underserved immigrant populations) creates a unique opportunity to achieve significant positive health outcomes through a total worker health approach. Our efforts will build upon two successful pilot studies conducted with RAC and will enable us to reach a larger number of people and evaluate the program's translation and sustainability potential. Successful achievement of the project goals will enable dissemination of the program to improve the health of workers via a cost effective and culturally-tailored obesity and diabetes risk factor intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interventions, such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), have demonstrated that moderate lifestyle changes can significantly reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes incidence. Our approach is to deliver a obesity and diabetes lifestyle intervention in a culturally resilient context and integrated into a workplace setting. This intervention is designed to reach farm working and other immigrant Latino workers in low-wage industries, a large and growing population with an elevated risk for obesity and diabetes in the U.S. Additionally, the project includes an economic evaluation to appraise long-term sustainability, an important consideration for employers considering health and wellness programs.",Translating Obesity

"Reducing Cancer Health Disparities in Navajo Nation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are disproportionately affected by many health disparities, including the lowest cancer survival rates of any racial group in the United States. Cancers that could have been prevented or detected through screening are often diagnosed in late stages, contributing to excess mortality. Therefore, in order to address cancer disparities in Indian Country, more focus must be placed raising awareness about cancer prevention and early detection. The COPE (Community Outreach and Patient Empowerment) Project provides training and evidence-based, culturally-informed educational materials to community health workers as a means to raise health literacy and reduce health disparities in Native communities. The COPE Project has partnered with the American Cancer Society (ACS) to provide cancer- specific training for community health workers in Navajo Nation and now seeks to adapt and disseminate the ACS's cancer curriculum using interactive information technology with the goal of improving prevention and early detection activities. Engaging, easy-to-use technology will be designed for hand-held devices to offer users tailored health education. We will evaluate characteristics and patterns of community users, when delivered passively (self-use by community member) or mediated by a community health worker. We will also evaluate the impact of the system on technology literacy and cancer awareness among community health workers and community members. In addition, we will develop a web-based training portal to disseminate the training and curriculum to other Native communities. We will evaluate competency among community health workers trained through in-person and virtual sessions to assess whether virtual training can provide an effective and efficient medium to disseminate curricula broadly across community health workers serving multiple communities. We will conduct this study in close collaboration with the Navajo Nation Division of Health, New Mexico Department of Health, and the Navajo Area Indian Health Service. This 3-year project will employ a community-based participatory feedback approach to develop, implement, and evaluate an online patient-centered cancer curriculum. This approach could have a meaningful public health impact and offer a new approach for the use of technological education tools in rural, underserved populations by leveraging existing curriculum and resources to deliver culturally sensitive and relevant education in a collaborative manner.

"Advancing Research in Health Literacy Project Abstract Paasche-Orlow, M: Advancing Research in Health Literacy The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has defined health literacy as the “degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.” Unfortunately, fully 22% of US adults have only basic and an additional 14% have below basic health literacy. The relationship between limited literacy and adverse health outcomes has been well documented. In addition, health literacy has been shown to be an important mediator of racial and ethnic health disparities. An important next step to cultivate this emerging research field is to create a national professional interdisciplinary home for investigators dedicated to health literacy in a manner that is oriented to eliminating health disparities. In this grant application we propose to deliver a eighth annual conference along a multi-year trajectory dedicated to the promotion of the field of health literacy research as a health disparities discipline. In this year, the meeting will be designed to focus on patients with low English proficiency and on interventions. This venue serves crucial functions for the field of health literacy by providing an incubator for young investigators and encouraging a cross-disciplinary exchange of knowledge, collaboration, and creativity. We aim to create an environment in which controversial topics within the research community can be openly discussed. Dr. Paasche-Orlow has served as a guest editor for special journal issues emerging from each of the past meetings; we plan to continue our successful dissemination efforts with another free full-text special issue on Health Literacy to be published by the Journal of Health Communication. We will provide a live- streaming video service for stakeholders who are unable to attend in person and will archive presentations on the conference Web site. This year the meeting will take place on October 17- 18, 2016 in Bethesda, MD. Project Narrative: Paasche-Orlow, M: Advancing Research in Health Literacy The relationship between limited health literacy and adverse health outcomes has been well documented.

"Training At-Risk Industrial, Telecommunication and Immigrant Workers on How to Protect Themselves from Exposure to Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Products ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Steelworkers Charitable and Educational Organization (SCEO), the non-profit (501c3) arm of the United Steelworkers (USW), is applying for HWWTP, HDPTP and ECWTP funds to support a training partnership linking two of the largest U.S.-based industrial unions with rapidly expanding immigrant worker centers. The Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC), the SCEO's training entity, brings together the USW, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the Labor Institute (LI), and the National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON) and Make the Road New York (MRNY). In the next five years through these three submissions, the TMC will provide more than 65,000 workers and community residents with over 950,000 hours of training to help prevent toxic releases, fires, explosions, injuries, sickness and death. Through our proposed HWWTP five-year program, we will conduct 2,745 courses that will reach 55,950 workers, managers and community residents with 633,700 hours of training. To prevent fatalities, injuries, illnesses and releases of hazardous substances, we will focus WTP training and mentoring on H&S committee members and other activists who are in a position to help achieve concrete and lasting institutional changes at hundreds of U.S. worksites and communities. For our worker center partners, the focus will be on building a robust and widely dispersed H&S training capacity (in English and Spanish) for immigrant day-laborers and temporary workers who face a myriad of hazards on their ever-shifting worksites. The HDPTP program will establish a multi-lingual team of trainers (Specialized Emergency Response Trainers - SERTs) who are prepared to go anywhere at any time to provide training to emergency response and clean-up workers and community members engaged in massive man-made or weather-related disasters. To achieve this goal will dramatically increase the supply of Spanish language OSHA-certified Master Trainers who can conduct the full-range of HWWTP-related OSHA courses. We also will establish a SERTs infectious diseases working group to provide training expertise on donning and doffing high-level protective clothing and the proper use of related equipment to protect health care and hazardous waste workers. Our HDPTP program will offer 400 classes that will provide 9,050 at-risk workers and community residents with 119,000 contact hours. In the ECWTP program we will support and enhance workforce development programs conducted by MRNY in Queens and Brooklyn, NY, and the A. Philip Randolph Institute (APRI) in Pittsburgh, PA to place unemployed and underemployed workers in decent-paying occupations in construction, environmental cleanup and other green jobs. After providing 15 weeks of training for up to 450 workers over the term of the award, we will place at least 75 percent of these participants in good green jobs. Target Populations: The TMC has access to over 1.2 million USW/CWA workers and managers at facilities located in each U.S. state as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. They work in oil, chemical manufacturing, nuclear energy, pharmaceuticals, pulp, paper, automobile parts, appliance manufacturing, cement, metal manufacturing, construction, rubber, plastics, shipbuilding, light manufacturing, telecommunications, transportation, electrical manufacturing and health care. Approximately 850,000 of these workers are potentially exposed to hazardous substances covered by OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910, EPA 40 CFR 311, and DOT 49 CFR 171-177. The day laborers and temporary workers we will reach are employed in virtually every kind of clean-up activity, especially during emergencies, in addition to construction, car washes, cleaning, home care, warehousing and distribution. MRNY has over 16,000 members at its centers in New York in Bushwick, Jackson Heights, Port Richmond, Midland Beach, and Brentwood, Long Island. It is opening new centers in NJ, CT and PA. NDLON is a network of 45 day-laborer organizations in fifteen states and it estimates that approximately 5,000 workers pass through its centers nationwide each day.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 300 worker-trainers from the United Steelworkers (USW), the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), and Make the Road New York (MRNY) will provide hazardous waste training to front-line workers, communities and other-stakeholders in order to protect the worker health and safety, the public's health, and the environment. The workers we represent, who produce, dispose of, and transport billions of pounds of hazardous substances and wastes, will receive HAZWOPER and related OSHA training. Our combined HWWTP, HDPTP and ECWTP proposed five-year programs will conduct over 3,300 classes for 65,000 workers and residents, providing more than 900,000 hours of training.            ","Training At-Risk Industrial, Telecommunication and Immigrant Workers on How to Protect Themselves from Exposure to Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Products",9119002,U45ES006175,"['Academy ', ' Americas ', ' Automobiles ', ' Award ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' C element ', ' Carbon ', ' Chemistry ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Workers ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' pulp ', ' Dental Pulp ', ' Disasters ', ' Dust ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Environment and Public Health ', ' Equipment ', ' Explosion ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Hazardous Chemicals ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Waste ', ' Health ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mentors ', ' Metals ', ' New York ', ' Atomic Energy ', ' Nuclear Energy ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Oils ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Paper ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Poisons ', ' Protective Clothing ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Risk ', ' natural Rubber ', ' Latex Rubber ', ' Rubber ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' statistics ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telecommunications ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Transportation ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States Virgin Islands ', ' Virgin Islands ', ' Waste Products ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Underemployment ', ' underemployed ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Killings ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' patient home care ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' news ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Country ', ' Height ', ' Occupational ', ' meetings ', ' hazard ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' nanotechnological ', ' nanotech ', ' nano-technological ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' Committee Members ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' resilience ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' community organizations ', ' Long Island ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' Toxics Release Inventory ', ' arm ', ' Emergency response ', ' Workforce Development ', ' ']",NIEHS,STEELWORKER CHARITABLE/EDUCATIONAL ORG,U45,2016,2174160,0.06766243852285567

Approximately 850,000 of these workers are potentially exposed to hazardous substances covered by OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910, EPA 40 CFR 311, and DOT 49 CFR 171-177. The day laborers and temporary workers we will reach are employed in virtually every kind of clean-up activity, especially during emergencies, in addition to construction, car washes, cleaning, home care, warehousing and distribution. MRNY has over 16,000 members at its centers in New York in Bushwick, Jackson Heights, Port Richmond, Midland Beach, and Brentwood, Long Island. It is opening new centers in NJ, CT and PA. NDLON is a network of 45 day-laborer organizations in fifteen states and it estimates that approximately 5,000 workers pass through its centers nationwide each day. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 300 worker-trainers from the United Steelworkers (USW), the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), and Make the Road New York (MRNY) will provide hazardous waste training to front-line workers, communities and other-stakeholders in order to protect the worker health and safety, the public's health, and the environment. The workers we represent, who produce, dispose of, and transport billions of pounds of hazardous substances and wastes, will receive HAZWOPER and related OSHA training. Our combined HWWTP, HDPTP and ECWTP proposed five-year programs will conduct over 3,300 classes for 65,000 workers and residents, providing more than 900,000 hours of training.","Training At-Risk Industrial, Telecommunication and Immigrant Workers on How to Protect Themselves from Exposure to Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Products",9360195,U45ES006175,"['Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' resilience ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' community organizations ', ' Long Island ', ' combat ', ' Toxics Release Inventory ', ' arm ', ' Emergency response ', ' Workforce Development ', ' Academy ', ' Americas ', ' Automobiles ', ' Award ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' C element ', ' Carbon ', ' Chemistry ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Workers ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' pulp ', ' Dental Pulp ', ' Disasters ', ' Dust ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Environment and Public Health ', ' Equipment ', ' Explosion ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Hazardous Chemicals ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Waste ', ' Health ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mentors ', ' Metals ', ' New York ', ' Atomic Energy ', ' Nuclear Energy ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Oils ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Paper ', ' Plastics ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Poisons ', ' Protective Clothing ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Risk ', ' natural Rubber ', ' Latex Rubber ', ' Rubber ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' statistics ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telecommunications ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Transportation ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Virgin Islands ', ' United States Virgin Islands ', ' Waste Products ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' underemployed ', ' Underemployment ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Killings ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' patient home care ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' news ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Country ', ' Height ', ' Occupational ', ' meetings ', ' hazard ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' nanotechnological ', ' nanotech ', ' nano-technological ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' Committee Members ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIEHS,STEELWORKER CHARITABLE/EDUCATIONAL ORG,U45,2016,15000,0.06766243852285567
"Health literacy intervention to improve diabetes outcomes among rural primary care patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We will test the effectiveness and fidelity of embedding the American College of Physicians (ACP) diabetes health literacy intervention among patient-centered medical homes throughout rural Arkansas. Proper diabetes self-care requires patients to have considerable knowledge, a range of skills, and to sustain multiple health behaviors. Self-management interventions are needed that have been designed for individuals with lower literacy skills, that can be readily implemented and sustained among rural clinics with limited resources that disproportionately care for patients with limited literacy. Researchers on our team developed an evidence-based, patient-centered, low literacy ACP intervention promoting diabetes self-care that includes: 1) a diabetes guide that uses plain language and descriptive photographs to teach core diabetes concepts and empower patients to initiate behavior change; 2) a brief counseling strategy to assist patients in developing short-term, explicit and attainable goals for behavior change (`action plans'); 3) a training module for providers (physicians, nurses, medical assistants) that prepares them to assume educator/counselor roles with the Diabetes Guide as a teaching tool; 4) electronic tracking and monitoring tools for primary care practices. While the intervention has previously been field tested and found to significantly improve patient knowledge, self-efficacy, and engagement in related health behaviors, it has not yet been comprehensively tested in practices, and its optimal implementation is not known. We now have a unique opportunity to learn from our prior evaluation, modify and disseminate an ACP health literacy intervention among patients with type 2 diabetes cared for at rural clinics in Arkansas that are Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMH). These practices are embedding care coordination services that can be leveraged to improve chronic disease management. All are supervised by a new University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Center for Health Literacy. Our revised intervention will blend outsourced and clinic-based approaches and redeploy health coaches for counseling self-management mostly via phone, but also at the point-of-care. This is a feasible way to reach rural, vulnerable patients. We will conduct a patient-randomized, pragmatic clinical trial among 6 rural PCMHs in Arkansas, targeting individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Our primary aims are to: 1) test the effectiveness of the ACP diabetes health literacy intervention to improve a range of diabetes-related outcomes among rural patients; 2) compared to usual care, evaluate whether the intervention reduces disparities by patient literacy level. Our secondary aims are to: 3) investigate whether a threshold or gradient effect exists between the amount of follow-up counseling (number of action plans) and intervention effectiveness; 4) determine the fidelity of all intervention components, and explore any identified patient, provider (physician, nurse, health coach), and/or health system barriers to implementation; and 5) assess the costs associated with implementing the intervention from a health system perspective.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study aims to determine the best way to deliver diabetes care, education, and coaching to patients in rural areas so that patients at primary care clinics can be healthier and have fewer health problems resulting from diabetes. We will test two different ways to help patients through counseling, coaching, and written materials.        ",Health literacy intervention to improve diabetes outcomes among rural primary care patients,9104810,R01DK107572,"['Arkansas ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Counseling ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' field study ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' American College of Physicians ', ' point of care ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' arm ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2016,673622,0.1627729740250669
"Health Literacy Assessment and Intervention to Reduce Disparities: FLIGHT/VIDAS II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is a critically important skill that helps people to become active participants in their health care. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy showed that more than 75 million Americans had basic health literacy skills, indicating that as many as 1 in 4 Americans can have difficulty understanding information about their healthcare. Persons in racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have even lower levels of health literacy. Twenty-four percent of blacks (9.5 million persons) and 41% of Hispanics (21 million persons) have below basic levels of health literacy. These persons have lower levels of health literacy and compelling evidence, including our own findings (see below), link race and ethnicity to disparities in health via health literacy. Members of minority groups and older adults are more frequently affected by chronic diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, asthma, hepatitis C, HIV infection, mental health disorders and many others. The twin burdens of chronic disease and low levels of health literacy thus fall disproportionately on those most in need - members of minorities and older adults, all of whom likely to experience one or more chronic conditions while often not having the health literacy skills to help them cope. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a logical target for a general health literacy intervention. In an approach that cuts across specific diseases. CDSM targets problems and skills needed to cope with issues such as fatigue, pain, stress, depression, sleep disturbance and treatment adherence. Studies show that in- person CDSM classes improve patients' functioning and reduce healthcare utilization, but their availability is limited due to the lack of qualified personnel and cost. Similarly, while interventions have been developed to improve health literacy, they are difficult to scale to levels needed to meet the challenge of low health literacy (for more than 40 million persons) due to their cost. Effective interventions with the potential for wider dissemination at reasonable costs are urgently needed. In a previous study, we showed that a computer-delivered tailored information intervention targeting health literacy that can deployed either as an information kiosk in a clinical office or n the Internet could be cost- effective in improving patients' health literacy and adherence. It is nt clear, however, whether the same sort of computer-delivered, multimedia and interactive approach will be effective in improving CDSM skills in persons with low baseline levels of health literacy, and if it is, whether its effects will extend beyond health literacy to general health, slf-efficacy, activation, and treatment adherence. In this follow-up study we will evaluate this possibility by creating a personally relevant computer-delivered intervention targeting CDSM and health literacy among African-Americans, Hispanics, and white non-Hispanics:   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving patient health literacy through their chronic disease management skills and knowledge may be an effective strategy reducing health disparities. In this project we will build on our work in health literacy and computer-delivered interventions to create a new intervention to reduce health disparities by improving health literacy and chronic disease management among African-American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic whites.

"Mechanisms of Health Literacy and Information Accessibility in the Deaf Project Summary Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users are nearly seven times more likely to have inadequate health literacy when compared with their hearing peers. This population is the non-English speaking minority group at greatest risk for miscommunication in health care settings. Health literacy mechanisms for Deaf individuals remain poorly understood, thereby limiting interventions to address health literacy disparities and their impact on health care. It is unclear how differences in attitudes, knowledge, and skills related to health information affect health literacy in Deaf populations and how they may contribute to ongoing health inequities. The two primary objectives of this proposal are: 1) to elucidate the role of information marginalization on health literacy in Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users and 2) to better understand the mechanisms of health literacy in this population so as to identify viable targets for future health literacy intervention development. This proposal is responsive to PAR-10-133's request for studies that assess mechanisms underlying health literacy, including roles of cognition, culture, language fluency, and information-seeking and interpretation ability in the deaf population and, how these may differ from the hearing population. To meet the study objectives, we will employ an explanatory sequential mixed methods design using extensive quantitative data collection procedures, namely, cross-sectional surveys and measures that will identify predictors and moderators of health literacy with 450 Deaf and 450 hearing subjects across three geographically diverse sites. These results will inform the subsequent qualitative assessment that will help explain the quantitative results, and elucidate how and why Deaf individuals access and understand health information. We will incorporate cutting edge technology to assess health information-seeking and interpretation patterns in this population, in addition to using a variety of validated and ASL -accessible instruments to assess health literacy and other constructs related to health literacy. The diverse team, consisting of both leading deaf and hearing researchers, provides a unique insight into how health information is distributed and disseminated visually. This approach has the potential to generate rich data on how to formulate health information and health literacy interventions for individuals with hearing loss. Public Health Relevance (Project Narrative) The public health impact of this study is its ability to understand potential differences in attitudes, knowledge, and skills related to health information between deaf and hearing populations and their degree of impact on health literacy. This research will assist us with improving existing health literacy interventions and tailor future approaches suitable to address the ongoing health inequities seen in the deaf population.",Mechanisms of Health Literacy and Information Accessibility in the Deaf,9145653,R01DC014703,"['Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' health attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Deafness ', ' Knowledge acquisition ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' American Sign Language ', ' Sign Language ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Staging ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' health knowledge ', ' Persons With Hearing Impairments ', ' Hard of Hearing Persons ', ' Deaf ', ' Hearing Impaired Persons ', ' meetings ', ' visual learning ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' cognitive ability ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' Information Literacy ', ' Learning Skill ', ' Formulation ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,619599,0.2447143757633736
"""Don't Know"" Responses to Risk Perception Questions: Identifying Mechanisms and Solutions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strategies to change risk perceptions are a models of health decision making. Both are based on an assumption that may not always be true - that individuals know their risk for a given illness. Preliminary work from our and other laboratories has shown that a non-trivial portion of the population is uncertain about their risk for common illnesses. Moreover, we have shown that uncertainty about one's illness risk is particularly likely among U.S. populations who suffer the burden of health disparities. However, the mechanisms underlying risk uncertainty remain unknown, which limits our ability to develop effective intervention strategies to change behavior, especially in those who remain uncertain about their risk despite the wide-spread dissemination of risk-based health messaging. The objective for this R01 program of research is to explicate the mechanisms leading individuals to answer ""do not know"" in response to risk perception questions. In a program of research encompassing both observational and experimental work, we will examine how factors relating to knowledge and health literacy as well as factors related to defensive information avoidance influence do not know responding. This objective will be achieved by addressing two specific aims: 1) To explore two distinct, theoretically-informed explanations for do not know responding, and 2) To test whether experimentally manipulating the mechanisms hypothesized to cause do not know responding, reduces do not know responding. Aim 1 will be achieved with a national survey examining if low health literacy and defensive risk information avoidance are related to do not know responding to colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes risk perception items. Achieving Aim 2 will be accomplished by experimentally testing 1) whether giving do not know responders with low health literacy health messages tailored to a low health literacy audience increases risk knowledge and reduces do not know responding and 2) whether giving do not know responders who tend to avoid health information the opportunity to self-affirm prior to receiving health messages increases attending to, and comprehension of these messages and reduces do not know responding. This research is significant in that it examines a key, but understudied phenomenon related to a central decision making and behavior change construct, uncertainty about perceived risk for illness. Successful completion of the proposed research will generate tested strategies for developing more effective behavior change messages for individuals who are uncertain about their risk for common illnesses. Given the degree to which uncertainty about illness risk is more common in groups experiencing health disparities populations, our work has the potential to address behavior change factors that contribute to these ongoing health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will explore reasons why a significant proportion of people do not know their risk for two highly preventable diseases, type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer, despite the proliferation of risk-based prevention messages about these diseases. Using a two-part strategy, we will collect observational evidence and experimental evidence for the pathways underlying uncertainty about risk. The latter will also serve to test strategies for decreasing uncertainty about illness risk.","""Don't Know"" Responses to Risk Perception Questions: Identifying Mechanisms and Solutions",9126471,R01CA197351,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Laboratories ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Respondent ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' behavior change ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' risk perception ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' diabetes risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment adherence ', ' ']",NCI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2016,487979,0.07692571297827129
"Care2bWell: A Worksite Physical Activity & Wellness Program for Child Care Staff DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are approximately 1.3 million US child care workers, most of who are hourly employees and classified as low-wage earners. In North Carolina, half of these workers are African American or Hispanic. Many have no health insurance, putting them at increased risk for many serious and chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Regular physical activity (PA) is known to decrease risk of many chronic diseases; unfortunately, most Americans, especially low-income individuals and minorities, fail to meet PA recommendations. A multi-level worksite-based PA intervention offered in child care is an innovative strategy to reach these low wage workers and address health disparities among this high-risk population. While the primary target of our intervention is worker PA, we expect that healthier and more physically active workers will be better role models and promoters of healthy lifestyles for children in their care. This two-arm, cluster RCT (n=104 centers, with 4 workers/center) will test the efficacy of a 6-month Care2bWell (CARE) intervention in increasing workers' PA compared to a Financial Empowerment (FE) control arm. The CARE intervention will include a kick-off workshop, where participants get tailored feedback about their health risks and set behavioral goals, followed by three 2-month long wellness campaigns, during which workers monitor PA, receive tailored feedback, and compete in teams for prizes. Center directors will take part in monthly webinars focused on improving the work environment to support PA and wellness. Within a social ecological framework, Perceptual Control, Social Support, and Diffusion of Innovation theories guide intrapersonal, interpersonal, and center- level intervention components. Participants in the FE arm will receive a parallel intervention to enhance financial health at the individual and center levels. The primary outcome will be accelerometer-measured minutes of moderate to vigorous PA. Primary and secondary outcomes (diet, anthropometrics, psychosocial variables, & center wellness environments) will be assessed at baseline, follow-up (6 mo), and maintenance (18 mo). Detailed process evaluation, cost-effectiveness, and meditational analysis will be used to assess mechanisms of behavior change at the individual and center levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: People who work in lower paying jobs without health insurance, such as child care workers, are at increased risk for many chronic diseases (obesity, heart disease, diabetes). Physical activity can help reduce risk for most of these conditions. A multi-level, child care-based, worksite wellness intervention could be an effective strategy for reaching this high risk population of low-wage workers. Improving workers' health and physical activity is a direct benefit to workers, and helps them become healthy role models for children in their care.",Care2bWell: A Worksite Physical Activity &

"Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Mass. CHC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Massachusetts Community Health Center Abstract Health literacy, broadly defined as ""the wide range of skills and competencies"" that people use to manage their health (Zarcadoolas, et al. 2005, 196-197), is an important aspect of chronic disease self- management (Mancuso and Rincon 2006), though it has been inconsistently associated with medication adherence in multiple studies. While researchers continue to investigate the relationships among health literacy, medication adherence and health outcomes, few have successfully integrated individual-level factors such as health literacy with structural and social factors. In the proposed research, we rely on ethnographic and qualitative data, in combination with quantitative methods, to explore how medication adherence, a widespread problem in chronic disease management, is shaped by structural factors such as insurance copays, as well as by cultural health beliefs. Building on our previous research (Shaw, et al. 2012a, Shaw, et al. 2009b), the proposed study examines health literacy, health beliefs and barriers to medication adherence among patients from five ethnic groups (African-American, Hispanic, white, Vietnamese and Russian immigrant). We base this study in Massachusetts, which has recently expanded the number of people insured under publicly-funded programs while implementing cost-control measures that may limit access to prescription medications, especially for the poor. Drawing on self-report surveys, pill counts, chart review, in-depth interviews and other qualitative methods, this study will meet the following specific aims: 1. Using two different quantitative methods, to assess medication adherence among patients from 5  ethnic groups: (African-American, Hispanic, white, and Vietnamese and Russian immigrants) with  chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia); 2. Use qualitative and ethnographic methods to explore the chronic disease health beliefs that may combine with health literacy to shape medication adherence; 3. To identify factors associated with medication adherence among patients with low health literacy, including:  a. beliefs about medicines; b. food insecurity; c. socioeconomic factors (e.g., type of health insurance coverage; formulary changes); and d. social support. 4. To develop recommendations for primary care providers and policymakers to improve medication adherence and mitigate formulary changes among low-income patients with chronic illness. The unique constellation of conditions in Massachusetts-of near-universal insurance coverage coupled with stringent cost control measures as the state struggles to balance its budget-offers an unmatched research opportunity and serves as a critical bellwether for coming changes facing other states with the advent of the Affordable Care Act. The diverse population of patients served by Caring Health Center, the proposed research site, provides a natural laboratory in which to explore the effects of these policy changes as they intersect with culturally variable health beliefs to shape medication adherence among urban, minority and low-income patients. Improved understanding of these complex dynamics will better prepare primary health care providers to improve adherence and help reduce stroke risk among patients with hypertension and other chronic conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Massachusetts Community Health Center Project Narrative Health literacy plays a pivotal role in shaping the course of chronic disease, including health status, disease severity and patient adherence with prescribed medications. Urban, minority and low-income patients are at higher risk of non adhererence to their chronic disease medication regimens. While much research has been done on patient literacy and readability of forms such as informed consent and patient education materials, fewer studies have explored the relationship between health literacy, structural factors, cultural health beliefs, and medication adherence. This study focuses on an inner-city population burdened by significant disparities in diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and obesity. Not only are Springfield residents 12- 65 percent more likely to be affected by these conditions than Massachusetts residents as a whole, but the city's Black and Latino residents are 20-65 percent more likely to be affected than their Black or Latino counterparts statewide (MDPH 2003-2007). It is well-established that regular adherence to prescribed medication can help reduce the incidence and impact of chronic disease, including stroke. Yet minority and low-income patients, in particular, face significant barriers in adhering o their medication regimens, making them less likely to benefit from available care. Study results have potential national significance, especially in the context of coming changes in the nation's health care system. As tens of millions of additional individuals gain insurance coverage, cost control measures such as formulary changes and copayment tiers will become increasingly common. The Affordable Care Act invests billions more in community health centers over the next decade, and it will become increasingly important to identify effective strategies to improve medication adherence which can be integrated into those clinics where so many of those at highest risk for obesity and chronic illness receive care. Increasing our understanding of cultural factors, including cultural health beliefs, and their relationship to medication adherence among patients with low health literacy, holds significant promise for efforts to reduce disproportionate stroke risk and mortality among minority and low- income populations.","Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Mass.

"Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) is a highly productive research network that is essential to advancing the science and practice of pediatric critical care medicine. The overall aim of this renewal application is for Wayne State University (WSU), under the leadership of Kathleen Meert, MD, to continue as a clinical site in the CPCCRN. Dr. Meert, PI for the CPCCRN at WSU for the past 10 years, is a pediatric intensivist with a wealth of clinical and translational research experienc and an established track record of scientific publications for the CPCCRN. Additionally, Dr. Meert has demonstrated research expertise in behavioral medicine and communication science. Strengths of WSU as a clinical site include the Children s Hospital of Michigan (CHM), a free-standing, tertiary care, academic children s hospital offering the full spectrum of pediatric and surgical subspecialty services. The PICU at CHM is a 38-bed multidisciplinary unit that cares for >1500 patients/year with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Over 85% of PICU patients have follow-up within the institution. CHM is an American College of Surgeons verified Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center and an American Burn Association verified Burn Center. Additional strengths of WSU include its vast experience with federally-funded multicenter research networks such as the Neonatal Network, Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Intervention, Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials Network, Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network, and the Children s Oncology Group. The concept proposal included in this application builds on prior CPCCRN research, led by Dr. Meert, demonstrating many challenges to achieving high quality parent-clinician communication in PICUs. High quality communication is especially important for parents with low health literacy, a key contributing factor to child health disparities. Patient- and family-centered communication (PFCC) may improve the quality of communication but depends, in part, on parents  active participation (e.g., question asking) during clinical interactions. The objective of the concept proposal is to develop a novel communication intervention, the Question Prompt Toolkit; and determine the extent to which the intervention can enhance PFCC in PICUs, and thus improve child and family outcomes. The central hypothesis is that use of the Question Prompt Toolkit will increase parents  active participation in clinical interactions, knowledge, self-efficacy and trust, reduce parent's  anxiety, and ultimately contribute to better health-related quality of life for the child and reduced family burden, especially for families with low health literacy. The hypothesis will be tested in multicenter research that pursues 2 specific aims: (1) Develop the Question Prompt Toolkit for use among parents of critically-ill children; and (2) Determine the extent to which the Question Prompt Toolkit can enhance the use of PFCC in PICUs and improve child and family outcomes. The proposal is significant because it will contribute a new communication intervention that can be applied in PICU practice to address parents'  communication needs and improve health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The concept proposal is relevant to public health because achieving high quality healthcare communication can help to improve the problem of low health literacy. Low health literacy among parents is a key contributor to racial and ethnic disparities i child health and healthcare. Thus, the concept proposal is relevant to the NIH s mission because eliminating health disparities is a major goal of Healthy People 2020.",Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research

"""Don't Know"" Responses to Risk Perception Questions: Identifying Mechanisms and Solutions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strategies to change risk perceptions are a models of health decision making. Both are based on an assumption that may not always be true - that individuals know their risk for a given illness. Preliminary work from our and other laboratories has shown that a non-trivial portion of the population is uncertain about their risk for common illnesses. Moreover, we have shown that uncertainty about one's illness risk is particularly likely among U.S. populations who suffer the burden of health disparities. However, the mechanisms underlying risk uncertainty remain unknown, which limits our ability to develop effective intervention strategies to change behavior, especially in those who remain uncertain about their risk despite the wide-spread dissemination of risk-based health messaging. The objective for this R01 program of research is to explicate the mechanisms leading individuals to answer ""do not know"" in response to risk perception questions. In a program of research encompassing both observational and experimental work, we will examine how factors relating to knowledge and health literacy as well as factors related to defensive information avoidance influence do not know responding. This objective will be achieved by addressing two specific aims: 1) To explore two distinct, theoretically-informed explanations for do not know responding, and 2) To test whether experimentally manipulating the mechanisms hypothesized to cause do not know responding, reduces do not know responding. Aim 1 will be achieved with a national survey examining if low health literacy and defensive risk information avoidance are related to do not know responding to colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes risk perception items. Achieving Aim 2 will be accomplished by experimentally testing 1) whether giving do not know responders with low health literacy health messages tailored to a low health literacy audience increases risk knowledge and reduces do not know responding and 2) whether giving do not know responders who tend to avoid health information the opportunity to self-affirm prior to receiving health messages increases attending to, and comprehension of these messages and reduces do not know responding. This research is significant in that it examines a key, but understudied phenomenon related to a central decision making and behavior change construct, uncertainty about perceived risk for illness. Successful completion of the proposed research will generate tested strategies for developing more effective behavior change messages for individuals who are uncertain about their risk for common illnesses. Given the degree to which uncertainty about illness risk is more common in groups experiencing health disparities populations, our work has the potential to address behavior change factors that contribute to these ongoing health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will explore reasons why a significant proportion of people do not know their risk for two highly preventable diseases, type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer, despite the proliferation of risk-based prevention messages about these diseases. Using a two-part strategy, we will collect observational evidence and experimental evidence for the pathways underlying uncertainty about risk. The latter will also serve to test strategies for decreasing uncertainty about illness risk.","""Don't Know"" Responses to Risk Perception Questions: Identifying Mechanisms and Solutions",9315778,R01CA197351,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Laboratories ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Respondent ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' behavior change ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' risk perception ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' virtual ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' tailored messaging ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment adherence ', ' ']",NCI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2017,296260,0.07692571297827129
"American Samoa Indigenous Samoan Partnership to Initiate REsearch Excellence (INSPIRE) in Colorectal Cancer Health Literacy Project Abstract Very little information regarding the health status of American Samoans are available, and the research infrastructure in America Samoa (AS) requires a sufficient foundation and capacity building to conduct large-scale population health research. The purpose of this project is to: (1) build the research capacity in America Samoa to conduct population health research, and (2) to support a pilot health research project that aims to increase colorectal cancer screening literacy among American Samoans so that initial data will be available and serve as the foundation for future research efforts in America Samoa. This project is a collaborative community and research engaged effort that reflects the community-identified priorities in AS addressing a research gaps in health promotion and cancer prevention. The percentage of American Samoan adults aged 50-75 obtaining CRC screening is far below the US national average, i.e., 7% of American Samoans vs. 58.2% of US adults. Assessment of health literacy levels has been recommended in specific populations and to use assessment results in developing targeted and tailored promotional programs. The proposed Indigenous Samoan Program to Initiate Research Excellence (INSPIRE) – CRC Literacy. (INSPIRE) aims to: (1) strengthen research capacity by providing technical assistance on research protocol, IRB training, and development of an easily accessed cancer data repository, (2) adapt/pilot the Short form Test of Functional Health Literacy – Adults (STOFHLA) and administer revision to a representative sample of older adults recruited through Respondent Driven Sampling methods, and (3) informed by STOFHLA results, develop and implement a culturally competent, linguistically appropriate, and theory-informed screening intervention, use of a 2 group pre-post control group comparison, with measurement of Knowledge-Attitude- Behavior (KAB) survey at several points of evaluation and assessment of the primary outcome namely, timely completion of Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT). INSPIRE efforts will be led by the AS Community Cancer Coalition in partnership with LBJ Tropical Medical Center (LBJTMC), the AS Department of Health and dedicated technical assistance from consultants associated with the University of Hawai`i and Azusa Pacific University in California, with consultant expertise in health literacy, RDS, cancer screening research, STOFHLA, community-based participatory approaches, multi-modal research/evaluation strategies, and history of positive collaboration with AS partners. This effort should result in increased screening use and contribute to building a foundation for future translational research. INSPIRE-produced research is significant for AS because it lays a much needed foundation for systematic public health research. Further, INSPIRE research will contribute to advancement in the science of health literacy and health promotions with/for resource-poor, yet tradition-rich Indigenous communities thereby, offering the hopeful prospect of eliminating socially-constructed and harmful health inequalities. Project Narrative INSPIRE aims are to increase research capacity in American Samoa and to conduct a pilot research project ton colorectal cancer screening literacy. INSPIRE-produced research is significant for AS because it lays a much needed foundation for systematic public health research by building local research capacity and providing initial key health data.

"Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Health Beliefs in a Massachusetts Community Health Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Massachusetts Community Health Center Abstract Health literacy, broadly defined as ""the wide range of skills and competencies"" that people use to manage their health (Zarcadoolas, et al. 2005, 196-197), is an important aspect of chronic disease self- management (Mancuso and Rincon 2006), though it has been inconsistently associated with medication adherence in multiple studies. While researchers continue to investigate the relationships among health literacy, medication adherence and health outcomes, few have successfully integrated individual-level factors such as health literacy with structural and social factors. In the proposed research, we rely on ethnographic and qualitative data, in combination with quantitative methods, to explore how medication adherence, a widespread problem in chronic disease management, is shaped by structural factors such as insurance copays, as well as by cultural health beliefs. Building on our previous research (Shaw, et al. 2012a, Shaw, et al. 2009b), the proposed study examines health literacy, health beliefs and barriers to medication adherence among patients from five ethnic groups (African-American, Hispanic, white, Vietnamese and Russian immigrant). We base this study in Massachusetts, which has recently expanded the number of people insured under publicly-funded programs while implementing cost-control measures that may limit access to prescription medications, especially for the poor. Drawing on self-report surveys, pill counts, chart review, in-depth interviews and other qualitative methods, this study will meet the following specific aims: 1. Using two different quantitative methods, to assess medication adherence among patients from 5  ethnic groups: (African-American, Hispanic, white, and Vietnamese and Russian immigrants) with  chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia); 2. Use qualitative and ethnographic methods to explore the chronic disease health beliefs that may combine with health literacy to shape medication adherence; 3. To identify factors associated with medication adherence among patients with low health literacy, including:  a. beliefs about medicines; b. food insecurity; c. socioeconomic factors (e.g., type of health insurance coverage; formulary changes); and d. social support. 4. To develop recommendations for primary care providers and policymakers to improve medication adherence and mitigate formulary changes among low-income patients with chronic illness. The unique constellation of conditions in Massachusetts-of near-universal insurance coverage coupled with stringent cost control measures as the state struggles to balance its budget-offers an unmatched research opportunity and serves as a critical bellwether for coming changes facing other states with the advent of the Affordable Care Act. The diverse population of patients served by Caring Health Center, the proposed research site, provides a natural laboratory in which to explore the effects of these policy changes as they intersect with culturally variable health beliefs to shape medication adherence among urban, minority and low-income patients. Improved understanding of these complex dynamics will better prepare primary health care providers to improve adherence and help reduce stroke risk among patients with hypertension and other chronic conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Cultural Health Beliefs in a Massachusetts Community Health Center Project Narrative Health literacy plays a pivotal role in shaping the course of chronic disease, including health status, disease severity and patient adherence with prescribed medications. Urban, minority and low-income patients are at higher risk of non adhererence to their chronic disease medication regimens. While much research has been done on patient literacy and readability of forms such as informed consent and patient education materials, fewer studies have explored the relationship between health literacy, structural factors, cultural health beliefs, and medication adherence. This study focuses on an inner-city population burdened by significant disparities in diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and obesity. Not only are Springfield residents 12- 65 percent more likely to be affected by these conditions than Massachusetts residents as a whole, but the city's Black and Latino residents are 20-65 percent more likely to be affected than their Black or Latino counterparts statewide (MDPH 2003-2007). It is well-established that regular adherence to prescribed medication can help reduce the incidence and impact of chronic disease, including stroke. Yet minority and low-income patients, in particular, face significant barriers in adhering o their medication regimens, making them less likely to benefit from available care. Study results have potential national significance, especially in the context of coming changes in the nation's health care system. As tens of millions of additional individuals gain insurance coverage, cost control measures such as formulary changes and copayment tiers will become increasingly common. The Affordable Care Act invests billions more in community health centers over the next decade, and it will become increasingly important to identify effective strategies to improve medication adherence which can be integrated into those clinics where so many of those at highest risk for obesity and chronic illness receive care. Increasing our understanding of cultural factors, including cultural health beliefs, and their relationship to medication adherence among patients with low health literacy, holds significant promise for efforts to reduce disproportionate stroke risk and mortality among minority and low- income populations.","Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Health Beliefs in a Massachusetts Community

"Health Literacy Intervention to Improve Diabetes Outcomes among Rural Primary Care Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We will test the effectiveness and fidelity of embedding the American College of Physicians (ACP) diabetes health literacy intervention among patient-centered medical homes throughout rural Arkansas. Proper diabetes self-care requires patients to have considerable knowledge, a range of skills, and to sustain multiple health behaviors. Self-management interventions are needed that have been designed for individuals with lower literacy skills, that can be readily implemented and sustained among rural clinics with limited resources that disproportionately care for patients with limited literacy. Researchers on our team developed an evidence-based, patient-centered, low literacy ACP intervention promoting diabetes self-care that includes: 1) a diabetes guide that uses plain language and descriptive photographs to teach core diabetes concepts and empower patients to initiate behavior change; 2) a brief counseling strategy to assist patients in developing short-term, explicit and attainable goals for behavior change (`action plans'); 3) a training module for providers (physicians, nurses, medical assistants) that prepares them to assume educator/counselor roles with the Diabetes Guide as a teaching tool; 4) electronic tracking and monitoring tools for primary care practices. While the intervention has previously been field tested and found to significantly improve patient knowledge, self-efficacy, and engagement in related health behaviors, it has not yet been comprehensively tested in practices, and its optimal implementation is not known. We now have a unique opportunity to learn from our prior evaluation, modify and disseminate an ACP health literacy intervention among patients with type 2 diabetes cared for at rural clinics in Arkansas that are Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMH). These practices are embedding care coordination services that can be leveraged to improve chronic disease management. All are supervised by a new University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Center for Health Literacy. Our revised intervention will blend outsourced and clinic-based approaches and redeploy health coaches for counseling self-management mostly via phone, but also at the point-of-care. This is a feasible way to reach rural, vulnerable patients. We will conduct a patient-randomized, pragmatic clinical trial among 6 rural PCMHs in Arkansas, targeting individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Our primary aims are to: 1) test the effectiveness of the ACP diabetes health literacy intervention to improve a range of diabetes-related outcomes among rural patients; 2) compared to usual care, evaluate whether the intervention reduces disparities by patient literacy level. Our secondary aims are to: 3) investigate whether a threshold or gradient effect exists between the amount of follow-up counseling (number of action plans) and intervention effectiveness; 4) determine the fidelity of all intervention components, and explore any identified patient, provider (physician, nurse, health coach), and/or health system barriers to implementation; and 5) assess the costs associated with implementing the intervention from a health system perspective. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study aims to determine the best way to deliver diabetes care, education, and coaching to patients in rural areas so that patients at primary care clinics can be healthier and have fewer health problems resulting from diabetes. We will test two different ways to help patients through counseling, coaching, and written materials.",Health Literacy Intervention to Improve Diabetes Outcomes among Rural Primary Care Patients,9234010,R01DK107572,"['Arkansas ', ' Behavior ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Counseling ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', ' Phonation ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Supervision ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Universities ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' American College of Physicians ', ' point of care ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' arm ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' rural patients ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2017,653108,0.1627729740250669
"Care2bWell: A Worksite Physical Activity & Wellness Program for Child Care Staff DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are approximately 1.3 million US child care workers, most of who are hourly employees and classified as low-wage earners. In North Carolina, half of these workers are African American or Hispanic. Many have no health insurance, putting them at increased risk for many serious and chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Regular physical activity (PA) is known to decrease risk of many chronic diseases; unfortunately, most Americans, especially low-income individuals and minorities, fail to meet PA recommendations. A multi-level worksite-based PA intervention offered in child care is an innovative strategy to reach these low wage workers and address health disparities among this high-risk population. While the primary target of our intervention is worker PA, we expect that healthier and more physically active workers will be better role models and promoters of healthy lifestyles for children in their care. This two-arm, cluster RCT (n=104 centers, with 4 workers/center) will test the efficacy of a 6-month Care2bWell (CARE) intervention in increasing workers' PA compared to a Financial Empowerment (FE) control arm. The CARE intervention will include a kick-off workshop, where participants get tailored feedback about their health risks and set behavioral goals, followed by three 2-month long wellness campaigns, during which workers monitor PA, receive tailored feedback, and compete in teams for prizes. Center directors will take part in monthly webinars focused on improving the work environment to support PA and wellness. Within a social ecological framework, Perceptual Control, Social Support, and Diffusion of Innovation theories guide intrapersonal, interpersonal, and center- level intervention components. Participants in the FE arm will receive a parallel intervention to enhance financial health at the individual and center levels. The primary outcome will be accelerometer-measured minutes of moderate to vigorous PA. Primary and secondary outcomes (diet, anthropometrics, psychosocial variables, & center wellness environments) will be assessed at baseline, follow-up (6 mo), and maintenance (18 mo). Detailed process evaluation, cost-effectiveness, and meditational analysis will be used to assess mechanisms of behavior change at the individual and center levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: People who work in lower paying jobs without health insurance, such as child care workers, are at increased risk for many chronic diseases (obesity, heart disease, diabetes). Physical activity can help reduce risk for most of these conditions. A multi-level, child care-based, worksite wellness intervention could be an effective strategy for reaching this high risk population of low-wage workers. Improving workers' health and physical activity is a direct benefit to workers, and helps them become healthy role models for children in their care.",Care2bWell: A Worksite Physical Activity &

"Health Literacy Assessment and Intervention to Reduce Disparities: FLIGHT/VIDAS II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is a critically important skill that helps people to become active participants in their health care. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy showed that more than 75 million Americans had basic health literacy skills, indicating that as many as 1 in 4 Americans can have difficulty understanding information about their healthcare. Persons in racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have even lower levels of health literacy. Twenty-four percent of blacks (9.5 million persons) and 41% of Hispanics (21 million persons) have below basic levels of health literacy. These persons have lower levels of health literacy and compelling evidence, including our own findings (see below), link race and ethnicity to disparities in health via health literacy. Members of minority groups and older adults are more frequently affected by chronic diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, asthma, hepatitis C, HIV infection, mental health disorders and many others. The twin burdens of chronic disease and low levels of health literacy thus fall disproportionately on those most in need - members of minorities and older adults, all of whom likely to experience one or more chronic conditions while often not having the health literacy skills to help them cope. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a logical target for a general health literacy intervention. In an approach that cuts across specific diseases. CDSM targets problems and skills needed to cope with issues such as fatigue, pain, stress, depression, sleep disturbance and treatment adherence. Studies show that in- person CDSM classes improve patients' functioning and reduce healthcare utilization, but their availability is limited due to the lack of qualified personnel and cost. Similarly, while interventions have been developed to improve health literacy, they are difficult to scale to levels needed to meet the challenge of low health literacy (for more than 40 million persons) due to their cost. Effective interventions with the potential for wider dissemination at reasonable costs are urgently needed. In a previous study, we showed that a computer-delivered tailored information intervention targeting health literacy that can deployed either as an information kiosk in a clinical office or n the Internet could be cost- effective in improving patients' health literacy and adherence. It is nt clear, however, whether the same sort of computer-delivered, multimedia and interactive approach will be effective in improving CDSM skills in persons with low baseline levels of health literacy, and if it is, whether its effects will extend beyond health literacy to general health, slf-efficacy, activation, and treatment adherence. In this follow-up study we will evaluate this possibility by creating a personally relevant computer-delivered intervention targeting CDSM and health literacy among African-Americans, Hispanics, and white non-Hispanics: PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving patient health literacy through their chronic disease management skills and knowledge may be an effective strategy reducing health disparities. In this project we will build on our work in health literacy and computer-delivered interventions to create a new intervention to reduce health disparities by improving health literacy and chronic disease management among African-American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic whites.

Members of minority groups and older adults are more frequently affected by chronic diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, asthma, hepatitis C, HIV infection, mental health disorders and many others. The twin burdens of chronic disease and low levels of health literacy thus fall disproportionately on those most in need - members of minorities and older adults, all of whom likely to experience one or more chronic conditions while often not having the health literacy skills to help them cope. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a logical target for a general health literacy intervention. In an approach that cuts across specific diseases. CDSM targets problems and skills needed to cope with issues such as fatigue, pain, stress, depression, sleep disturbance and treatment adherence. Studies show that in- person CDSM classes improve patients' functioning and reduce healthcare utilization, but their availability is limited due to the lack of qualified personnel and cost. Similarly, while interventions have been developed to improve health literacy, they are difficult to scale to levels needed to meet the challenge of low health literacy (for more than 40 million persons) due to their cost. Effective interventions with the potential for wider dissemination at reasonable costs are urgently needed. In a previous study, we showed that a computer-delivered tailored information intervention targeting health literacy that can deployed either as an information kiosk in a clinical office or n the Internet could be cost- effective in improving patients' health literacy and adherence. It is nt clear, however, whether the same sort of computer-delivered, multimedia and interactive approach will be effective in improving CDSM skills in persons with low baseline levels of health literacy, and if it is, whether its effects will extend beyond health literacy to general health, slf-efficacy, activation, and treatment adherence. In this follow-up study we will evaluate this possibility by creating a personally relevant computer-delivered intervention targeting CDSM and health literacy among African-Americans, Hispanics, and white non-Hispanics: PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving patient health literacy through their chronic disease management skills and knowledge may be an effective strategy reducing health disparities. In this project we will build on our work in health literacy and computer-delivered interventions to create a new intervention to reduce health disparities by improving health literacy and chronic disease management among African-American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic whites.",Health Literacy Assessment and Intervention to Reduce Disparities: FLIGHT/VIDAS II,9488105,R01MD010368,"['adulthood ', '

"Student Wellness Champions for Change: engaging student leaders in enhancing wellness policy implementation through participation and advocacy Project Summary Despite decades of concentrated efforts across myriad sectors, childhood obesity remains a prevailing public health problem, and certain subpopulations, including racial and ethnic minorities and those living in low-income households, are disproportionately affected. Obese children are at higher risk for low quality of life and chronic disease diagnosis, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, in adulthood. Obesity is a complex disease with many influencing factors across the socio-ecological model, including individual, intrapersonal, environmental, policy, and systems-level factors. These factors vary across different social and cultural contexts, further complicating solutions to this widespread public health problem. Eliminating or reducing the childhood obesity burden will likely require a better understanding of not only which intervention strategies are effective to combat these influencing factors, but also whether these strategies can be similarly effective when translated across diverse cultures and contexts. To reach this understanding, researchers, interventionists, and practitioners will need to possess a unique analytic skillset, engage collaborators across multiple sectors, and demonstrate cultural sensitivity. The proposed training plan is designed to address these needs. First, the training plan incorporates cultural competency and health equity training. Second, it involves assembly of a mentoring and advisory team of scientists across disciplines (psychology, nutrition, communications, epidemiology, education). Third, it incorporates didactic training in multi-level modeling and mixed methods data analysis. Finally, the proposed research study allows for application of skills acquired through the training plan. The proposed research study examines the individual and environmental impact of Student Wellness Champions for Change, a health literacy, public health literacy, and youth advocacy-based intervention designed to engage student-led wellness teams in improving school wellness policy implementation and creating health-promoting environments in elementary and middle schools across Maryland. The project uses a rigorous mixed methods evaluation and the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework to assess (1) the extent to which involvement on student wellness teams improve students’ individual health behaviors, weight status, health and public health literacy, and youth advocacy skills; (2) the extent to which student wellness teams make environmental changes in their school. Additionally, the study aims to describe factors, including reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance, that are necessary to inform translation of this intervention strategy to diverse schools across Maryland and beyond. Project Narrative Childhood obesity is a pervasive problem in the United States, particularly among at-risk groups such as racial/ethnic minorities and low-income children. Formation of student-led wellness teams to encourage implementation of Local Wellness Policies (LWPs) and create a health-promoting school environment is a promising strategy to reduce obesity on a large scale, particularly in at-risk groups. This study investigates the effectiveness of student-led wellness teams on both school environment and individual-level outcomes, as well the extent to which these outcomes may be translatable across diverse populations and settings.",Student Wellness Champions for Change: engaging student leaders in enhancing wellness policy implementation through participation and

"Care2bWell: A Worksite Physical Activity & Wellness Program for Child Care Staff DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are approximately 1.3 million US child care workers, most of who are hourly employees and classified as low-wage earners. In North Carolina, half of these workers are African American or Hispanic. Many have no health insurance, putting them at increased risk for many serious and chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Regular physical activity (PA) is known to decrease risk of many chronic diseases; unfortunately, most Americans, especially low-income individuals and minorities, fail to meet PA recommendations. A multi-level worksite-based PA intervention offered in child care is an innovative strategy to reach these low wage workers and address health disparities among this high-risk population. While the primary target of our intervention is worker PA, we expect that healthier and more physically active workers will be better role models and promoters of healthy lifestyles for children in their care. This two-arm, cluster RCT (n=104 centers, with 4 workers/center) will test the efficacy of a 6-month Care2bWell (CARE) intervention in increasing workers' PA compared to a Financial Empowerment (FE) control arm. The CARE intervention will include a kick-off workshop, where participants get tailored feedback about their health risks and set behavioral goals, followed by three 2-month long wellness campaigns, during which workers monitor PA, receive tailored feedback, and compete in teams for prizes. Center directors will take part in monthly webinars focused on improving the work environment to support PA and wellness. Within a social ecological framework, Perceptual Control, Social Support, and Diffusion of Innovation theories guide intrapersonal, interpersonal, and center- level intervention components. Participants in the FE arm will receive a parallel intervention to enhance financial health at the individual and center levels. The primary outcome will be accelerometer-measured minutes of moderate to vigorous PA. Primary and secondary outcomes (diet, anthropometrics, psychosocial variables, & center wellness environments) will be assessed at baseline, follow-up (6 mo), and maintenance (18 mo). Detailed process evaluation, cost-effectiveness, and meditational analysis will be used to assess mechanisms of behavior change at the individual and center levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: People who work in lower paying jobs without health insurance, such as child care workers, are at increased risk for many chronic diseases (obesity, heart disease, diabetes). Physical activity can help reduce risk for most of these conditions. A multi-level, child care-based, worksite wellness intervention could be an effective strategy for reaching this high risk population of low-wage workers. Improving workers' health and physical activity is a direct benefit to workers, and helps them become healthy role models for children in their care.",Care2bWell: A Worksite Physical Activity &

"Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) is a highly productive research network that is essential to advancing the science and practice of pediatric critical care medicine. The overall aim of this renewal application is for Wayne State University (WSU), under the leadership of Kathleen Meert, MD, to continue as a clinical site in the CPCCRN. Dr. Meert, PI for the CPCCRN at WSU for the past 10 years, is a pediatric intensivist with a wealth of clinical and translational research experienc and an established track record of scientific publications for the CPCCRN. Additionally, Dr. Meert has demonstrated research expertise in behavioral medicine and communication science. Strengths of WSU as a clinical site include the Children s Hospital of Michigan (CHM), a free-standing, tertiary care, academic children s hospital offering the full spectrum of pediatric and surgical subspecialty services. The PICU at CHM is a 38-bed multidisciplinary unit that cares for >1500 patients/year with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Over 85% of PICU patients have follow-up within the institution. CHM is an American College of Surgeons verified Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center and an American Burn Association verified Burn Center. Additional strengths of WSU include its vast experience with federally-funded multicenter research networks such as the Neonatal Network, Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Intervention, Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials Network, Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network, and the Children s Oncology Group. The concept proposal included in this application builds on prior CPCCRN research, led by Dr. Meert, demonstrating many challenges to achieving high quality parent-clinician communication in PICUs. High quality communication is especially important for parents with low health literacy, a key contributing factor to child health disparities. Patient- and family-centered communication (PFCC) may improve the quality of communication but depends, in part, on parents  active participation (e.g., question asking) during clinical interactions. The objective of the concept proposal is to develop a novel communication intervention, the Question Prompt Toolkit; and determine the extent to which the intervention can enhance PFCC in PICUs, and thus improve child and family outcomes. The central hypothesis is that use of the Question Prompt Toolkit will increase parents  active participation in clinical interactions, knowledge, self-efficacy and trust, reduce parent's  anxiety, and ultimately contribute to better health-related quality of life for the child and reduced family burden, especially for families with low health literacy. The hypothesis will be tested in multicenter research that pursues 2 specific aims: (1) Develop the Question Prompt Toolkit for use among parents of critically-ill children; and (2) Determine the extent to which the Question Prompt Toolkit can enhance the use of PFCC in PICUs and improve child and family outcomes. The proposal is significant because it will contribute a new communication intervention that can be applied in PICU practice to address parents'  communication needs and improve health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The concept proposal is relevant to public health because achieving high quality healthcare communication can help to improve the problem of low health literacy. Low health literacy among parents is a key contributor to racial and ethnic disparities i child health and healthcare. Thus, the concept proposal is relevant to the NIH s mission because eliminating health disparities is a major goal of Healthy People 2020.",Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research

"Reducing Cancer Health Disparities in Navajo Nation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are disproportionately affected by many health disparities, including the lowest cancer survival rates of any racial group in the United States. Cancers that could have been prevented or detected through screening are often diagnosed in late stages, contributing to excess mortality. Therefore, in order to address cancer disparities in Indian Country, more focus must be placed raising awareness about cancer prevention and early detection. The COPE (Community Outreach and Patient Empowerment) Project provides training and evidence-based, culturally-informed educational materials to community health workers as a means to raise health literacy and reduce health disparities in Native communities. The COPE Project has partnered with the American Cancer Society (ACS) to provide cancer- specific training for community health workers in Navajo Nation and now seeks to adapt and disseminate the ACS's cancer curriculum using interactive information technology with the goal of improving prevention and early detection activities. Engaging, easy-to-use technology will be designed for hand-held devices to offer users tailored health education. We will evaluate characteristics and patterns of community users, when delivered passively (self-use by community member) or mediated by a community health worker. We will also evaluate the impact of the system on technology literacy and cancer awareness among community health workers and community members. In addition, we will develop a web-based training portal to disseminate the training and curriculum to other Native communities. We will evaluate competency among community health workers trained through in-person and virtual sessions to assess whether virtual training can provide an effective and efficient medium to disseminate curricula broadly across community health workers serving multiple communities. We will conduct this study in close collaboration with the Navajo Nation Division of Health, New Mexico Department of Health, and the Navajo Area Indian Health Service. This 3-year project will employ a community-based participatory feedback approach to develop, implement, and evaluate an online patient-centered cancer curriculum. This approach could have a meaningful public health impact and offer a new approach for the use of technological education tools in rural, underserved populations by leveraging existing curriculum and resources to deliver culturally sensitive and relevant education in a collaborative manner.

"PBS NewsHour Health Literacy and Student Reporting Labs: Broad expansion of journalism to increase bioscience literacy in America and support the next generation of biomedical science communicators. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using a combination of high quality broadcast and Web-streamed news reports on emerging public health concerns, youth-generated videos addressing health-related topics, and online curriculum resources, PBS NewsHour will engineer successful public health education experiences that engage the American public, students of all backgrounds - particularly those in underserved populations - to explore biomedical research and emerging health science information as it emerges in academic institutions, private laboratories and public health institutions throughout the country. To identify cutting edge storie of concern to the American public, PBS NewsHour will commission an annual survey of priority public health concerns and then, using that crowdsourced material, work with a blue-ribbon medical advisory council to help identify key experts and material to support in-depth journalism into those topics. The NewsHour aims to engage with the public on issues that are on their minds but then take the reporting to the next level, so that people understand not only what is at stake for them personally, but how what is happening in labs and universities translates into new advances and developments. Social media will be used both to engage with the public and to promote this content. Through this funding and using these stories produced by the award winning PBS NewsHour medical reporting team as a focus, the PBS NewsHour's Student Reporting Labs will experiment with an adaptation of its successful science program to work with eight Labs to produce unique news stories that view health science topics from a youth perspective. These videos will become part of a comprehensive set of lesson plans and learning tools disseminated online to the general public, educators and youth media organizations to draw attention to American health and biomedical issues and careers. Students will be supported with curricula and mentorship on fundamental research practice and the critical thinking skills necessary for responsible journalism. This process will ensure the next generation includes citizens who are effective health science communicators and self-motivated learners with a deep connection to the role of biomedical research in their careers and future life. Youth program resources will be posted on the PBS NewsHour Extra site to serve its 700,000 annual users and our partner sites PBS Learning Media and Share My Lesson - the two biggest free education resource sites on the web. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To increase public health literacy, all sectors of society must have access to the highest-quality health science news and information possible, suited to their learning needs, cognitive capacities, and health concerns. Translation, packaging and broad dissemination is important to this goal: the stories matter. PBS NewsHour, the most trusted news in America, is ideally positioned to raise the level of discourse and decision making around public health issues through production of targeted health news stories and emerging issues in the biomedical field. Through SEPA funding, adaptation of PBS NewsHour's Student Reporting Labs and youth mentoring program has the potential to address health disparities and science literacy deficits and to build a new cadre of minority youth and youth from low socio-economic status communities who will have the discipline, creativity and critical thinking skills needed to be successful health science-literate citizens and advocates in their communities and for their peers.",PBS NewsHour Health Literacy and Student Reporting Labs: Broad expansion of journalism to increase bioscience literacy in America and support the next generation of biomedical science communicators.,9542597,R25OD020212,"['Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' creativity ', ' Creativeness ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Decision Making ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Engineering ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Sciences ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Privatization ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Opinion ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' news ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stream ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Journalism ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' literate ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Public Health Education ', ' Public Health Training ', ' Public Health Instruction ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' Advanced Development ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' fundamental research ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health priorities ', ' Critical Thinking ', ' Evaluative Thinking ', ' Complex thinking ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' online course ', ' online curriculum ', ' E-course ', ' learning outcome ', ' social media ', ' teacher community ', ' team teaching ', ' teacher collaboration ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",OD,WETA TV 26,R25,2017,527385,0.07226840212646989
"Breast Cancer Screening: Priorities and Attitudes of Diverse Women Under 50 PROJECT SUMMARY Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death and the leading cause of premature mortality for women in the U.S. Women who are racial/ethnic minorities experience an unequal burden of the disease. Breast cancer screening mammography guidelines for women aged 40-49 years are controversial. The potential benefit of avoiding an advanced cancer is often emphasized, while minimizing the frequency of possible harms. Conflicting recommendations for age at initiation and frequency of screening mammography for women aged 40-49 years highlight concerns related to the benefits and harms of screening. These conflicting recommendations leave women confused about when to initiate screening, how often to be screened, what sources to trust, and can undermine informed decision-making about screening mammography. Women from diverse racial/ethnic groups and those with limited health literacy are particularly vulnerable to misunderstanding screening recommendations. Health literacy is the degree to which one has the ability to obtain, process, understand, and use health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions. Those with limited health literacy have difficulty navigating the health care system, making health care decisions, and utilizing cancer screening, all contributing to disparities in cancer care. Health literacy is often a more powerful predictor of health disparities than more well-established predictors such as education and race/ethnicity. Moreover, individuals from traditionally medically underserved communities (e.g., racial/ethnic minority, low socioeconomic status [SES]) are at higher risk for lower health literacy, which can also reduce participation in cancer screening. This project will compare the intersections and differences between how Latina, Black, and non-Latina White women consider the benefits and harms associated with breast cancer screening mammography. The goal of this project is to create decision support tools for Latina, Black, and non-Latina White women with varying levels of health literacy under age 50 considering breast cancer screening mammography.

"The impact of health literacy, culture and psychosocial factors on the Pap testing behaviors of African immigrant women in the United States PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In sub-Saharan Africa, cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death, with 68,000 new cases detected each year, and a high percentage remaining undiagnosed. In the United States (U.S), an introduction of the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, a low-cost early detection procedure, has resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of cervical cancer. However, African immigrant women (AIW), a fast-growing immigrant population in the US, face a disproportionate burden of disease, and their worse cancer outcomes have been attributed to low Pap testing. Studies of other immigrant groups such as Asians and Hispanics, have shown that limited health literacy, the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions, is associated with poor cancer screening. However, there is a dearth of research on how this phenomenon presents among AIW, and the pathways by which health literacy impacts Pap testing are unclear. Within the African cultural context, informal communication methods are used to disseminate women’s health information, and may play a crucial role in influencing health literacy. Therefore, sources (family/relatives, friends, ethnic church, TV/Radio, internet, social media, physician) and types (verbal, written text, pictures) of health information exchange are suggested as possible mechanism by which health literacy is influenced and health behavior such as Pap testing are adopted. The purpose of this mixed methods study is to understand how sources and types of health information impact health literacy and ultimately, Pap testing behaviors among AIW in the US. The study will address these specific aims: (1) Examine the relationships of the number of sources and types of health information with the level of health literacy among AIW; (2) Examine the mechanism through which sources and types of health information and health literacy impact Pap testing behaviors among AIW; (3) Explore how sources of health information influence AIW Pap testing behaviors and how they seek health information using open-ended interviews; (4) Describe how sources/types of health information impact health literacy and information sharing to guide Pap testing. The project is guided by an adapted Health Literacy Skills framework, a conceptual model which addresses the determinants of health literacy, and the relationship between health literacy and Pap testing. A comprehensive and disease specific instrument validated in immigrant populations will be the primary measure of health literacy. This study is aligned with the NCI strategic mission to improve health outcomes among minority populations. This training plan will begin a program of research to understand the complex interaction among health literacy, culture, and psychosocial determinants of Pap testing. This study will inform the development of culturally tailored interventions to promote Pap testing to help decrease the burden of cervical cancer and cancer disparities among underserved African immigrant women. PROJECT NARRATIVE Limited health literacy is a major barrier to cancer prevention behaviors—particularly among underserved racial/ethnic minority populations such as African immigrant women. Among African immigrant women, cancer is diagnosed at a significantly later stage, and they are also among the least likely ethnic/racial groups to receive cervical cancer screening compared to African Americans, Asian and Hispanic immigrants. This proposed study seeks to understand how sources and types of health information exchange impacts health literacy, and how health literacy influences Pap testing behaviors among AIW living in the US.","The impact of health literacy, culture and psychosocial factors on the Pap testing behaviors of African immigrant women in the United States",9398221,F31CA221096,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Services ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Preventive Health Services ', ' Preventative health service ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cervical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Church ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Communication Methods ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Radio ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' social media ', ' Information Literacy ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,0.1658181447793723
"""The Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Communities Worker Health and Safety Training Program"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Dillard University Deep South Center for Environmental Justice hazardous Waste Worker Training Center provides training to hazardous material and waster workers who may perform jobs covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standards and assist employers with complying with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120. The Consortium's goal is unique in that its emphasis is on underserved populations in both its Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program (HWWTP) and its Environmental Careers Worker Training Program (ECWTP).  The proposed HWWTP component has been designed to provide model occupational safety and health training for workers who are or may be engaged in activities related to hazardous waste removal, containment or chemical response. The emphasis however, is on servicing workers of entities where health and safety training is critical to the worker's wellbeing and possibly the safety and health of the public, but due to circumstances beyond the individual worker's control, (s)he is unlikely to receive sufficient training at either the quality or quantity needed to ensure safety and health. Such entities include emergency responders and city workers in small municipalities and or cities where budgeting restraints or working conditions (such as no release time), greatly reduces or eliminates the possibility of training. Volunteer fire departments and small county police forces, city health department employees, port authority workers and mosquito control division employees are examples of workers the Consortium has trained. Additionally, HBCUs with smaller budgets have been shown to receive some of the highest fines for non-compliance with applicable regulations. Small minority and disadvantaged businesses typically lack the capital to participate in high cost compliance training programs. The Consortium has targeted these entities for the proposed HWWT program.  The proposed ECWTP component has been designed to deliver comprehensive worker training to increase the number of underrepresented and disadvantaged minority adults employed in the fields of environmental restoration, hazardous materials and construction. The goals for this program are: (1) to serve underrepresented and disadvantaged adults living near hazardous waste and or contaminated property at risk of exposure to ambient hazards; and also (2) to provide additional pre-employment services that are inclusive of basic skills (i.e. study skills, math, reading, life skils) to increase program retention and completion; and (3) to successfully place trainers in jobs in the environmental restoration and construction fields. The added value of this training is not just that it increases sustainable employment opportunities for residents of beleaguered communities engulfed in situations of poverty and pollution, but that by investing in these particular individuals promotes economic stability, addresses health disparities and advances environmental justice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The HBCU and Communities Consortium Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program is uniquely designed to reach populations for training that have historically, due to poverty and or racism, been disenfranchised and excluded from opportunities existing within society. It also addresses basic inequities in resources for different communities across the country (rural vs urban) and differences in priorities for municipalities and city agencies, with training being first to be cut. Additionally, the Consortium is unique in its make-u in that it includes Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) that by design, serve the selected target population.            ","""The Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Communities Worker Health and Safety Training Program""",9320534,U45ES010664,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Asbestos ', ' Budgets ', ' Capital ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Community Workers ', ' Containment ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disasters ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Goals ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Waste ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Industry ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mining ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mosquito Control ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Sector ', ' Reading ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Societies ', ' sound ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Occupational Safety ', ' Businesses ', ' Police Forces ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Hazardous Waste Sites ', ' base ', ' career ', ' health administration ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' racism ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' heat-related illness ', ' Heat Stress Syndromes ', ' Heat Stress ', ' Heat Stress Disorders ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' restraint ', ' Molds ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Hour ', ' restoration ', ' Country ', ' non-compliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' non-compliant ', ' Services ', ' hazard ', ' authority ', ' Employee ', ' Municipalities ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' skills ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' safety education ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' first responder ', ' emergency service responder ', ' emergency service personnel ', ' Emergency responder ', ' emergency service/first responder ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' remediation ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' chemical release ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' volunteer ', ' gulf coast ', ' health training ', ' public health relevance ', ' environmental justice ', ' operation ', ' Emergency response ', ' climate impact ', ' Study Skills ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority student ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NIEHS,DILLARD UNIVERSITY,U45,2017,315272,0.049632996012657846
"Training At-Risk Industrial, Telecommunication and Immigrant Workers on How to Protect Themselves from Exposure to Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Products ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Steelworkers Charitable and Educational Organization (SCEO), the non-profit (501c3) arm of the United Steelworkers (USW), is applying for HWWTP, HDPTP and ECWTP funds to support a training partnership linking two of the largest U.S.-based industrial unions with rapidly expanding immigrant worker centers. The Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC), the SCEO's training entity, brings together the USW, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the Labor Institute (LI), and the National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON) and Make the Road New York (MRNY). In the next five years through these three submissions, the TMC will provide more than 65,000 workers and community residents with over 950,000 hours of training to help prevent toxic releases, fires, explosions, injuries, sickness and death. Through our proposed HWWTP five-year program, we will conduct 2,745 courses that will reach 55,950 workers, managers and community residents with 633,700 hours of training. To prevent fatalities, injuries, illnesses and releases of hazardous substances, we will focus WTP training and mentoring on H&S committee members and other activists who are in a position to help achieve concrete and lasting institutional changes at hundreds of U.S. worksites and communities. For our worker center partners, the focus will be on building a robust and widely dispersed H&S training capacity (in English and Spanish) for immigrant day-laborers and temporary workers who face a myriad of hazards on their ever-shifting worksites. The HDPTP program will establish a multi-lingual team of trainers (Specialized Emergency Response Trainers - SERTs) who are prepared to go anywhere at any time to provide training to emergency response and clean-up workers and community members engaged in massive man-made or weather-related disasters. To achieve this goal will dramatically increase the supply of Spanish language OSHA-certified Master Trainers who can conduct the full-range of HWWTP-related OSHA courses. We also will establish a SERTs infectious diseases working group to provide training expertise on donning and doffing high-level protective clothing and the proper use of related equipment to protect health care and hazardous waste workers. Our HDPTP program will offer 400 classes that will provide 9,050 at-risk workers and community residents with 119,000 contact hours. In the ECWTP program we will support and enhance workforce development programs conducted by MRNY in Queens and Brooklyn, NY, and the A. Philip Randolph Institute (APRI) in Pittsburgh, PA to place unemployed and underemployed workers in decent-paying occupations in construction, environmental cleanup and other green jobs. After providing 15 weeks of training for up to 450 workers over the term of the award, we will place at least 75 percent of these participants in good green jobs. Target Populations: The TMC has access to over 1.2 million USW/CWA workers and managers at facilities located in each U.S. state as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. They work in oil, chemical manufacturing, nuclear energy, pharmaceuticals, pulp, paper, automobile parts, appliance manufacturing, cement, metal manufacturing, construction, rubber, plastics, shipbuilding, light manufacturing, telecommunications, transportation, electrical manufacturing and health care. Approximately 850,000 of these workers are potentially exposed to hazardous substances covered by OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910, EPA 40 CFR 311, and DOT 49 CFR 171-177. The day laborers and temporary workers we will reach are employed in virtually every kind of clean-up activity, especially during emergencies, in addition to construction, car washes, cleaning, home care, warehousing and distribution. MRNY has over 16,000 members at its centers in New York in Bushwick, Jackson Heights, Port Richmond, Midland Beach, and Brentwood, Long Island. It is opening new centers in NJ, CT and PA. NDLON is a network of 45 day-laborer organizations in fifteen states and it estimates that approximately 5,000 workers pass through its centers nationwide each day.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 300 worker-trainers from the United Steelworkers (USW), the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), and Make the Road New York (MRNY) will provide hazardous waste training to front-line workers, communities and other-stakeholders in order to protect the worker health and safety, the public's health, and the environment.

"Enhancing clinical trials participation though library partnerships Underrepresentation of health disparity populations in clinical trials has the potential to exacerbate and perpetuate health disparities. There are several notable barriers to clinical trials participation, however low research literacy may be a key barrier yet rarely addressed. Few tools exist for enhancing clinical trials research literacy and promoting clinical trials resources for consumers, and fewer yet have been specifically developed for minority and underrepresented populations. Developed in conjunction with 28 partner institutions associated with the NCI funded Cancer Disparities Research Network, we have developed a clinical trials research literacy tool intended to clearly and simply explain elements of research and trials that are understandable, usable and useful to will empower diverse consumers to make fully informed decisions when considering enrollment in clinical trials. We seek to leverage information technology and library partnerships to transform the research literacy materials into a web-based tool and evaluate implementation of the tool in libraries and hospital patient education centers. Due to their accessibility and roles as information gatekeepers, librarians and health providers that serve medically underserved underrepresented populations are promising partners for disseminating clinical trials information. Thus, we propose to employ a user-centered design process to transform our current card-based tool to a functional, and more easily accessible web-based tool for consumers and a supplemental training module for librarians and health providers. Iterative prototype development will involve focus groups, an environmental scan of available clinical trials resources to identify opportunities to enhance the tool with direct linkages to local clinical trials, and key informant interviews among librarians and healthcare providers to inform the development of a supplemental training module applicable across libraries and patient education centers. Following development of the tool, leveraging the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR), we will deploy the tool among 10 libraries and patient education centers to evaluate factors influencing implementation and clinical trials participation outcomes. Pre- post surveys among n=125 library and patient education center patrons using the tool will assess outcomes related to research literacy and intentions to engage in clinical trials. A survey among n=50 librarians, community organization leaders, community health workers and healthcare providers will identify factors influencing the implementation of the research literacy tool in libraries, community organizations and hospital patient education centers. Results will be used to develop a generalizable model for health system - public library partnerships to sustain and disseminate the tool to other settings. The participation of diverse populations in clinical trials is crucial to advancing science, discoveries, health care delivery and overall human health. There are many studies focused on barriers to diverse clinical trials enrollment, however there is little focus on the conversations that need to occur prior to approaching a potential participant in clinical trials- including a focus on: building trust, dispelling research participation myths, improving research literacy. This proposal aims to build on our low-tech version of our research literacy communication tool tested in diverse populations and transform it to a web-based version to disseminate to diverse populations to use in conjunction with their local librarians, community organizations/community health workers, and health care providers.",Enhancing clinical trials participation though library partnerships,9403450,G08LM012688,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Americas ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Computers ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Demography ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Evolution ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Health Science Library ', ' literacy ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Standardization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Librarians ', ' Measures ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Ensure ', ' Trust ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' Participant ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Modeling ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' Communication Tools ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Output ', ' implementation trial ', ' implementation research ', ' Information Technology ', ' Minority ', ' gun violence ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' web-accessible ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' user centered design ', ' stem ', ' implementation science ', ' tool development ', ' prototype ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' arm ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' web-based tool ', ' ']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,G08,2017,98763,0.009785017466029413
"PBS NewsHour Health Literacy and Student Reporting Labs: Broad expansion of journalism to increase bioscience literacy in America and support the next generation of biomedical science communicators ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using a combination of high quality broadcast and Web-streamed news reports on emerging public health concerns, youth-generated videos addressing health-related topics, and online curriculum resources, PBS NewsHour will engineer successful public health education experiences that engage the American public, students of all backgrounds - particularly those in underserved populations - to explore biomedical research and emerging health science information as it emerges in academic institutions, private laboratories and public health institutions throughout the country. To identify cutting edge storie of concern to the American public, PBS NewsHour will commission an annual survey of priority public health concerns and then, using that crowdsourced material, work with a blue-ribbon medical advisory council to help identify key experts and material to support in-depth journalism into those topics. The NewsHour aims to engage with the public on issues that are on their minds but then take the reporting to the next level, so that people understand not only what is at stake for them personally, but how what is happening in labs and universities translates into new advances and developments. Social media will be used both to engage with the public and to promote this content. Through this funding and using these stories produced by the award winning PBS NewsHour medical reporting team as a focus, the PBS NewsHour's Student Reporting Labs will experiment with an adaptation of its successful science program to work with eight Labs to produce unique news stories that view health science topics from a youth perspective. These videos will become part of a comprehensive set of lesson plans and learning tools disseminated online to the general public, educators and youth media organizations to draw attention to American health and biomedical issues and careers. Students will be supported with curricula and mentorship on fundamental research practice and the critical thinking skills necessary for responsible journalism. This process will ensure the next generation includes citizens who are effective health science communicators and self-motivated learners with a deep connection to the role of biomedical research in their careers and future life. Youth program resources will be posted on the PBS NewsHour Extra site to serve its 700,000 annual users and our partner sites PBS Learning Media and Share My Lesson - the two biggest free education resource sites on the web. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To increase public health literacy, all sectors of society must have access to the highest-quality health science news and information possible, suited to their learning needs, cognitive capacities, and health concerns. Translation, packaging and broad dissemination is important to this goal: the stories matter. PBS NewsHour, the most trusted news in America, is ideally positioned to raise the level of discourse and decision making around public health issues through production of targeted health news stories and emerging issues in the biomedical field. Through SEPA funding, adaptation of PBS NewsHour's Student Reporting Labs and youth mentoring program has the potential to address health disparities and science literacy deficits and to build a new cadre of minority youth and youth from low socio-economic status communities who will have the discipline, creativity and critical thinking skills needed to be successful health science-literate citizens and advocates in their communities and for their peers.",PBS NewsHour Health Literacy and Student Reporting Labs: Broad expansion of journalism to increase bioscience literacy in America and support the next generation of biomedical science communicators,9330243,R25OD020212,"['Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' creativity ', ' Creativeness ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Decision Making ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Engineering ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Sciences ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Privatization ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Opinion ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' news ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stream ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Journalism ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' literate ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Public Health Education ', ' Public Health Training ', ' Public Health Instruction ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' Advanced Development ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' fundamental research ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health priorities ', ' Critical Thinking ', ' Evaluative Thinking ', ' Complex thinking ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' online course ', ' online curriculum ', ' E-course ', ' learning outcome ', ' social media ', ' teacher community ', ' team teaching ', ' teacher collaboration ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",OD,WETA TV 26,R25,2017,270000,0.07226840212646989
"Understanding and Improving Medicaid Use for Routine and Preventive Care among Women on Probation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has created an unprecedented opportunity for women with criminal justice involvement (CJI) to obtain health insurance coverage, primarily through Medicaid expansion in 32 states and the District of Columbia. The vast majority (77%) of women with CJI are on probation. The proposed study will investigate healthcare utilization among women on probation who have Medicaid, focusing on health literacy and other factors that influence type (e.g., urgent, routine) and venue (e.g., emergency department, community clinic) of care. Women with CJI are disproportionately low-income women of color who are strongly affected by health disparities, with much higher burdens of preventable and chronic health conditions than women without CJI. In addition to practical, social, and economic factors, the Institute of Medicine recognizes that poor health literacy is a major barrier to the use of preventive and routine care among disadvantaged populations. Poor health literacy is associated with lower likelihood of receiving preventive care and poorer outcomes for chronic health conditions. It also contributes to overuse of urgent and emergency care. Guided by the Health Literacy Skills Framework and the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, our research aims are as follows:  Aim 1: To identify health literacy and other enabling, impeding, and need factors that influence type (e.g., urgent, routine) and venue (e.g., emergency department, community clinic) of healthcare utilization in a cohort (n=360) of women on probation who have Medicaid.  Aim 2: To explore how criminal justice involvement, health literacy, and prior experiences navigating healthcare settings contextualize type and venue of healthcare utilization among a qualitative subsample (n=80) of women on probation who have Medicaid.  Aim 3: To use findings from Aims 1 and 2 to adapt an existing health literacy intervention designed for women with CJI, pilot the intervention with women on probation who have Medicaid (n=40), and assess its feasibility and acceptability for a larger efficacy study. The ultimate goal of the intervention would be to shift patterns of Medicaid utilization toward routine and preventive healthcare in community settings.  The proposed study is responsive to PAR-10-133 in its investigation of the influence of health literacy on a behavioral outcome (healthcare utilization) and the development of an intervention to address the specific health literacy needs of a vulnerable population. For women on probation, Medicaid utilization for preventive and routine health care may require specific, focused health literacy education and support. Knowledge from the proposed study will contribute to scholarship on the underlying causes of health disparities among women with CJI, the impact of Medicaid expansion under the ACA, and strategies to improve women’s health by increasing routine and preventive healthcare utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed mixed-methods study will investigate health literacy and other factors that influence type and venue of healthcare utilization among women on probation who have Medicaid. Knowledge gained will contribute to scholarship on the underlying causes of health disparities among women with criminal justice involvement. Findings also will be used to inform the adaptation of an intervention addressing health literacy, thereby advancing the applied research agenda to reduce health disparities.",Understanding and Improving Medicaid Use for Routine and Preventive Care among Women on Probation,9360569,R01MD010439,"['D.C.

"Student Wellness Champions for Change: engaging student leaders in enhancing wellness policy implementation through participation and advocacy Project Summary Despite decades of concentrated efforts across myriad sectors, childhood obesity remains a prevailing public health problem, and certain subpopulations, including racial and ethnic minorities and those living in low-income households, are disproportionately affected. Obese children are at higher risk for low quality of life and chronic disease diagnosis, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, in adulthood. Obesity is a complex disease with many influencing factors across the socio-ecological model, including individual, intrapersonal, environmental, policy, and systems-level factors. These factors vary across different social and cultural contexts, further complicating solutions to this widespread public health problem. Eliminating or reducing the childhood obesity burden will likely require a better understanding of not only which intervention strategies are effective to combat these influencing factors, but also whether these strategies can be similarly effective when translated across diverse cultures and contexts. To reach this understanding, researchers, interventionists, and practitioners will need to possess a unique analytic skillset, engage collaborators across multiple sectors, and demonstrate cultural sensitivity. The proposed training plan is designed to address these needs. First, the training plan incorporates cultural competency and health equity training. Second, it involves assembly of a mentoring and advisory team of scientists across disciplines (psychology, nutrition, communications, epidemiology, education). Third, it incorporates didactic training in multi-level modeling and mixed methods data analysis. Finally, the proposed research study allows for application of skills acquired through the training plan. The proposed research study examines the individual and environmental impact of Student Wellness Champions for Change, a health literacy, public health literacy, and youth advocacy-based intervention designed to engage student-led wellness teams in improving school wellness policy implementation and creating health-promoting environments in elementary and middle schools across Maryland. The project uses a rigorous mixed methods evaluation and the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework to assess (1) the extent to which involvement on student wellness teams improve students’ individual health behaviors, weight status, health and public health literacy, and youth advocacy skills; (2) the extent to which student wellness teams make environmental changes in their school. Additionally, the study aims to describe factors, including reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance, that are necessary to inform translation of this intervention strategy to diverse schools across Maryland and beyond. Project Narrative Childhood obesity is a pervasive problem in the United States, particularly among at-risk groups such as racial/ethnic minorities and low-income children. Formation of student-led wellness teams to encourage implementation of Local Wellness Policies (LWPs) and create a health-promoting school environment is a promising strategy to reduce obesity on a large scale, particularly in at-risk groups. This study investigates the effectiveness of student-led wellness teams on both school environment and individual-level outcomes, as well the extent to which these outcomes may be translatable across diverse populations and settings.",Student Wellness Champions for Change: engaging student leaders in enhancing wellness policy implementation through participation and

"Training At-Risk Industrial, Telecommunication and Immigrant Workers on How to Protect Themselves from Exposure to Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Products ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Steelworkers Charitable and Educational Organization (SCEO), the non-profit (501c3) arm of the United Steelworkers (USW), is applying for HWWTP, HDPTP and ECWTP funds to support a training partnership linking two of the largest U.S.-based industrial unions with rapidly expanding immigrant worker centers. The Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC), the SCEO's training entity, brings together the USW, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the Labor Institute (LI), and the National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON) and Make the Road New York (MRNY). In the next five years through these three submissions, the TMC will provide more than 65,000 workers and community residents with over 950,000 hours of training to help prevent toxic releases, fires, explosions, injuries, sickness and death. Through our proposed HWWTP five-year program, we will conduct 2,745 courses that will reach 55,950 workers, managers and community residents with 633,700 hours of training. To prevent fatalities, injuries, illnesses and releases of hazardous substances, we will focus WTP training and mentoring on H&S committee members and other activists who are in a position to help achieve concrete and lasting institutional changes at hundreds of U.S. worksites and communities. For our worker center partners, the focus will be on building a robust and widely dispersed H&S training capacity (in English and Spanish) for immigrant day-laborers and temporary workers who face a myriad of hazards on their ever-shifting worksites. The HDPTP program will establish a multi-lingual team of trainers (Specialized Emergency Response Trainers - SERTs) who are prepared to go anywhere at any time to provide training to emergency response and clean-up workers and community members engaged in massive man-made or weather-related disasters. To achieve this goal will dramatically increase the supply of Spanish language OSHA-certified Master Trainers who can conduct the full-range of HWWTP-related OSHA courses. We also will establish a SERTs infectious diseases working group to provide training expertise on donning and doffing high-level protective clothing and the proper use of related equipment to protect health care and hazardous waste workers. Our HDPTP program will offer 400 classes that will provide 9,050 at-risk workers and community residents with 119,000 contact hours. In the ECWTP program we will support and enhance workforce development programs conducted by MRNY in Queens and Brooklyn, NY, and the A. Philip Randolph Institute (APRI) in Pittsburgh, PA to place unemployed and underemployed workers in decent-paying occupations in construction, environmental cleanup and other green jobs. After providing 15 weeks of training for up to 450 workers over the term of the award, we will place at least 75 percent of these participants in good green jobs. Target Populations: The TMC has access to over 1.2 million USW/CWA workers and managers at facilities located in each U.S. state as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. They work in oil, chemical manufacturing, nuclear energy, pharmaceuticals, pulp, paper, automobile parts, appliance manufacturing, cement, metal manufacturing, construction, rubber, plastics, shipbuilding, light manufacturing, telecommunications, transportation, electrical manufacturing and health care. Approximately 850,000 of these workers are potentially exposed to hazardous substances covered by OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910, EPA 40 CFR 311, and DOT 49 CFR 171-177. The day laborers and temporary workers we will reach are employed in virtually every kind of clean-up activity, especially during emergencies, in addition to construction, car washes, cleaning, home care, warehousing and distribution. MRNY has over 16,000 members at its centers in New York in Bushwick, Jackson Heights, Port Richmond, Midland Beach, and Brentwood, Long Island. It is opening new centers in NJ, CT and PA. NDLON is a network of 45 day-laborer organizations in fifteen states and it estimates that approximately 5,000 workers pass through its centers nationwide each day.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 300 worker-trainers from the United Steelworkers (USW), the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), and Make the Road New York (MRNY) will provide hazardous waste training to front-line workers, communities and other-stakeholders in order to protect the worker health and safety, the public's health, and the environment. The workers we represent, who produce, dispose of, and transport billions of pounds of hazardous substances and wastes, will receive HAZWOPER and related OSHA training. Our combined HWWTP, HDPTP and ECWTP proposed five-year programs will conduct over 3,300 classes for 65,000 workers and residents, providing more than 900,000 hours of training.            ","Training At-Risk Industrial, Telecommunication and Immigrant Workers on How to Protect Themselves from Exposure to Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Products",9535324,U45ES006175,"['Academy ', ' Americas ', ' Automobiles ', ' Award ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carbon ', ' Chemistry ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dental Pulp ', ' pulp ', ' Disasters ', ' Dust ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Explosion ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Hazardous Chemicals ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Hazardous Waste ', ' Health ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mentors ', ' Metals ', ' New York ', ' Nuclear Energy ', ' Atomic Energy ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Oils ', ' Paper ', ' Plastics ', ' Poisons ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Program Development ', ' Protective Clothing ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Risk ', ' Rubber ', ' natural Rubber ', ' Latex Rubber ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' statistics ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telecommunications ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' Transportation ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States Virgin Islands ', ' Virgin Islands ', ' Waste Products ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Underemployment ', ' underemployed ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Workplace ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' patient home care ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' news ', ' Multilingualism ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Country ', ' Occupational ', ' meetings ', ' hazard ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' nanotechnological ', ' nanotech ', ' nano-technological ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' Committee Members ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' virtual ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' resilience ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' community organizations ', ' Long Island ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' Toxics Release Inventory ', ' arm ', ' Emergency response ', ' climate impact ', ' Workforce Development ', ' ']",NIEHS,STEELWORKER CHARITABLE/EDUCATIONAL ORG,U45,2018,2172545,0.06766243852285567

"Enhancing clinical trials participation though library partnerships Underrepresentation of health disparity populations in clinical trials has the potential to exacerbate and perpetuate health disparities. There are several notable barriers to clinical trials participation, however low research literacy may be a key barrier yet rarely addressed. Few tools exist for enhancing clinical trials research literacy and promoting clinical trials resources for consumers, and fewer yet have been specifically developed for minority and underrepresented populations. Developed in conjunction with 28 partner institutions associated with the NCI funded Cancer Disparities Research Network, we have developed a clinical trials research literacy tool intended to clearly and simply explain elements of research and trials that are understandable, usable and useful to will empower diverse consumers to make fully informed decisions when considering enrollment in clinical trials. We seek to leverage information technology and library partnerships to transform the research literacy materials into a web-based tool and evaluate implementation of the tool in libraries and hospital patient education centers. Due to their accessibility and roles as information gatekeepers, librarians and health providers that serve medically underserved underrepresented populations are promising partners for disseminating clinical trials information. Thus, we propose to employ a user-centered design process to transform our current card-based tool to a functional, and more easily accessible web-based tool for consumers and a supplemental training module for librarians and health providers. Iterative prototype development will involve focus groups, an environmental scan of available clinical trials resources to identify opportunities to enhance the tool with direct linkages to local clinical trials, and key informant interviews among librarians and healthcare providers to inform the development of a supplemental training module applicable across libraries and patient education centers. Following development of the tool, leveraging the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR), we will deploy the tool among 10 libraries and patient education centers to evaluate factors influencing implementation and clinical trials participation outcomes. Pre- post surveys among n=125 library and patient education center patrons using the tool will assess outcomes related to research literacy and intentions to engage in clinical trials. A survey among n=50 librarians, community organization leaders, community health workers and healthcare providers will identify factors influencing the implementation of the research literacy tool in libraries, community organizations and hospital patient education centers. Results will be used to develop a generalizable model for health system - public library partnerships to sustain and disseminate the tool to other settings. The participation of diverse populations in clinical trials is crucial to advancing science, discoveries, health care delivery and overall human health. There are many studies focused on barriers to diverse clinical trials enrollment, however there is little focus on the conversations that need to occur prior to approaching a potential participant in clinical trials- including a focus on: building trust, dispelling research participation myths, improving research literacy. This proposal aims to build on our low-tech version of our research literacy communication tool tested in diverse populations and transform it to a web-based version to disseminate to diverse populations to use in conjunction with their local librarians, community organizations/community health workers, and health care providers.",Enhancing clinical trials participation though library partnerships,9564185,G08LM012688,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Americas ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Computers ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Demography ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Evolution ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Health Science Library ', ' literacy ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Standardization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Librarians ', ' Measures ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Ensure ', ' Trust ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' Participant ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Modeling ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' Communication Tools ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Output ', ' implementation trial ', ' implementation research ', ' Information Technology ', ' Minority ', ' firearm violence ', ' gun violence ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' web-accessible ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' user centered design ', ' stem ', ' implementation science ', ' tool development ', ' prototype ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' arm ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' web-based tool ', ' All of Us Research Program ', ' ']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,G08,2018,99621,0.009785017466029413
"Information visualizations to facilitate clinician-patient communication in HIV care (Info Viz: HIV) PROJECT SUMMARY The research in this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award is aligned with the National Institute of Nursing Research’s scientific focus area of improving self-management strategies for individuals with chronic conditions. Additionally, this award will provide the protected time, advanced training, and research experience that the candidate needs to further develop her program of research aimed at promoting health and reducing health disparities among Latinos with low health literacy. This study builds on previous NIH-funded pre- and postdoctoral research (T32 NR013454, T32 NR007969) and aims to evaluate infographics which are evidence-based, culturally appropriate, and methodically designed images to facilitate clinician-patient HIV-related communication. HIV is a complex chronic illness for which effective self-management requires persons living with HIV (PLWH) to acquire, understand, and utilize large amounts of health information. By using rigorously designed and evaluated infographics during clinical encounters, clinicians may provide the information PLWH need for effective self-management in a more meaningful way.  During the first year of the K99, the candidate will assess the extent to which the infographics she developed through her postdoctoral work are a feasible and useful method to facilitate information exchange and improve outcomes among PLWH with low health literacy. To ensure cultural relevance, this feasibility trial of infographic use during clinical visits in a limited resource setting will take place at Clínica de Familia in La Romana in the Dominican Republic (DR). Beyond ensuring cultural appropriateness, this study builds on previous work conducted at the Clinic and a well-established relationship with the organization will ensure long-term project success. The second year of the K99 will take place at Columbia University School of Nursing in New York City, and will include advanced training in statistical analysis, design and implementation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), theory and measurement of acculturation and cultural influences on health, communication methods with individuals who have low health literacy, and automation of infographics through coursework, seminars, and interdisciplinary collaboration. During the R00 phase, a multi-site RCT will be used to assess the efficacy of using infographics during normal clinic visits to improve short, medium, and long- term treatment outcomes among PLWH in the United States (US) and in the DR. How infographic use influences clinician-patient communication and treatment outcomes in both settings will also be compared.  Through rigorous refinement and evaluation of a novel method to enhance HIV-related communication between health care providers and Latino PLWH with low health literacy in the US and abroad, findings will contribute to the evidence- base regarding methodically generated, culturally appropriate infographic design and communication methodologies that can lead to better health outcomes among Latino patients globally. Additionally, by ensuring the time and support needed to solidify her program of research, this award will advance the candidate towards becoming an independently funded nurse scientist seeking to promote health and reduce health disparities through evidenced-based informatics interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Effective self-management of chronic conditions, such as HIV infection, is dependent on the affected individual's ability to acquire, understand, and use relevant health information. Infographics are methodically designed images that can assist clinicians in communicating the specific information that patients need in a comprehensible and useable way. This project aims to evaluate and refine a set of culturally appropriate HIV-related infographics to facilitate clinician-patient communication and improve health outcomes for Latinos living with

"American Samoa Indigenous Samoan Partnership to Initiate REsearch Excellence (INSPIRE) in Colorectal Cancer Health Literacy Project Abstract Very little information regarding the health status of American Samoans are available, and the research infrastructure in America Samoa (AS) requires a sufficient foundation and capacity building to conduct large-scale population health research. The purpose of this project is to: (1) build the research capacity in America Samoa to conduct population health research, and (2) to support a pilot health research project that aims to increase colorectal cancer screening literacy among American Samoans so that initial data will be available and serve as the foundation for future research efforts in America Samoa. This project is a collaborative community and research engaged effort that reflects the community-identified priorities in AS addressing a research gaps in health promotion and cancer prevention. The percentage of American Samoan adults aged 50-75 obtaining CRC screening is far below the US national average, i.e., 7% of American Samoans vs. 58.2% of US adults. Assessment of health literacy levels has been recommended in specific populations and to use assessment results in developing targeted and tailored promotional programs. The proposed Indigenous Samoan Program to Initiate Research Excellence (INSPIRE) – CRC Literacy. (INSPIRE) aims to: (1) strengthen research capacity by providing technical assistance on research protocol, IRB training, and development of an easily accessed cancer data repository, (2) adapt/pilot the Short form Test of Functional Health Literacy – Adults (STOFHLA) and administer revision to a representative sample of older adults recruited through Respondent Driven Sampling methods, and (3) informed by STOFHLA results, develop and implement a culturally competent, linguistically appropriate, and theory-informed screening intervention, use of a 2 group pre-post control group comparison, with measurement of Knowledge-Attitude- Behavior (KAB) survey at several points of evaluation and assessment of the primary outcome namely, timely completion of Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT). INSPIRE efforts will be led by the AS Community Cancer Coalition in partnership with LBJ Tropical Medical Center (LBJTMC), the AS Department of Health and dedicated technical assistance from consultants associated with the University of Hawai`i and Azusa Pacific University in California, with consultant expertise in health literacy, RDS, cancer screening research, STOFHLA, community-based participatory approaches, multi-modal research/evaluation strategies, and history of positive collaboration with AS partners. This effort should result in increased screening use and contribute to building a foundation for future translational research. INSPIRE-produced research is significant for AS because it lays a much needed foundation for systematic public health research. Further, INSPIRE research will contribute to advancement in the science of health literacy and health promotions with/for resource-poor, yet tradition-rich Indigenous communities thereby, offering the hopeful prospect of eliminating socially-constructed and harmful health inequalities. Project Narrative INSPIRE aims are to increase research capacity in American Samoa and to conduct a pilot research project ton colorectal cancer screening literacy. INSPIRE-produced research is significant for AS because it lays a much needed foundation for systematic public health research by building local research capacity and providing initial key health data.

"Evaluating employment quality as a social determinant of health in a changing economy Project Summary This proposal address a major gap in our understanding of health disparities by considering the effects of employment conditions on population health. This research is particularly important as economic, social, technical, and political drivers are fundamentally transforming the nature and organization of work—especially the shift away from job security toward more “flexible” and competitive employment practices. In particular, there has been a decline in the so-called Standard Employment Relationship (SER; i.e., permanent, full-time, regularly-scheduled work, with secure wages and benefits) and concurrent rise in non-standard employment arrangements. Modifications in employment structures affect a significant portion of the U.S. workforce, but disproportionately impact women, people of color, immigrants, younger workers, and lower-skilled and lower- educated workers. Most studies of the relationship between work and health have focused on physical, chemical, and psychosocial exposures; however, the terms and conditions of the employee-employer relationship, identified as employment quality (EQ) characteristics, are increasingly being recognized as important work-related determinants of health. Prior health research has struggled with the conceptualization and measurement of EQ. While previous U.S. studies have mostly used single-dimensional approaches (e.g., non-permanent contracts), there is an emerging consensus that EQ should be conceived of as a multidimensional construct. However, studies using multidimensional constructs of EQ have been restricted to Europe and Canada, despite the fact that generalizability of European research to the U.S. context is limited due to large differences between the respective labor markets and social safety nets. To advance the conceptualization and measurement of EQ in the U.S., we propose to first develop a multidimensional construct of EQ using latent class analysis (LCA). The LCA procedure will assign workers into classes based on a set of objective indicators of employment arrangements. To operationalize EQ, we will leverage two representative population surveys containing rich information on a broad range of employment conditions of U.S. workers: the General Social Survey and the American Working Conditions Survey. We will then test whether EQ is associated with workers’ health and well-being, as well as important individual- and organizational-level characteristics. We will also examine if the distribution of EQ has changed between 2002 and 2014, and compare our results to prior European LCA studies that used similar EQ indicators. A particular focus of this research is to examine the potential mechanisms by which EQ may contribute to population health disparities, including by 1) characterizing the distribution of EQ across different sociodemographic groups, and 2) testing whether there is an interaction with attributes of EQ that produce differential health effects in these groups. This work is an essential step to further elucidating the role of employment in producing health and health disparities in complex modern economies. Project Narrative The dramatic changes in the organization of work over the last several decades have not been adequately examined from a public health perspective. This study will use advanced theoretical and analytic approaches to conceptualize a multidimensional construct of employment quality, defined as the terms and conditions of the employer-employee relationship that may affect workers’ health, and examine its distribution across sociodemographic groups and association with workers’ health. Given the strong connection between employment and health, improving precarious employment conditions may enhance the health of millions of Americans, and particularly benefit populations that are disproportionately impacted by low quality employment.",Evaluating employment quality as a social determinant of health in a changing economy,9608897,F31MD013357,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Canada ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Color ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Europe ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Job Satisfaction ', ' Work Satisfaction ', ' Labor Unions ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Modernization ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Schedule ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Immigrant ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Nature ', ' Consensus ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Employee ', ' Structure ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Fissural ', ' Security ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' demographics ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Secure ', ' urban residence ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2018,44524,0.04504725941146519
"Using Community-Engaged Methods to Design a Tool to Promote Informed Breast Cancer Screening Decisions for Low Literacy Women PROJECT SUMMARY Low health literacy (LHL) is increasingly recognized as an important driver of cancer disparities, and given that one in five Americans lack the necessary literacy skills to function adequately in our health care system, this is a burgeoning public health crisis. Adults with LHL are less likely to use preventive services, less likely to undergo cancer screening, and have higher mortality. Mammography screening decisions, which increasingly call for shared-decision making between patient and physician, is an exemplar of where communication challenges are most likely to affect outcomes for LHL populations. Informed decisions for breast cancer screening that account for individual risk of developing breast cancer and patient preferences are recommended by professional guidelines for women aged 40-54 for whom the harms of screening can exceed the benefits. While mammography screening is estimated to reduce breast cancer mortality by 15% for women in their 40s, screening in younger women has high rates of false positives (40-60% over ten years) and substantial estimates of over-diagnosis (15-48% of those screened). Data consistently show that communication about mammography screening inadequately prepares women for these outcomes and there are widespread misperceptions about mammography and its utility among women making screening decisions. While literacy is a known barrier to receiving mammography, there are currently no decision tools to help women with LHL with their decision-making. Therefore, the goal of this training and research program is to develop the necessary knowledge and skills to create and test a novel decision aid to increase informed breast cancer screening decisions for women ages 40-54 with LHL. Training will cover four essential domains: 1) Community-Engaged Research Methods; 2) Tools to Improve Informed Decision-Making; 3) Low Literacy Populations; and 4) Patient-Centered Outcome Assessment. The knowledge gained through didactic training and one-on-one mentoring will support three proposed Research Aims. First, I will engage multiple stakeholders, including women with LHL (n=25) and their clinicians (n=20), in qualitative interviews to understand and characterize their decisional preferences and identify outcomes that matter most. Second, I will construct a multi-media decision aid appropriate for use with women with LHL ages 40-54. An expert panel (n=10) will assist in evaluating the acceptability of evidence based content for inclusion, and women with LHL will provide input on tool acceptability and pilot outcomes via cognitive interviews and a survey (n=30). Third, I aim to assess the impact of the decision aid on decision-making outcomes (decisional conflict, knowledge, shared decision-making) and screening intentions through a pilot pre-test/post-test study among 50 women and their primary care providers. This work will launch my career as an independent investigator trained to design and disseminate patient-centered decision supports that help to optimize the delivery of cancer screening services for those with LHL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Literacy is a critical aspect of disparities research, and is particularly salient when aiming to support and improve decision-making in health care. This research will develop and test a multi-media decision aid for breast cancer screening with an explicit focus on the needs of women with low health literacy using community engaged methods, thus enhancing its translational potential. It will provide novel data on individual experiences with informed decision-making and the effects of a decision aid on patient-centered outcomes among a low health literacy population.",Using Community-Engaged Methods to Design a Tool to Promote Informed Breast Cancer Screening Decisions for Low Literacy Women,9597822,K07CA221899,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' literacy ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Suggestion ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Address ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Low Literacy Population ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' investigator training ', ' informant ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' shared decision making ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' young woman ', ' screening ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' mammography screening ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Information Literacy ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' screening disparities ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,K07,2018,129704,-0.027143104511673594
"Disparities in HIV/AIDS: Examining Retention in Care and Health Literacy (ENRICH) PROJECT SUMMARY  African Americans (AA) account for 40% of the nearly 1.2 million persons living with HIV/AIDS in the United States. Of the nearly 40,000 new annual HIV diagnoses, 45% occur among AAs. AAs also have the highest rates of AIDS diagnoses and are more likely to die from HIV/AIDS than any other racial/ethnic group. A major contributor to the morbidity and mortality of HIV/AIDS among AAs is poor retention in HIV/AIDS care. Of AAs who are diagnosed and linked to care, only 34% attend regularly scheduled HIV/AIDS medical appointments, the lowest retention in care among racial/ethnic groups. Poor retention in care is associated with higher HIV viral load, increased risk for viral transmission, and increased mortality. AAs also are at increased risk of low health literacy, which preliminary evidence suggests may contribute to reduced retention in care. Health literacy—the ability to access, process, and use health information to make informed health decisions— is associated with a variety of poor health outcomes, including poor utilization of available health services, low medication adherence, and increased mortality. Limited evidence is available regarding the effect of health literacy on retention in care. Previous research found that the odds of individuals attending more than 75% of their regularly scheduled HIV/AIDS visits doubled among those who knew the correct value of their HIV viral load or CD4 count. Personal HIV knowledge has also been associated with undetectable HIV viral load and increased CD4 count, but these findings are inconsistent across studies. Among non-HIV/AIDS populations, evidence suggests that health literacy may mediate the relationship between race and health outcomes, but this causal pathway has yet to been examined for retention in HIV/AIDS care. Due to the emerging evidence on the effects of health literacy in retention in care, as well as causal pathways linking health literacy and health outcomes among disparate populations, examination of these pathways on retention in care among AAs living with HIV/AIDS is a necessary next step. The purpose of this F31 fellowship, entitled ENRICH (Examining Retention in Care and Health Literacy), is to utilize an adapted health literacy model to evaluate the effect of health literacy on retention in care and its subsequent effect on racial disparities and HIV clinical outcomes. ENRICH is an ancillary study to a nearly completed R01 study (Project READ—R01 MH092284: PI, D. Waldrop-Valverde) that assessed the association of health literacy on medication discordance. ENRICH will include an additional prospective measure of retention in HIV/AIDS care and HIV clinical outcomes (HIV viral load), captured via medical chart review, among Project READ’s 700 study participants. ENRICH operationalizes retention in care as visit adherence, defined as the proportion of scheduled HIV/AIDS visits kept over a 24-month follow-up period. Reducing health disparities among HIV/AIDS patients is a priority of the Office of AIDS Research and this study will improve understanding of potentially modifiable contributors to health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Low health literacy and poor retention in HIV/AIDS care may contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality of HIV/AIDS among African Americans. The proposed study aims to understand the role of health literacy and retention in care on HIV/AIDS health disparities. Knowledge gained from this study will provide insight into mechanisms underlying health disparities among African Americans living with HIV/AIDS and may inform the development of interventions to improve health literacy and retention in care, in order to reduce health inequities.",Disparities in HIV/AIDS: Examining Retention in Care and Health Literacy (ENRICH),9481403,F31NR017580,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Fellowship ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' cognitive function ', ' Clinic ', ' Visit ', ' medical appointment ', ' AIDS diagnosis ', ' Valverde ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' AIDS Population ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' virus transmission ', ' viral transmission ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,0.12896428107221455
"Health Literacy Intervention to Improve Diabetes Outcomes among Rural Primary Care Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We will test the effectiveness and fidelity of embedding the American College of Physicians (ACP) diabetes health literacy intervention among patient-centered medical homes throughout rural Arkansas. Proper diabetes self-care requires patients to have considerable knowledge, a range of skills, and to sustain multiple health behaviors. Self-management interventions are needed that have been designed for individuals with lower literacy skills, that can be readily implemented and sustained among rural clinics with limited resources that disproportionately care for patients with limited literacy. Researchers on our team developed an evidence-based, patient-centered, low literacy ACP intervention promoting diabetes self-care that includes: 1) a diabetes guide that uses plain language and descriptive photographs to teach core diabetes concepts and empower patients to initiate behavior change; 2) a brief counseling strategy to assist patients in developing short-term, explicit and attainable goals for behavior change (`action plans'); 3) a training module for providers (physicians, nurses, medical assistants) that prepares them to assume educator/counselor roles with the Diabetes Guide as a teaching tool; 4) electronic tracking and monitoring tools for primary care practices. While the intervention has previously been field tested and found to significantly improve patient knowledge, self-efficacy, and engagement in related health behaviors, it has not yet been comprehensively tested in practices, and its optimal implementation is not known. We now have a unique opportunity to learn from our prior evaluation, modify and disseminate an ACP health literacy intervention among patients with type 2 diabetes cared for at rural clinics in Arkansas that are Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMH). These practices are embedding care coordination services that can be leveraged to improve chronic disease management. All are supervised by a new University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Center for Health Literacy. Our revised intervention will blend outsourced and clinic-based approaches and redeploy health coaches for counseling self-management mostly via phone, but also at the point-of-care. This is a feasible way to reach rural, vulnerable patients. We will conduct a patient-randomized, pragmatic clinical trial among 6 rural PCMHs in Arkansas, targeting individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Our primary aims are to: 1) test the effectiveness of the ACP diabetes health literacy intervention to improve a range of diabetes-related outcomes among rural patients; 2) compared to usual care, evaluate whether the intervention reduces disparities by patient literacy level. Our secondary aims are to: 3) investigate whether a threshold or gradient effect exists between the amount of follow-up counseling (number of action plans) and intervention effectiveness; 4) determine the fidelity of all intervention components, and explore any identified patient, provider (physician, nurse, health coach), and/or health system barriers to implementation; and 5) assess the costs associated with implementing the intervention from a health system perspective. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study aims to determine the best way to deliver diabetes care, education, and coaching to patients in rural areas so that patients at primary care clinics can be healthier and have fewer health problems resulting from diabetes. We will test two different ways to help patients through counseling, coaching, and written materials.",Health Literacy Intervention to Improve Diabetes Outcomes among Rural Primary Care Patients,9412831,R01DK107572,"['Arkansas ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Counseling ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Supervision ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Universities ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' behavior change ', ' Medical center ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' American College of Physicians ', ' point of care ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile computing ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' rural patients ', ' service coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' usual care control group ', ' usual care arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2018,647033,0.1627729740250669
"Kids SIPsmartER: A multi-level behavioral and health literacy intervention to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages among Appalachian middle-school students Project Summary: The intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB, e.g., soda/pop, sweet tea, sports and energy drinks, fruit drinks) is disproportionately high in Appalachia, including among adolescents whose intake is more than double the national average and more than four times the recommended daily amount. There are strong and consistent scientific data and systematic reviews documenting relationships among high SSB consumption and numerous chronic health conditions such obesity, some types of obesity-related cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dental erosion and decay. Reaching adolescents with behaviorally- focused health programs where they spend the majority of their time, at school, shows promise. However, engaging caregivers who serve as their child’s most influential role model as well as the gatekeeper for the home environment may be equally as important in changing adolescents’ SSB behaviors. Finally, there is a great need to understand how to support schools and teachers to deliver and maintain evidence-based health education programs, especially among rural schools. Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is to work in partnership with Appalachian middle schools to implement and evaluate Kids SIPsmartER. Kids SIPsmartER is a 6-month, school-based, behavior and health literacy curriculum aimed at improving SSB behaviors among middle school students. The program also integrates a two-way short service message (SMS) strategy to engage caregivers in SSB role modeling and supporting home SSB environment changes. Kids SIPsmartER is grounded by the Theory of Planned Behavior as well as health literacy, media literacy, numeracy, and public health literacy concepts. In our proposed cluster-randomized controlled trial, we target 12 middle schools in medically underserved Appalachian counties in southwest Virginia. Our study is guided by the RE-AIM (reach, adoption, effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance) framework and is a type 1 hybrid design. The primary aim is to assess changes in SSB behaviors at 7-months among 7th grade students at schools receiving Kids SIPsmartER, as compared to control schools. We will also evaluate changes in secondary student outcomes (e.g., BMI, quality of life, theory-related variables), changes in caregiver outcomes (e.g., SSB behaviors, home SSB environment), and 19-month maintenance of outcomes. The reach and representativeness of Kids SIPsmartER will be assessed. Furthermore, we will use a mixed-methods approach with interviews, surveys, observation, and process evaluation strategies to determine the degree to which teachers implement Kids SIPsmartER as intended and the potential for institutionalization within the schools. The long-term goal of this health promotion and prevention line of research is to establish an effective, scalable, and sustainable multi-level strategy to improve SSB behaviors and reduce SSB-related health inequities and chronic conditions (e.g. obesity, cancer, type II diabetes, heart disease, dental caries) in rural Appalachia. Project Narrative: Excessive sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) consumption among Appalachian adolescents is well-established and is associated with numerous chronic health conditions (e.g., obesity, some cancers, type II diabetes, heart disease, dental caries). Collaborating with local Appalachian school systems to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-level intervention strategies to reduce SSB consumption among middle- school students and their caregivers has important public health implications. The public health relevance of this prevention and disparities focused research is further signified by our efforts to promote and determine the capacity of partnering school districts to implement and sustain the multi-level SSB reduction intervention.",Kids SIPsmartER: A multi-level behavioral and health literacy intervention to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages among Appalachian middle-school students,9495908,R01MD012603,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Environment ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Hybrids ', ' Influentials ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' School Teachers ', ' Schools ', ' Sports ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tea ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Transportation ', ' Virginia ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' teacher ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' sugar ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Review Literature ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' mathematical ability ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' seventh grade ', ' 7th grade ', ' Prevention ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' junior high school ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Seminal ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' systematic review ', ' health literacy ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' soda ', ' soft drink ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Obesity related cancer ', ' Obesity associated cancer ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' Consumption ', ' medically underserved ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' High School Student ', ' student teacher ', ' pre-service teacher ', ' future faculty ', ' Preservice teacher ', ' Future Teacher ', ' school district ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2018,820221,0.07990504851519156
"El Trabajo no te Debe Dañar: Reduction of Hazardous Exposures in Small Businesses through a Community Health Worker Intervention PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to reduce negative health outcomes in small businesses that primarily employ high-risk Latino workers by characterizing their exposures to hazardous chemicals and assessing if a community health worker (CHW) intervention is effective at decreasing these exposures. Although preventable by definition, occupational disease and injuries are leading causes of death in the United States, with a disproportionate burden faced by Latinos. Small businesses pose a particular risk. They are more likely to employ low-wage Latino workers, and often use hazardous solvents including volatile organic chemicals that can cause asthma, cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological disease; yet their workers lack access to culturally and linguistically appropriate occupational health and pollution prevention information due to economic, physical, and social barriers. CHW-led interventions and outreach in Latino communities have documented increased access to health care and health education and reduced workplace exposures among farmworkers. CHWs are an innovative method to bridge the gap between these small business communities and other stakeholders. The proposed project will capitalize on established partnerships between the University of Arizona, the Sonora Environmental Research Institute, Inc. and the El Rio Community Health Center. A community-engaged research framework will be used to complete the following specific aims: 1) quantify and identify exposures to hazardous chemicals in the two high risk small business sectors common in our target area (i.e., auto repair shops and beauty salons); 2) work collaboratively with business owners, trade groups, workers and CHWs to design an industrial hygiene – enhanced CHW intervention tailored for each small business sector; and 3) conduct a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the CHW intervention at reducing workplace exposures to volatile organic compounds and assess which factors led to successful utilization of exposure control strategies in both male and female-dominated businesses. Businesses will be randomized to either an intervention or delayed intervention group, both of which will receive incentives to participate including worksite health screenings. CHWs will work closely with business owners and employees to select and implement exposure-strategies appropriate for their worksite using a menu of complementary strategies of varying complexity and cost. This innovative project has the potential to directly reduce occupational health disparities through a CHW intervention that moves beyond providing occupational health education. The intervention will overcome current barriers by helping marginalized Latino workers and small business owners who may have limited education, literacy, and computer skills to understand the hazards associated with their work, and will empower them to have greater control over their occupational exposures, with the ultimate goal of preventing occupational disease and reducing health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Occupational exposures contribute to minority health disparities. This study will formally evaluate if a community health worker intervention can effectively reduce workplace exposures in marginalized small businesses to hazardous chemicals. Through face-to-face encounters, this study will increase the capacity of workers with limited education, literacy, and computer skills to understand workplace hazards and effective control options to reduce exposures and prevent occupational disease.",El Trabajo no te Debe Dañar: Reduction of Hazardous Exposures in Small Businesses through a Community Health Worker Intervention,9469272,R01ES028250,"['Air Pollution ', ' Arizona ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Beauty ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Workers ', ' Computers ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Government Programs ', ' Hazardous Chemicals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incentives ', ' Industry ', ' Labor Unions ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' literacy ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Occupational Diseases ', ' occupational disorder ', ' occupational disease/disorder ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' Organic Chemicals ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Solvents ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Industrial Health ', ' Industrial Hygiene ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Businesses ', ' Information Protection ', ' Latino ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Workplace ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Individual ', ' occupational health/safety ', ' Exposure to ', ' farm worker ', ' farmworker ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Occupational ', ' empowered ', ' hazard ', ' Employee ', ' skills ', ' research study ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Reproducibility ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' minority health ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' Pollution Prevention ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Occupational injury ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2018,600354,0.02788269235191267
"Translating Obesity and Diabetes Prevention into the Worksite for Immigrant Popul DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and diabetes are serious health problems in the United States, with rapidly increasing prevalence and incidence over the last 10 years. National data document alarming increases in overweight and obesity, and among Latinos the prevalence is 78%, markedly higher than in the general population. An estimated 25.6 million people 20 years or older have diabetes in the U.S., with the greatest increases in prevalence among racial and ethnic minority populations, further complicated by disparities in socioeconomic status. Hispanics face a diabetes prevalence twice that of non-Hispanic whites and suffer higher rates of diabetes complications and mortality. Nationally, it is estimated that there are over 2.6 million hired farm workers in the U.S., and California is among the largest employers of these workers. In California, over 450,000 people are employed in agriculture, with more than two-thirds being of Latino ethnicity. Most are immigrants with low levels of education and many have Spanish as their only language. This population also faces issues with limited access to health care, compounded by poverty and low socioeconomic status. While intervention efforts have demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle approach promoting diet and physical activity can significantly reduce obesity and diabetes incidence, there continues to be a need for effective programs designed for underserved and immigrant populations - a sizeable proportion of the U.S. working population. The overall goal of this study is to validate the effectiveness of an obesity and diabetes intervention among low-literate immigrant farm workers. We propose that a lifestyle intervention delivered at the agricultural worksite will improve obesity and diabetes risk for employees and will prove to be cost effective for the employer. The collaboration of established investigators at UC Davis with Reiter Affiliated Companies (RAC, a large berry grower in California) and the Health Initiative of the Americas at UC Berkeley (experts in organizing health campaigns for underserved immigrant populations) creates a unique opportunity to achieve significant positive health outcomes through a total worker health approach. Our efforts will build upon two successful pilot studies conducted with RAC and will enable us to reach a larger number of people and evaluate the program's translation and sustainability potential. Successful achievement of the project goals will enable dissemination of the program to improve the health of workers via a cost effective and culturally-tailored obesity and diabetes risk factor intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interventions, such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), have demonstrated that moderate lifestyle changes can significantly reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes incidence. Our approach is to deliver a obesity and diabetes lifestyle intervention in a culturally resilient context and integrated into a workplace setting. This intervention is designed to reach farm working and other immigrant Latino workers in low-wage industries, a large and growing population with an elevated risk for obesity and diabetes in the U.S. Additionally, the project includes an economic evaluation to appraise long-term sustainability, an important consideration for employers considering health and wellness programs.",Translating Obesity

"COMPRENDO: Adaptation and Implementation of a Peer-Navigation Intervention to Improve Research Literacy and Diversity in Pediatric Leukemia Clinical Trials ABSTRACT Childhood cancer is the leading cause of child death by disease past infancy in the US. While survival has improved, mainly due to patient participation in clinical trials, critical racial/ethnic disparities remain. Compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) children, Hispanics have higher incidence of leukemia and poorer survival rates. Although Hispanics will comprise 33% of the U.S. childhood population by 2060, their participation in biomedical research is critically low and, as shown in our prior work, Hispanics are underrepresented in pediatric cancer research. As a result, outcomes data are obtained mostly from NHW. Our preliminary data, and research from others, suggest that adequate informed consent and low research literacy (capacity to understand and act on information to make decisions about research) are barriers to minority participation in clinical trials. Interventions to improve research literacy and clinical trial participation, particularly for Hispanics, are lacking. There is an urgent need to fill this gap in knowledge, as tailored interventions guided by implementation science can improve research literacy and minority participation in clinical trials. The objective of this K08 is to improve research literacy in parents of children with leukemia by adapting (from the patient- navigation model) and implementing “COMPRENDO” (ChildhOod Malignancy Peer REsearch NavigatiOn), a tailored peer-navigation intervention (PNI). Our hypothesis and rationale are that PNIs guided by implementation science, in which trained peers deliver culturally and linguistically concordant education to parents during informed consent, can identify and address barriers to: a) adequate research literacy, and b) equitable clinical trial participation. By increasing minority participation in clinical trials, we can effectively translate discoveries and treatments, and, ultimately, improve equity of survival in diverse populations, which is a top priority for NCI. We propose to implement COMPRENDO to improve parental research literacy in pediatric leukemia clinical trials, using mixed-methods and implementation science (Aim 1). We will compare the effectiveness of COMPRENDO vs. usual care in improving research literacy outcomes among parents of children with leukemia (Aim 2) using a Hybrid Trial Type 1 effectiveness and implementation design. We hypothesize that, compared to usual care, parents randomized to the PNI will show higher comprehension, voluntariness, and accrual and lower mistrust post informed consent discussion and 4 weeks post intervention. This K08 award builds on the formative work of the PI in bioethics and pediatric cancer disparities and maps on to the PI’s training goals in implementation science, intervention adaptation, qualitative methods, and behavioral clinical trial design. This K08 has an important impact: knowledge gained can be generalized to Hispanics across the lifespan and will help to: a) inform clinical care, and b) design a multi-site randomized clinical trial, in which COMPRENDO will be tested in a larger sample of Hispanics with a broader range of cancers in a future R01, enabling the PI’s transition to independence as a successful physician-scientist. NARRATIVE Whereas Hispanic children will comprise 33% of the U.S. population and have higher incidence of certain cancers, their participation in biomedical research is critically low and they have poorer survival rates than non- Hispanic Whites.

"Community Health Workers and teleaudiology as a culturally-relevant approach to improving access to hearing health care Many rural and under-resourced areas lack audiology services, exacerbating hearing health care disparities. In the United States, hearing loss impacts an estimated 50 million individuals aged 65 years and older. Access to hearing aid rehabilitation can improve health outcomes, yet an uneven geographic distribution of audiologists across the U.S. results in communities that lack services. In teleaudiology, an audiologist delivers care to a patient from a remote workplace via videoconferencing technology, minimizing the barrier of geography. Evidence has demonstrated the clinical equivalence of teleaudiology to face-to-face procedures, including in the area of hearing aid fitting and verification. However, additional barriers to accessibility affecting disparity populations, including socioeconomic and cultural differences, are known to contribute to poor health service utilization. In teleaudiology, a facilitator is located at the patient site to assist with hands-on tasks, under the supervision of the remote audiologist. Community Health Workers may be a feasible patient-site support for teleaudiology due to their established role in health promotion for disparity populations. For decades, Community Health Workers have supported a number of disease-specific (e.g. Diabetes) and general health areas by providing community-receptive health education, patient advocacy, and integrating with patient-care teams. Given their established history of addressing disparities in a vast range of other health areas, Community Health Workers have been identified for their emergent role in reducing disparities in access to hearing health care (Marrone et al., 2017; Marrone, Ingram et al., 2016). The proposed research builds on the Sponsors’ ongoing research with an established Community Health Worker program serving Hispanic/Latino older adults with hearing loss. The proposed study aims to test the feasibility of an innovative approach in which Community Health Workers serve as the patient-site support for teleaudiology. The hypothesis is that providing evidence-based audiology services delivered via teleaudiology with patient-site support from Community Health Workers will lead to improved access to care, and therefore improved hearing health outcomes. In this project, remote hearing aid fittings will be delivered by an audiologist with patient-site support from a Community Health Worker for a cohort of older adults (>65 years) from a rural area that has been identified as under-resourced for hearing health care. Hearing aid benefit will be measured quantitatively via standardized patient-reported outcome measures, and qualitatively via focus groups. We expect hearing aid benefit to be improved at 3 months in an immediate intervention group relative to a waitlist comparison group, and for outcomes to be maintained at 6 months. The proposed research and training plans are supported by a multidisciplinary team of researchers with a longstanding history of collaboration across audiology, public health, telemedicine, and community health. The overall goal aligns with the NIDCD research priority to generate evidence for high-quality, accessible hearing health care in under-resourced areas. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Millions of older Americans face barriers to accessing hearing health care that would otherwise improve health and functioning with hearing loss. Teleaudiology has emerged as a solution for bridging gaps in care, particularly for rural and underresourced populations. Results from this culturally-relevant teleaudiology project will inform future translational research to adapt evidence-based teleaudiology interventions acceptable for diverse populations.

"Optimizing the Home Literacy Environment for Children with Clefts ABSTRACT  Children with oral clefts are at increased risk for learning problems compared to unaffected children. Deficits are observed in multiple academic areas, and are most pronounced in reading and language-mediated skills. Despite these findings, there are no published studies testing the effectiveness of intervention or prevention efforts to offset these disparities. The long-term goal for this research is to create treatment and research protocols that would enable us to complete the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a parent- focused literacy intervention. We plan to model this intervention after the Reach Out and Read program that has been used successfully in pediatric primary care settings with infants at elevated risk for poor literacy and academic achievement outcomes. Adaptations will include strategies to facilitate implementation in craniofacial team care settings, delivered by speech/language pathologists, and to tailor the intervention to the needs of children with oral clefts. The specific aims for this treatment development (R34) proposal include: (1) Evaluate acceptability and feasibility in traditionally under-represented families (e.g., Latino/Hispanic families, children from low socioeconomic backgrounds), and in craniofacial team settings; (2) Create written protocols for the implementation of an RCT (e.g., treatment manual, research protocol and manual of operations); and (3) Establish collaboration between participating centers (Seattle Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital Los Angeles).

"Delineating Hispanic Immigrants' Allostatic Load Dynamics through Systems Modeling ! ABSTRACT Problem: Low-wage/skill Hispanic immigrant workers (e.g., lodging/foodservice) live and work in environments, shaped by structural policies that generate disproportionate pathogenicity over time. Within these contexts, workers experience excess allostatic load (AL) accumulation (cumulative wear/tear on the body's systems that result from repeated adaptation to diverse stressors), which is associated with syndemic states (e.g., overweight/obesity, hyperlipidemia, cardiometabolic disease). [Syndemics denote the presence of mutually/adversely reinforcing disease states exacerbated by inequities associated with sociopolitical/economic milieux.] Existing research, grounded in linear conceptualizations and statistical modeling, has generated informative but limited insights into Hispanic immigrant worker health disparities. These approaches yielding low-leverage interventions that produce inconsequential results have been a critical barrier to the understanding and subsequent reduction of these disparities. Our solution: To use a novel approach that draws on syndemics, systems science, and dynamic simulation modeling methodologies to effectively capture the underlying, dynamically-complex etiology of Hispanic immigrant worker health disparities, with potential to lead to impactful structural policy interventions. The overall aim of this proposal is to understand how multifaceted and interacting government/corporate structural policies influence excess AL accumulation for Hispanic Immigrant Lodging/Foodservice workers (HILF) and their associated syndemic risks, and to identify preventive policy interventions that can reduce syndemic risks over time. Specific aims are to: (1) Uncover the complex drivers of AL accumulation and associated syndemic risks for HILF workers over time and (2) Ascertain high-leverage intervention points and structural policies that can effectively reduce the AL-associated syndemic risk trajectories of HILF workers. This line of work will make significant contributions to immigrant worker health disparities research because of the concurrent: (a) conceptualization of immigrant worker health as a dynamically complex system and (b) employment of system dynamics methodological and analytical frameworks that can maximize intervention efforts by identifying needed policy changes to aid in designing impactful interventions. This project matches the goals of the R15 AREA mechanism. As UCF has not been a major recipient of NIH funding, the award would: (1) strengthen UCF's health research environment and increase its health funding; (2) enhance opportunities for interdisciplinary faculty collaborations; (3) and expose under/graduate students in hospitality management and engineering to interdisciplinary research on immigrant worker health disparities and stimulate interest in pursuing higher education degrees or careers in the behavioral/social health sciences. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Low-wage/skill/status Hispanic immigrant service-sector workers live and work in environments that are shaped by structural factors and that generate disproportionate disease risk. This proposal aims to use innovative systems science methods to understand how and which factors influence Hispanic immigrant lodging/foodservice workers disease risk over time, how past responses have impacted this risk, and which interventions can best reduce disease risk and ultimately reduce health disparities. The successful completion of the study has potential to contribute to the field and shed new light on immigrant health disparities and maximize intervention efforts by identifying critical structural factors needed for sustainable prevention.",Delineating Hispanic Immigrants' Allostatic Load Dynamics through Systems Modeling,9590961,R15MD011502,"['Award ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Hospital Administration / HMO ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Immigration ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' insight ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' graduate student ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Behavioral ', ' allostatic load ', ' neglect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' model building ', ' higher education ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R15,2018,470425,0.05757369128908627
"Improving Routine Asymptomatic Cancer Screening among Federally Qualified Health Center Users in Florida: Application of a Health Literacy Framework ABSTRACT As a recently appointed tenure-track Assistant Professor of Public Health, my long-term career goal is to make a meaningful contribution to the elimination of cancer disparities. In doing this, I wish to establish myself as a nationally-recognized independent investigator with expertise in the use of health communication to address cancer disparities. I have substantial training in behavioral research, primarily focused on understanding the role of various social and cultural factors on cancer disparities. Building on this foundation, I require additional training to fill gaps related to the design, implementation, and evaluation of health communication interventions. My Mentorship Team and I have prepared a comprehensive career development plan that consists of mentorship, coursework, expert consultations, workshops, experiential learning, and an innovative research project. My proposed research plan aligns with my overarching career goal in seeking to improve routine cancer screening within federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), where the burden of cancer is greater compared to the general population, but screening rates are much lower than national averages. Despite the significant contribution of routine screening in the reduction of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, disparities persist among racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic (SES) populations who continue to underutilize screening. FQHCs can be invaluable partners in reducing these disparities due to their sliding-fee pay structure and location in medically underserved areas. The goal of the proposed K01 research project is to understand how current FQHC users perceive routine asymptomatic cancer screening, and develop and pre- test an eHealth tool that promotes screening among FQHC users. The specific aims are to: (1) Conduct formative research with FQHC users to understand how they perceive and make decisions about routine asymptomatic cancer screening; (2) Design and pre-test an eHealth tool that addresses each domain of the health literacy framework, and incorporates key decision criteria of asymptomatic cancer screening among FQHC users; and (3) Pilot test an eHealth intervention within an FQHC setting aimed at delivering literacy appropriate, “decision- relevant” information about routine asymptomatic cancer screening to FQHC users. This Mentored Research Award would provide the necessary protected time to achieve the following training goals: (1) Develop expertise in the application of decision analysis to health communication, within a health literacy framework; (2) Become familiar with clinic operations, user profiles, and service delivery within FQHCs, along with successful research collaboration with FQHCs; (3) Build competence in health communication intervention design, implementation, and evaluation; and (4) Develop the necessary skills to translate communication research into practice, specifically within an FQHC setting. This research would set the stage for a larger R01-level health communication intervention study. Findings might inform not only cancer screening, but also other health promotion interventions in FQHCs, which are increasingly becoming medical homes for low SES populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The long-term goal of this research is to increase routine asymptomatic screening rates for breast, cervical and CRC among low income, uninsured, low socioeconomic (SES) populations, ultimately reducing cancer disparities. The proposed study will address the gap in our understanding of how current FQHC users perceive routine asymptomatic cancer screening; and be the first to apply ethnographic decision tree modeling within a health literacy framework to address the complex cancer decision-making processes of uninsured and low SES populations.",Improving Routine Asymptomatic Cancer Screening among Federally

"Understanding and Improving Medicaid Use for Routine and Preventive Care among Women on Probation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has created an unprecedented opportunity for women with criminal justice involvement (CJI) to obtain health insurance coverage, primarily through Medicaid expansion in 32 states and the District of Columbia. The vast majority (77%) of women with CJI are on probation. The proposed study will investigate healthcare utilization among women on probation who have Medicaid, focusing on health literacy and other factors that influence type (e.g., urgent, routine) and venue (e.g., emergency department, community clinic) of care. Women with CJI are disproportionately low-income women of color who are strongly affected by health disparities, with much higher burdens of preventable and chronic health conditions than women without CJI. In addition to practical, social, and economic factors, the Institute of Medicine recognizes that poor health literacy is a major barrier to the use of preventive and routine care among disadvantaged populations. Poor health literacy is associated with lower likelihood of receiving preventive care and poorer outcomes for chronic health conditions. It also contributes to overuse of urgent and emergency care. Guided by the Health Literacy Skills Framework and the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, our research aims are as follows:  Aim 1: To identify health literacy and other enabling, impeding, and need factors that influence type (e.g., urgent, routine) and venue (e.g., emergency department, community clinic) of healthcare utilization in a cohort (n=360) of women on probation who have Medicaid.  Aim 2: To explore how criminal justice involvement, health literacy, and prior experiences navigating healthcare settings contextualize type and venue of healthcare utilization among a qualitative subsample (n=80) of women on probation who have Medicaid.  Aim 3: To use findings from Aims 1 and 2 to adapt an existing health literacy intervention designed for women with CJI, pilot the intervention with women on probation who have Medicaid (n=40), and assess its feasibility and acceptability for a larger efficacy study. The ultimate goal of the intervention would be to shift patterns of Medicaid utilization toward routine and preventive healthcare in community settings.  The proposed study is responsive to PAR-10-133 in its investigation of the influence of health literacy on a behavioral outcome (healthcare utilization) and the development of an intervention to address the specific health literacy needs of a vulnerable population. For women on probation, Medicaid utilization for preventive and routine health care may require specific, focused health literacy education and support. Knowledge from the proposed study will contribute to scholarship on the underlying causes of health disparities among women with CJI, the impact of Medicaid expansion under the ACA, and strategies to improve women’s health by increasing routine and preventive healthcare utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed mixed-methods study will investigate health literacy and other factors that influence type and venue of healthcare utilization among women on probation who have Medicaid. Knowledge gained will contribute to scholarship on the underlying causes of health disparities among women with criminal justice involvement. Findings also will be used to inform the adaptation of an intervention addressing health literacy, thereby advancing the applied research agenda to reduce health disparities.",Understanding and Improving Medicaid Use for Routine and Preventive Care among Women on Probation,9502189,R01MD010439,"['Affect ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"American Samoa Indigenous Samoan Partnership to Initiate REsearch Excellence (INSPIRE) in Colorectal Cancer Health Literacy Project Abstract Very little information regarding the health status of American Samoans are available, and the research infrastructure in America Samoa (AS) requires a sufficient foundation and capacity building to conduct large-scale population health research. The purpose of this project is to: (1) build the research capacity in America Samoa to conduct population health research, and (2) to support a pilot health research project that aims to increase colorectal cancer screening literacy among American Samoans so that initial data will be available and serve as the foundation for future research efforts in America Samoa. This project is a collaborative community and research engaged effort that reflects the community-identified priorities in AS addressing a research gaps in health promotion and cancer prevention. The percentage of American Samoan adults aged 50-75 obtaining CRC screening is far below the US national average, i.e., 7% of American Samoans vs. 58.2% of US adults. Assessment of health literacy levels has been recommended in specific populations and to use assessment results in developing targeted and tailored promotional programs. The proposed Indigenous Samoan Program to Initiate Research Excellence (INSPIRE) – CRC Literacy. (INSPIRE) aims to: (1) strengthen research capacity by providing technical assistance on research protocol, IRB training, and development of an easily accessed cancer data repository, (2) adapt/pilot the Short form Test of Functional Health Literacy – Adults (STOFHLA) and administer revision to a representative sample of older adults recruited through Respondent Driven Sampling methods, and (3) informed by STOFHLA results, develop and implement a culturally competent, linguistically appropriate, and theory-informed screening intervention, use of a 2 group pre-post control group comparison, with measurement of Knowledge-Attitude- Behavior (KAB) survey at several points of evaluation and assessment of the primary outcome namely, timely completion of Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT). INSPIRE efforts will be led by the AS Community Cancer Coalition in partnership with LBJ Tropical Medical Center (LBJTMC), the AS Department of Health and dedicated technical assistance from consultants associated with the University of Hawai`i and Azusa Pacific University in California, with consultant expertise in health literacy, RDS, cancer screening research, STOFHLA, community-based participatory approaches, multi-modal research/evaluation strategies, and history of positive collaboration with AS partners. This effort should result in increased screening use and contribute to building a foundation for future translational research. INSPIRE-produced research is significant for AS because it lays a much needed foundation for systematic public health research. Further, INSPIRE research will contribute to advancement in the science of health literacy and health promotions with/for resource-poor, yet tradition-rich Indigenous communities thereby, offering the hopeful prospect of eliminating socially-constructed and harmful health inequalities. Project Narrative INSPIRE aims are to increase research capacity in American Samoa and to conduct a pilot research project ton colorectal cancer screening literacy.

"Building environmental health literacy: What should people know about endocrine disrupting compounds? PROJECT SUMMARY Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in everyday environments and consumer products can interfere with the body's natural hormone signaling. Examples include some pesticides, fragrances, flame retardants, ingredients in plastics and personal care products, and highly fluorinated substances. While different levels of evidence are available for different chemicals, major scientific bodies now agree there is sufficient evidence of harmful health effects to recommend exposure reduction. The Endocrine Society found support for links to obesity, diabetes, male and female reproduction, cancer, thyroid disruption, and neurodevelopmental effects. To make personal and public decisions about EDCs, people need a functional understanding about these chemicals, including where they come from, how they enter the body and affect health, and options for reducing exposure. This information constitutes EDC environmental health literacy (EDC-EHL). Health literacy is a significant factor in health outcomes and disparities, and EHL is expected to similarly influence individual and population health by supporting positive health behavior. However, interviews with participants who were biomonitored for EDCs reveal only a partial understanding of these exposures, suggesting significant gaps in most people's EDC-EHL. Effective communications must fill these gaps and correct misconceptions while remaining grounded in people's existing knowledge and beliefs. To improve communications, this project will be the first effort to (1) define functional environmental health literacy about everyday EDC exposures and (2) develop and test methods for assessing EDC-EHL. Aim 1 will develop a mental model of EDC-EHL through a series of focus groups. Participants will include researchers and community partners conducting EDC studies, many of whom are supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). This aim will establish goals for public EDC-EHL. Aim 2 will develop an interactive, web-based survey to quantitatively assess people's knowledge and beliefs in comparison with the model from Aim 1. The design will incorporate game-like elements, and participants will receive personalized feedback to stimulate curiosity and motivate completion. The survey will be hosted on LabintheWild, a proven online research platform for behavioral studies, and will be mobile-friendly, since smartphones provide internet access for many people. LabintheWild attracts participants via social media, and partnerships with community organizations and a major employer will improve representation among older, less educated, and racially diverse demographics. The target 1,500 responses will provide preliminary data about EDC-EHL in the general population, and future research can leverage the survey in studies of large representative samples, specific groups, or interventions. Results from both aims will inform effective communications about EDCs and health, meeting a need identified by medical societies and scientific panels and providing immediate guidance for outreach in NIEHS research centers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Health literacy—the ability to obtain and understand health information to make health decisions—is a significant factor in health outcomes and contributes to health disparities. This project extends health literacy to environmental health and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in consumer products, which are recognized as a public health hazard by major scientific bodies. This project provides the foundation for creating effective communications about EDCs and health by (1) defining a model of what people need to know to make informed decisions and (2) gathering preliminary data on people's understanding of the model using a novel, quantitative, web-based instrument.",Building environmental health literacy: What should people know about endocrine disrupting compounds?,9455570,R03ES027884,"['Affect ', ' Androgens ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Belief ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Curiosities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Flame Retardants ', ' Fire Retardants ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Pesticides ', ' Plastics ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Medical Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thyroid Hormones ', ' Thyroid Gland Hormone ', ' Translating ', ' Health Hazards ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Social Network ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Food Packaging ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Level of Evidence ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Distant ', ' Source ', ' health knowledge ', ' Endocrine ', ' meetings ', ' consumer product ', ' health science research ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' endocrine disrupting compound ', ' Endocrine disrupting agent ', ' Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals ', ' Endocrine Disrupter ', ' Endocrine Disruptors ', ' Outcome ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' population health ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' social media ', ' Formulation ', ' personal care products ', ' thyroid hormone disruption ', ' thyroid disruption ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' recruit ', ' hormone signals ', ' hormonal signals ', ' ']",NIEHS,SILENT SPRING INSTITUTE,R03,2018,74000,0.1231097805364131
"The impact of health literacy, culture and psychosocial factors on the Pap testing behaviors of African immigrant women in the United States PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In sub-Saharan Africa, cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death, with 68,000 new cases detected each year, and a high percentage remaining undiagnosed. In the United States (U.S), an introduction of the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, a low-cost early detection procedure, has resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of cervical cancer. However, African immigrant women (AIW), a fast-growing immigrant population in the US, face a disproportionate burden of disease, and their worse cancer outcomes have been attributed to low Pap testing. Studies of other immigrant groups such as Asians and Hispanics, have shown that limited health literacy, the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions, is associated with poor cancer screening. However, there is a dearth of research on how this phenomenon presents among AIW, and the pathways by which health literacy impacts Pap testing are unclear. Within the African cultural context, informal communication methods are used to disseminate women’s health information, and may play a crucial role in influencing health literacy. Therefore, sources (family/relatives, friends, ethnic church, TV/Radio, internet, social media, physician) and types (verbal, written text, pictures) of health information exchange are suggested as possible mechanism by which health literacy is influenced and health behavior such as Pap testing are adopted. The purpose of this mixed methods study is to understand how sources and types of health information impact health literacy and ultimately, Pap testing behaviors among AIW in the US. The study will address these specific aims: (1) Examine the relationships of the number of sources and types of health information with the level of health literacy among AIW; (2) Examine the mechanism through which sources and types of health information and health literacy impact Pap testing behaviors among AIW; (3) Explore how sources of health information influence AIW Pap testing behaviors and how they seek health information using open-ended interviews; (4) Describe how sources/types of health information impact health literacy and information sharing to guide Pap testing. The project is guided by an adapted Health Literacy Skills framework, a conceptual model which addresses the determinants of health literacy, and the relationship between health literacy and Pap testing. A comprehensive and disease specific instrument validated in immigrant populations will be the primary measure of health literacy. This study is aligned with the NCI strategic mission to improve health outcomes among minority populations. This training plan will begin a program of research to understand the complex interaction among health literacy, culture, and psychosocial determinants of Pap testing. This study will inform the development of culturally tailored interventions to promote Pap testing to help decrease the burden of cervical cancer and cancer disparities among underserved African immigrant women. PROJECT NARRATIVE Limited health literacy is a major barrier to cancer prevention behaviors—particularly among underserved racial/ethnic minority populations such as African immigrant women. Among African immigrant women, cancer is diagnosed at a significantly later stage, and they are also among the least likely ethnic/racial groups to receive cervical cancer screening compared to African Americans, Asian and Hispanic immigrants. This proposed study seeks to understand how sources and types of health information exchange impacts health literacy, and how health literacy influences Pap testing behaviors among AIW living in the US.","The impact of health literacy, culture and psychosocial factors on the Pap testing behaviors of African immigrant women in the United States",9570635,F31CA221096,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Services ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Preventive Health Services ', ' Preventative health service ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cervical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Church ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Communication Methods ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Radio ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' social media ', ' Information Literacy ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,40470,0.1658181447793723
"Health Literacy Assessment and Intervention to Reduce Disparities: FLIGHT/VIDAS II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is a critically important skill that helps people to become active participants in their health care. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy showed that more than 75 million Americans had basic health literacy skills, indicating that as many as 1 in 4 Americans can have difficulty understanding information about their healthcare. Persons in racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have even lower levels of health literacy. Twenty-four percent of blacks (9.5 million persons) and 41% of Hispanics (21 million persons) have below basic levels of health literacy. These persons have lower levels of health literacy and compelling evidence, including our own findings (see below), link race and ethnicity to disparities in health via health literacy. Members of minority groups and older adults are more frequently affected by chronic diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, asthma, hepatitis C, HIV infection, mental health disorders and many others. The twin burdens of chronic disease and low levels of health literacy thus fall disproportionately on those most in need - members of minorities and older adults, all of whom likely to experience one or more chronic conditions while often not having the health literacy skills to help them cope. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a logical target for a general health literacy intervention. In an approach that cuts across specific diseases. CDSM targets problems and skills needed to cope with issues such as fatigue, pain, stress, depression, sleep disturbance and treatment adherence. Studies show that in- person CDSM classes improve patients' functioning and reduce healthcare utilization, but their availability is limited due to the lack of qualified personnel and cost. Similarly, while interventions have been developed to improve health literacy, they are difficult to scale to levels needed to meet the challenge of low health literacy (for more than 40 million persons) due to their cost. Effective interventions with the potential for wider dissemination at reasonable costs are urgently needed. In a previous study, we showed that a computer-delivered tailored information intervention targeting health literacy that can deployed either as an information kiosk in a clinical office or n the Internet could be cost- effective in improving patients' health literacy and adherence. It is nt clear, however, whether the same sort of computer-delivered, multimedia and interactive approach will be effective in improving CDSM skills in persons with low baseline levels of health literacy, and if it is, whether its effects will extend beyond health literacy to general health, slf-efficacy, activation, and treatment adherence.

"Care2bWell: A Worksite Physical Activity & Wellness Program for Child Care Staff DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are approximately 1.3 million US child care workers, most of who are hourly employees and classified as low-wage earners. In North Carolina, half of these workers are African American or Hispanic. Many have no health insurance, putting them at increased risk for many serious and chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Regular physical activity (PA) is known to decrease risk of many chronic diseases; unfortunately, most Americans, especially low-income individuals and minorities, fail to meet PA recommendations. A multi-level worksite-based PA intervention offered in child care is an innovative strategy to reach these low wage workers and address health disparities among this high-risk population. While the primary target of our intervention is worker PA, we expect that healthier and more physically active workers will be better role models and promoters of healthy lifestyles for children in their care. This two-arm, cluster RCT (n=104 centers, with 4 workers/center) will test the efficacy of a 6-month Care2bWell (CARE) intervention in increasing workers' PA compared to a Financial Empowerment (FE) control arm. The CARE intervention will include a kick-off workshop, where participants get tailored feedback about their health risks and set behavioral goals, followed by three 2-month long wellness campaigns, during which workers monitor PA, receive tailored feedback, and compete in teams for prizes. Center directors will take part in monthly webinars focused on improving the work environment to support PA and wellness. Within a social ecological framework, Perceptual Control, Social Support, and Diffusion of Innovation theories guide intrapersonal, interpersonal, and center- level intervention components. Participants in the FE arm will receive a parallel intervention to enhance financial health at the individual and center levels. The primary outcome will be accelerometer-measured minutes of moderate to vigorous PA. Primary and secondary outcomes (diet, anthropometrics, psychosocial variables, & center wellness environments) will be assessed at baseline, follow-up (6 mo), and maintenance (18 mo). Detailed process evaluation, cost-effectiveness, and meditational analysis will be used to assess mechanisms of behavior change at the individual and center levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: People who work in lower paying jobs without health insurance, such as child care workers, are at increased risk for many chronic diseases (obesity, heart disease, diabetes). Physical activity can help reduce risk for most of these conditions. A multi-level, child care-based, worksite wellness intervention could be an effective strategy for reaching this high risk population of low-wage workers. Improving workers' health and physical activity is a direct benefit to workers, and helps them become healthy role models for children in their care.",Care2bWell: A Worksite Physical Activity &

"PBS NewsHour Health Literacy and Student Reporting Labs: Broad expansion of journalism to increase bioscience literacy in America and support the next generation of biomedical science communicators ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using a combination of high quality broadcast and Web-streamed news reports on emerging public health concerns, youth-generated videos addressing health-related topics, and online curriculum resources, PBS NewsHour will engineer successful public health education experiences that engage the American public, students of all backgrounds - particularly those in underserved populations - to explore biomedical research and emerging health science information as it emerges in academic institutions, private laboratories and public health institutions throughout the country. To identify cutting edge storie of concern to the American public, PBS NewsHour will commission an annual survey of priority public health concerns and then, using that crowdsourced material, work with a blue-ribbon medical advisory council to help identify key experts and material to support in-depth journalism into those topics. The NewsHour aims to engage with the public on issues that are on their minds but then take the reporting to the next level, so that people understand not only what is at stake for them personally, but how what is happening in labs and universities translates into new advances and developments. Social media will be used both to engage with the public and to promote this content. Through this funding and using these stories produced by the award winning PBS NewsHour medical reporting team as a focus, the PBS NewsHour's Student Reporting Labs will experiment with an adaptation of its successful science program to work with eight Labs to produce unique news stories that view health science topics from a youth perspective. These videos will become part of a comprehensive set of lesson plans and learning tools disseminated online to the general public, educators and youth media organizations to draw attention to American health and biomedical issues and careers. Students will be supported with curricula and mentorship on fundamental research practice and the critical thinking skills necessary for responsible journalism. This process will ensure the next generation includes citizens who are effective health science communicators and self-motivated learners with a deep connection to the role of biomedical research in their careers and future life. Youth program resources will be posted on the PBS NewsHour Extra site to serve its 700,000 annual users and our partner sites PBS Learning Media and Share My Lesson - the two biggest free education resource sites on the web. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To increase public health literacy, all sectors of society must have access to the highest-quality health science news and information possible, suited to their learning needs, cognitive capacities, and health concerns. Translation, packaging and broad dissemination is important to this goal: the stories matter. PBS NewsHour, the most trusted news in America, is ideally positioned to raise the level of discourse and decision making around public health issues through production of targeted health news stories and emerging issues in the biomedical field. Through SEPA funding, adaptation of PBS NewsHour's Student Reporting Labs and youth mentoring program has the potential to address health disparities and science literacy deficits and to build a new cadre of minority youth and youth from low socio-economic status communities who will have the discipline, creativity and critical thinking skills needed to be successful health science-literate citizens and advocates in their communities and for their peers.",PBS NewsHour Health Literacy and Student Reporting Labs: Broad expansion of journalism to increase bioscience literacy in America and support the next generation of biomedical science communicators,9544340,R25GM129222,"['Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Creativeness ', ' creativity ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Engineering ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Sciences ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Privatization ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Opinion ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' news ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stream ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Journalism ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' literate ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Public Health Education ', ' Public Health Training ', ' Public Health Instruction ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' Advanced Development ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Mind ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' fundamental research ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health priorities ', ' Evaluative Thinking ', ' Complex thinking ', ' Critical Thinking ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' online curriculum ', ' E-course ', ' online course ', ' learning outcome ', ' social media ', ' team teaching ', ' teacher collaboration ', ' teacher community ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIGMS,WETA TV 26,R25,2018,270000,0.07226840212646989
"Mechanisms of Health Literacy and Information Accessibility in the Deaf Project Summary Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users are nearly seven times more likely to have inadequate health literacy when compared with their hearing peers. This population is the non-English speaking minority group at greatest risk for miscommunication in health care settings. Health literacy mechanisms for Deaf individuals remain poorly understood, thereby limiting interventions to address health literacy disparities and their impact on health care. It is unclear how differences in attitudes, knowledge, and skills related to health information affect health literacy in Deaf populations and how they may contribute to ongoing health inequities. The two primary objectives of this proposal are: 1) to elucidate the role of information marginalization on health literacy in Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users and 2) to better understand the mechanisms of health literacy in this population so as to identify viable targets for future health literacy intervention development. This proposal is responsive to PAR-10-133's request for studies that assess mechanisms underlying health literacy, including roles of cognition, culture, language fluency, and information-seeking and interpretation ability in the deaf population and, how these may differ from the hearing population. To meet the study objectives, we will employ an explanatory sequential mixed methods design using extensive quantitative data collection procedures, namely, cross-sectional surveys and measures that will identify predictors and moderators of health literacy with 450 Deaf and 450 hearing subjects across three geographically diverse sites. These results will inform the subsequent qualitative assessment that will help explain the quantitative results, and elucidate how and why Deaf individuals access and understand health information. We will incorporate cutting edge technology to assess health information-seeking and interpretation patterns in this population, in addition to using a variety of validated and ASL -accessible instruments to assess health literacy and other constructs related to health literacy. The diverse team, consisting of both leading deaf and hearing researchers, provides a unique insight into how health information is distributed and disseminated visually. This approach has the potential to generate rich data on how to formulate health information and health literacy interventions for individuals with hearing loss. Public Health Relevance (Project Narrative) The public health impact of this study is its ability to understand potential differences in attitudes, knowledge, and skills related to health information between deaf and hearing populations and their degree of impact on health literacy. This research will assist us with improving existing health literacy interventions and tailor future approaches suitable to address the ongoing health inequities seen in the deaf population.",Mechanisms of Health Literacy and Information Accessibility in the Deaf,9543821,R01DC014703,"['Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' health attitude ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Deafness ', ' Knowledge acquisition ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' literacy ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Misinformation ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' health knowledge ', ' Hearing Impaired Persons ', ' Persons With Hearing Impairments ', ' Hard of Hearing Persons ', ' Deaf ', ' visual learning ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' social ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' cognitive ability ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' Information Literacy ', ' Learning Skill ', ' Formulation ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' American Sign Language ', ' recruit ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,645487,0.2447143757633736
"Breast Cancer Screening: Priorities and Attitudes of Diverse Women Under 50 PROJECT SUMMARY Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death and the leading cause of premature mortality for women in the U.S. Women who are racial/ethnic minorities experience an unequal burden of the disease. Breast cancer screening mammography guidelines for women aged 40-49 years are controversial. The potential benefit of avoiding an advanced cancer is often emphasized, while minimizing the frequency of possible harms. Conflicting recommendations for age at initiation and frequency of screening mammography for women aged 40-49 years highlight concerns related to the benefits and harms of screening. These conflicting recommendations leave women confused about when to initiate screening, how often to be screened, what sources to trust, and can undermine informed decision-making about screening mammography. Women from diverse racial/ethnic groups and those with limited health literacy are particularly vulnerable to misunderstanding screening recommendations. Health literacy is the degree to which one has the ability to obtain, process, understand, and use health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions. Those with limited health literacy have difficulty navigating the health care system, making health care decisions, and utilizing cancer screening, all contributing to disparities in cancer care. Health literacy is often a more powerful predictor of health disparities than more well-established predictors such as education and race/ethnicity. Moreover, individuals from traditionally medically underserved communities (e.g., racial/ethnic minority, low socioeconomic status [SES]) are at higher risk for lower health literacy, which can also reduce participation in cancer screening. This project will compare the intersections and differences between how Latina, Black, and non-Latina White women consider the benefits and harms associated with breast cancer screening mammography. The goal of this project is to create decision support tools for Latina, Black, and non-Latina White women with varying levels of health literacy under age 50 considering breast cancer screening mammography.

"""The Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Communities Worker Health and Safety Training Program"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Dillard University Deep South Center for Environmental Justice hazardous Waste Worker Training Center provides training to hazardous material and waster workers who may perform jobs covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standards and assist employers with complying with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120. The Consortium's goal is unique in that its emphasis is on underserved populations in both its Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program (HWWTP) and its Environmental Careers Worker Training Program (ECWTP).  The proposed HWWTP component has been designed to provide model occupational safety and health training for workers who are or may be engaged in activities related to hazardous waste removal, containment or chemical response. The emphasis however, is on servicing workers of entities where health and safety training is critical to the worker's wellbeing and possibly the safety and health of the public, but due to circumstances beyond the individual worker's control, (s)he is unlikely to receive sufficient training at either the quality or quantity needed to ensure safety and health. Such entities include emergency responders and city workers in small municipalities and or cities where budgeting restraints or working conditions (such as no release time), greatly reduces or eliminates the possibility of training. Volunteer fire departments and small county police forces, city health department employees, port authority workers and mosquito control division employees are examples of workers the Consortium has trained. Additionally, HBCUs with smaller budgets have been shown to receive some of the highest fines for non-compliance with applicable regulations. Small minority and disadvantaged businesses typically lack the capital to participate in high cost compliance training programs. The Consortium has targeted these entities for the proposed HWWT program.  The proposed ECWTP component has been designed to deliver comprehensive worker training to increase the number of underrepresented and disadvantaged minority adults employed in the fields of environmental restoration, hazardous materials and construction. The goals for this program are: (1) to serve underrepresented and disadvantaged adults living near hazardous waste and or contaminated property at risk of exposure to ambient hazards; and also (2) to provide additional pre-employment services that are inclusive of basic skills (i.e. study skills, math, reading, life skils) to increase program retention and completion; and (3) to successfully place trainers in jobs in the environmental restoration and construction fields. The added value of this training is not just that it increases sustainable employment opportunities for residents of beleaguered communities engulfed in situations of poverty and pollution, but that by investing in these particular individuals promotes economic stability, addresses health disparities and advances environmental justice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The HBCU and Communities Consortium Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program is uniquely designed to reach populations for training that have historically, due to poverty and or racism, been disenfranchised and excluded from opportunities existing within society. It also addresses basic inequities in resources for different communities across the country (rural vs urban) and differences in priorities for municipalities and city agencies, with training being first to be cut. Additionally, the Consortium is unique in its make-u in that it includes Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) that by design, serve the selected target population.            ","""The Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Communities Worker Health and Safety Training Program""",9534624,U45ES010664,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Asbestos ', ' Budgets ', ' Capital ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Workers ', ' Containment ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disasters ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Goals ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Hazardous Waste ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Industry ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mining ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mosquito Control ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Sector ', ' Reading ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Societies ', ' sound ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration ', ' Occupational Safety and Health Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Occupational Safety ', ' Businesses ', ' Police Forces ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Hazardous Waste Sites ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' racism ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' heat-related illness ', ' Heat Stress Syndromes ', ' Heat Stress ', ' Heat Stress Disorders ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' restraint ', ' Molds ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Hour ', ' restoration ', ' Country ', ' non-compliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' non-compliant ', ' Services ', ' hazard ', ' authority ', ' Employee ', ' Municipalities ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' skills ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' safety education ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' first responder ', ' emergency service responder ', ' emergency service personnel ', ' Emergency responder ', ' emergency service/first responder ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' remediation ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' chemical release ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' volunteer ', ' gulf coast ', ' health training ', ' public health relevance ', ' environmental justice ', ' operation ', ' Emergency response ', ' climate impact ', ' Study Skills ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority student ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NIEHS,TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY,U45,2018,1231265,0.049632996012657846
"American Samoa Indigenous Samoan Partnership to Initiate REsearch Excellence (INSPIRE) in Colorectal Cancer Health Literacy Project Abstract Very little information regarding the health status of American Samoans are available, and the research infrastructure in America Samoa (AS) requires a sufficient foundation and capacity building to conduct large-scale population health research. The purpose of this project is to: (1) build the research capacity in America Samoa to conduct population health research, and (2) to support a pilot health research project that aims to increase colorectal cancer screening literacy among American Samoans so that initial data will be available and serve as the foundation for future research efforts in America Samoa. This project is a collaborative community and research engaged effort that reflects the community-identified priorities in AS addressing a research gaps in health promotion and cancer prevention. The percentage of American Samoan adults aged 50-75 obtaining CRC screening is far below the US national average, i.e., 7% of American Samoans vs. 58.2% of US adults. Assessment of health literacy levels has been recommended in specific populations and to use assessment results in developing targeted and tailored promotional programs. The proposed Indigenous Samoan Program to Initiate Research Excellence (INSPIRE) – CRC Literacy. (INSPIRE) aims to: (1) strengthen research capacity by providing technical assistance on research protocol, IRB training, and development of an easily accessed cancer data repository, (2) adapt/pilot the Short form Test of Functional Health Literacy – Adults (STOFHLA) and administer revision to a representative sample of older adults recruited through Respondent Driven Sampling methods, and (3) informed by STOFHLA results, develop and implement a culturally competent, linguistically appropriate, and theory-informed screening intervention, use of a 2 group pre-post control group comparison, with measurement of Knowledge-Attitude- Behavior (KAB) survey at several points of evaluation and assessment of the primary outcome namely, timely completion of Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT). INSPIRE efforts will be led by the AS Community Cancer Coalition in partnership with LBJ Tropical Medical Center (LBJTMC), the AS Department of Health and dedicated technical assistance from consultants associated with the University of Hawai`i and Azusa Pacific University in California, with consultant expertise in health literacy, RDS, cancer screening research, STOFHLA, community-based participatory approaches, multi-modal research/evaluation strategies, and history of positive collaboration with AS partners. This effort should result in increased screening use and contribute to building a foundation for future translational research. INSPIRE-produced research is significant for AS because it lays a much needed foundation for systematic public health research. Further, INSPIRE research will contribute to advancement in the science of health literacy and health promotions with/for resource-poor, yet tradition-rich Indigenous communities thereby, offering the hopeful prospect of eliminating socially-constructed and harmful health inequalities. Project Narrative INSPIRE aims are to increase research capacity in American Samoa and to conduct a pilot research project ton colorectal cancer screening literacy.

"Health Literacy Intervention to Improve Diabetes Outcomes among Rural Primary Care Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We will test the effectiveness and fidelity of embedding the American College of Physicians (ACP) diabetes health literacy intervention among patient-centered medical homes throughout rural Arkansas. Proper diabetes self-care requires patients to have considerable knowledge, a range of skills, and to sustain multiple health behaviors. Self-management interventions are needed that have been designed for individuals with lower literacy skills, that can be readily implemented and sustained among rural clinics with limited resources that disproportionately care for patients with limited literacy. Researchers on our team developed an evidence-based, patient-centered, low literacy ACP intervention promoting diabetes self-care that includes: 1) a diabetes guide that uses plain language and descriptive photographs to teach core diabetes concepts and empower patients to initiate behavior change; 2) a brief counseling strategy to assist patients in developing short-term, explicit and attainable goals for behavior change (`action plans'); 3) a training module for providers (physicians, nurses, medical assistants) that prepares them to assume educator/counselor roles with the Diabetes Guide as a teaching tool; 4) electronic tracking and monitoring tools for primary care practices. While the intervention has previously been field tested and found to significantly improve patient knowledge, self-efficacy, and engagement in related health behaviors, it has not yet been comprehensively tested in practices, and its optimal implementation is not known. We now have a unique opportunity to learn from our prior evaluation, modify and disseminate an ACP health literacy intervention among patients with type 2 diabetes cared for at rural clinics in Arkansas that are Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMH). These practices are embedding care coordination services that can be leveraged to improve chronic disease management. All are supervised by a new University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Center for Health Literacy. Our revised intervention will blend outsourced and clinic-based approaches and redeploy health coaches for counseling self-management mostly via phone, but also at the point-of-care. This is a feasible way to reach rural, vulnerable patients. We will conduct a patient-randomized, pragmatic clinical trial among 6 rural PCMHs in Arkansas, targeting individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Our primary aims are to: 1) test the effectiveness of the ACP diabetes health literacy intervention to improve a range of diabetes-related outcomes among rural patients; 2) compared to usual care, evaluate whether the intervention reduces disparities by patient literacy level. Our secondary aims are to: 3) investigate whether a threshold or gradient effect exists between the amount of follow-up counseling (number of action plans) and intervention effectiveness; 4) determine the fidelity of all intervention components, and explore any identified patient, provider (physician, nurse, health coach), and/or health system barriers to implementation; and 5) assess the costs associated with implementing the intervention from a health system perspective. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study aims to determine the best way to deliver diabetes care, education, and coaching to patients in rural areas so that patients at primary care clinics can be healthier and have fewer health problems resulting from diabetes.

"Improving Routine Asymptomatic Cancer Screening among Federally Qualified Health Center Users in Florida: Application of a Health Literacy Framework ABSTRACT As a recently appointed tenure-track Assistant Professor of Public Health, my long-term career goal is to make a meaningful contribution to the elimination of cancer disparities. In doing this, I wish to establish myself as a nationally-recognized independent investigator with expertise in the use of health communication to address cancer disparities. I have substantial training in behavioral research, primarily focused on understanding the role of various social and cultural factors on cancer disparities. Building on this foundation, I require additional training to fill gaps related to the design, implementation, and evaluation of health communication interventions. My Mentorship Team and I have prepared a comprehensive career development plan that consists of mentorship, coursework, expert consultations, workshops, experiential learning, and an innovative research project. My proposed research plan aligns with my overarching career goal in seeking to improve routine cancer screening within federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), where the burden of cancer is greater compared to the general population, but screening rates are much lower than national averages. Despite the significant contribution of routine screening in the reduction of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, disparities persist among racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic (SES) populations who continue to underutilize screening. FQHCs can be invaluable partners in reducing these disparities due to their sliding-fee pay structure and location in medically underserved areas. The goal of the proposed K01 research project is to understand how current FQHC users perceive routine asymptomatic cancer screening, and develop and pre- test an eHealth tool that promotes screening among FQHC users. The specific aims are to: (1) Conduct formative research with FQHC users to understand how they perceive and make decisions about routine asymptomatic cancer screening; (2) Design and pre-test an eHealth tool that addresses each domain of the health literacy framework, and incorporates key decision criteria of asymptomatic cancer screening among FQHC users; and (3) Pilot test an eHealth intervention within an FQHC setting aimed at delivering literacy appropriate, “decision- relevant” information about routine asymptomatic cancer screening to FQHC users. This Mentored Research Award would provide the necessary protected time to achieve the following training goals: (1) Develop expertise in the application of decision analysis to health communication, within a health literacy framework; (2) Become familiar with clinic operations, user profiles, and service delivery within FQHCs, along with successful research collaboration with FQHCs; (3) Build competence in health communication intervention design, implementation, and evaluation; and (4) Develop the necessary skills to translate communication research into practice, specifically within an FQHC setting. This research would set the stage for a larger R01-level health communication intervention study. Findings might inform not only cancer screening, but also other health promotion interventions in FQHCs, which are increasingly becoming medical homes for low SES populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The long-term goal of this research is to increase routine asymptomatic screening rates for breast, cervical and CRC among low income, uninsured, low socioeconomic (SES) populations, ultimately reducing cancer disparities. The proposed study will address the gap in our understanding of how current FQHC users perceive routine asymptomatic cancer screening; and be the first to apply ethnographic decision tree modeling within a health literacy framework to address the complex cancer decision-making processes of uninsured and low SES populations.",Improving Routine Asymptomatic Cancer Screening among Federally

"Sexual  Health  Empowerment  for  Jail-Involved  Women's  Health  Literacy  and  Prevention ABSTRACT  Over the last 35 years, there has been a 700% increase in the number of women in prisons and jails. These women, mostly women of color, have pervasive trauma histories, mental health problems, and drug use, all of which compromise their ability to engage in preventive health behaviors. For the last eight years, our research team has studied women leaving jail and why they are 4-5 times more likely to develop cervical cancer, a disparity that has remained unchanged for over 50 years. The original objective of the Sexual Health Empowerment (SHE) for Cervical Health Literacy and Prevention program (R01 CA181047) was to assess the effectiveness of a jail-based intervention to increase cervical health literacy and screening. SHE increased jailed women’s cervical health literacy and rates of cancer screening after the women left jail.  While delivering SHE, we observed: 1) the cross-cutting nature of women’s health risk factors, i.e. the risks that jailed women faced for cervical cancer also could lead to other women’s health problems; and 2) opportunity for taking an evidence-based intervention, with a rich theoretical framing, to expand to other women’s health issues faced by this group, around, not only cervical cancer prevention, but also breast cancer, unintended pregnancy, and STI prevention. While following women after release from jail (85% follow-up rate after 3 years), we also identified strategies for reaching this high-risk population through electronic communication. SHE participants were high users of mobile phones (88%), text (76%), Web (79%), and Facebook (70%). This renewal application presents an opportunity to holistically address health disparities experienced by women leaving jail and test new modalities for intervention delivery given their use of electronic communication and social media.  In our first aim, we will assess the feasibility and pilot effectiveness of ‘SHE-Women’, an electronic women’s health literacy intervention, with women leaving jail. The second aim uses an RCT to test the effectiveness of SHE-Women with women leaving jail on increasing women’s health literacy, screening, and risk reduction practices (for cervical, breast cancer, unintended pregnancy, and STIs) against a standard of care. Our third aim will be to understand the role and impact of human interaction in electronic interventions by tracking participants and interviewing key stakeholders. Knowledge gained from this study will lead to an understanding of: 1) how a comprehensive women’s health literacy intervention can narrow health disparities among justice-involved women and 2) the role of human interaction in successful electronic interventions, thereby creating a sustainable model for dissemination of health promotion interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The key contributions of this study are to determine whether a comprehensive women’s health literacy intervention is effective at changing intersecting behaviors among women leaving jail; whether an electronic women’s health literacy intervention is feasible and effective; and how much human “touch” is ideal in an electronic intervention. Knowledge gained from this study will help develop a new paradigm for mitigating health disparities among vulnerable women.",Sexual  Health  Empowerment  for  Jail-Involved  Women's  Health  Literacy  and  Prevention,9737397,R01CA181047,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Color ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Communities ', ' Discharge Plannings ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' Justice ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' literacy ', ' Literacy Programs ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Perception ', ' Prisons ', ' Productivity ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' falls ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Cervical ', ' Left ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' uptake ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Nature ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Knowledge ', ' behavior change ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Health Educators ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Jail ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Text ', ' post intervention ', ' birth control ', ' health literacy ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' health empowerment ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' pregnant ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' social media ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' STI prevention ', ' sexually transmitted infection prevention ', ' sexually transmitted disease prevention ', ' prevent sexually transmitted infections ', ' prevent sexually transmitted disease ', ' STD prevention ', ' Facebook ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,319410,0.05584073631507868
"Community Health Workers and teleaudiology as a culturally-relevant approach to improving access to hearing health care Many rural and under-resourced areas lack audiology services, exacerbating hearing health care disparities. In the United States, hearing loss impacts an estimated 50 million individuals aged 65 years and older. Access to hearing aid rehabilitation can improve health outcomes, yet an uneven geographic distribution of audiologists across the U.S. results in communities that lack services. In teleaudiology, an audiologist delivers care to a patient from a remote workplace via videoconferencing technology, minimizing the barrier of geography. Evidence has demonstrated the clinical equivalence of teleaudiology to face-to-face procedures, including in the area of hearing aid fitting and verification. However, additional barriers to accessibility affecting disparity populations, including socioeconomic and cultural differences, are known to contribute to poor health service utilization. In teleaudiology, a facilitator is located at the patient site to assist with hands-on tasks, under the supervision of the remote audiologist. Community Health Workers may be a feasible patient-site support for teleaudiology due to their established role in health promotion for disparity populations. For decades, Community Health Workers have supported a number of disease-specific (e.g. Diabetes) and general health areas by providing community-receptive health education, patient advocacy, and integrating with patient-care teams. Given their established history of addressing disparities in a vast range of other health areas, Community Health Workers have been identified for their emergent role in reducing disparities in access to hearing health care (Marrone et al., 2017; Marrone, Ingram et al., 2016). The proposed research builds on the Sponsors’ ongoing research with an established Community Health Worker program serving Hispanic/Latino older adults with hearing loss. The proposed study aims to test the feasibility of an innovative approach in which Community Health Workers serve as the patient-site support for teleaudiology. The hypothesis is that providing evidence-based audiology services delivered via teleaudiology with patient-site support from Community Health Workers will lead to improved access to care, and therefore improved hearing health outcomes. In this project, remote hearing aid fittings will be delivered by an audiologist with patient-site support from a Community Health Worker for a cohort of older adults (>65 years) from a rural area that has been identified as under-resourced for hearing health care. Hearing aid benefit will be measured quantitatively via standardized patient-reported outcome measures, and qualitatively via focus groups. We expect hearing aid benefit to be improved at 3 months in an immediate intervention group relative to a waitlist comparison group, and for outcomes to be maintained at 6 months. The proposed research and training plans are supported by a multidisciplinary team of researchers with a longstanding history of collaboration across audiology, public health, telemedicine, and community health. The overall goal aligns with the NIDCD research priority to generate evidence for high-quality, accessible hearing health care in under-resourced areas. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Millions of older Americans face barriers to accessing hearing health care that would otherwise improve health and functioning with hearing loss. Teleaudiology has emerged as a solution for bridging gaps in care, particularly for rural and underresourced populations. Results from this culturally-relevant teleaudiology project will inform future translational research to adapt evidence-based teleaudiology interventions acceptable for diverse populations.

"Mobile Health intervention for rural atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent, morbid condition. Anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic strokes is a foremost priority in AF but adherence is challenging for patients and lapses in anticoagulation are common. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a recognized program to enhance self-efficacy and improve adherence, quality of life, and patient-centered health outcomes. Rural patients with AF experience increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes due to geographic and social isolation, poor health care access, and limited health literacy. We propose an innovative, scalable CDSM intervention to improve anticoagulation adherence in rural patients with AF. This single-center parallel group randomized clinical trial employs an embodied conversational agent (ECA) delivered by smartphone. We have used the ECA – a computer character that simulates face-to-face conversation using voice, hand gesture and gaze cues to provide education, monitoring and problem-solving – to improve health behaviors and outcomes in individuals with limited computer and health literacy. Here, guided by a patient advisory committee, we propose to expand our successful 30-day ECA pilot to develop a novel CDSM program for AF. We combine the ECA with the AliveCor Kardia smartphone heart rate and rhythm monitor. We implement a 4-month CDSM curriculum and assess its sustainability at 8 and 12 months. Our trial randomizes 264 patients with AF who are receiving anticoagulation for stroke prevention to (1) the ECA/Kardia intervention, accompanied by provider alerts for prespecified results; or (2) the control, consisting of an AF educational session and a smartphone with a general health application (WebMD). Our trial leverages the clinical infrastructure of the University of Pittsburgh across western Pennsylvania by recruiting at 7 rural clinics that share a common electronic health record. Our aims are: (1) To assess the effect of the ECA/Kardia intervention on anticoagulant adherence, as determined by the medication possession ratio, electronic pill count, and self-report. (2) To identify the effect of the intervention on health care utilization accounting for costs of the intervention, hospitalizations, emergency visits, and AF- related procedures at 1-year follow up. (3) To determine the effect of the intervention on the patient-centered outcomes of quality of life and symptoms, as measured by the AF Effect on QualiTy of life (AFEQT) measure, specific to AF, and the general Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29 Profile at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months. (4) To examine mechanisms for the effect of the intervention by symptom burden, AF classification, health literacy and intervention use. We will additionally follow the cohort through the study period for exploratory analyses of rurality and outcomes associated with AF. Expected Results: In this project we will evaluate a scalable patient-centered intervention to improve anticoagulation adherence, health care utilization and patient-centered outcomes in vulnerable rural individuals with chronic AF. If proven successful, this intervention can be broadly disseminated to improve the care of patients with AF. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is especially morbid for rural individuals, who experience limited health care access, geographic isolation, low health literacy, and cardiovascular disparities. The proposed research is relevant to public health by promoting chronic disease self-management in order to improve anticoagulant adherence for stroke prevention and patient-reported outcomes for

"Integrating Information Resources to Promote Environmental Health Literacy in Appalachian Kentucky PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health disparities in Appalachian Kentucky have been well-documented, with many chronic health conditions disproportionately experienced across the region linked to environmental contributors. Deteriorating infrastructure, inappropriate waste disposal, and risks related to mining, agriculture, and other occupational activities underscore the need for this at-risk population to receive clear, timely, and accessible information about potential environmental health threats to support important decisions about preventive and protective actions. Unfortunately, creating easily understandable resources and tools can prove especially challenging in a region where educational attainment falls well below national averages, with nearly one-quarter of adults over age 25 lacking high school diplomas and only about one-fifth holding an associate's degree or higher. Therefore, improving environmental health literacy (EHL) in the region is critical. EHL uses information and methods from health, social, and environmental sciences to promote understanding of the relationship between environmental exposures and human health. Such understanding can spur individual and/or community actions to minimize unnecessary exposures and mitigate illness related to unavoidable exposures. To this end, it is critical that existing information resources be evaluated, integrated, improved, and made more accessible to help improve EHL and inform environmental health decisions. To address these needs, our multidisciplinary team will deploy stakeholder-engaged research strategies to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1) evaluate existing environmental health-related risk maps currently available from academic, government, and non-profit organizations to determine resource accessibility, navigability, understandability, and perceived utility for Appalachian Kentuckians; 2) conduct needs assessments to identify additional information and appropriate framing required to improve understandability and utility of environmental health-related risk maps for Appalachian Kentuckians; 3) use information gathered in Aims 1 and 2 to enhance maps through the inclusion of critical health-related information in accessible formats, as well as through potential changes to the visualizations themselves to improve understandability; and 4) leverage stakeholder- partnerships developed through the study to disseminate revised maps and additional environmental health resources through community organizations, thereby promoting EHL across the region. PROJECT NARRATIVE Health disparities in Appalachian Kentucky have been well-documented and are driven by many factors, including challenging socioeconomic conditions and low levels of educational attainment, exacerbated by environmental concerns about deteriorating infrastructure, inappropriate waste disposal, and risks related to mining, agriculture, and other occupational activities. This study strives to mitigate these disparities by building regional environmental health literacy through the development, integration, refinement, and provision of timely, understandable, and accessible information about potential environmental health threats and evidence-based preventive and protective actions. A multidisciplinary research team will deploy stakeholder-engaged research strategies to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1) evaluate existing environmental health- related risk maps currently available from academic, government, and non-profit organizations to determine resource accessibility, navigability, understandability, and perceived utility for Appalachian Kentuckians; 2) conduct needs assessments to identify additional information and appropriate framing required to improve understandability and utility of environmental health- related risk maps for Appalachian Kentuckians; 3) use information gathered in Aims 1 and 2 to enhance maps through the inclusion of critical health-related information in accessible formats, as well as through potential changes to the visualizations themselves to improve understandability; and 4) leverage stakeholder-partnerships developed through the study to disseminate revised maps and other environmental health resources through community organizations, thereby promoting EHL across the region.",Integrating Information Resources to Promote Environmental Health Literacy in Appalachian Kentucky,9811734,G08LM013185,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Communities ', ' Community Actions ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Industry ', ' Kentucky ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' waste disposal ', ' Refuse Disposal ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Time ', ' falls ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' tool ', ' Occupational ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' model development ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' health literacy ', ' Population ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' Associate Degree ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,G08,2019,143613,0.06865029093880189
"COMPRENDO: Adaptation and Implementation of a Peer-Navigation Intervention to Improve Research Literacy and Diversity in Pediatric Leukemia Clinical Trials ABSTRACT Childhood cancer is the leading cause of child death by disease past infancy in the US. While survival has improved, mainly due to patient participation in clinical trials, critical racial/ethnic disparities remain. Compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) children, Hispanics have higher incidence of leukemia and poorer survival rates. Although Hispanics will comprise 33% of the U.S. childhood population by 2060, their participation in biomedical research is critically low and, as shown in our prior work, Hispanics are underrepresented in pediatric cancer research. As a result, outcomes data are obtained mostly from NHW. Our preliminary data, and research from others, suggest that adequate informed consent and low research literacy (capacity to understand and act on information to make decisions about research) are barriers to minority participation in clinical trials. Interventions to improve research literacy and clinical trial participation, particularly for Hispanics, are lacking. There is an urgent need to fill this gap in knowledge, as tailored interventions guided by implementation science can improve research literacy and minority participation in clinical trials. The objective of this K08 is to improve research literacy in parents of children with leukemia by adapting (from the patient- navigation model) and implementing “COMPRENDO” (ChildhOod Malignancy Peer REsearch NavigatiOn), a tailored peer-navigation intervention (PNI). Our hypothesis and rationale are that PNIs guided by implementation science, in which trained peers deliver culturally and linguistically concordant education to parents during informed consent, can identify and address barriers to: a) adequate research literacy, and b) equitable clinical trial participation. By increasing minority participation in clinical trials, we can effectively translate discoveries and treatments, and, ultimately, improve equity of survival in diverse populations, which is a top priority for NCI. We propose to implement COMPRENDO to improve parental research literacy in pediatric leukemia clinical trials, using mixed-methods and implementation science (Aim 1). We will compare the effectiveness of COMPRENDO vs. usual care in improving research literacy outcomes among parents of children with leukemia (Aim 2) using a Hybrid Trial Type 1 effectiveness and implementation design. We hypothesize that, compared to usual care, parents randomized to the PNI will show higher comprehension, voluntariness, and accrual and lower mistrust post informed consent discussion and 4 weeks post intervention. This K08 award builds on the formative work of the PI in bioethics and pediatric cancer disparities and maps on to the PI’s training goals in implementation science, intervention adaptation, qualitative methods, and behavioral clinical trial design. This K08 has an important impact: knowledge gained can be generalized to Hispanics across the lifespan and will help to: a) inform clinical care, and b) design a multi-site randomized clinical trial, in which COMPRENDO will be tested in a larger sample of Hispanics with a broader range of cancers in a future R01, enabling the PI’s transition to independence as a successful physician-scientist. NARRATIVE Whereas Hispanic children will comprise 33% of the U.S. population and have higher incidence of certain cancers, their participation in biomedical research is critically low and they have poorer survival rates than non- Hispanic Whites.

"Breast Cancer Screening: Priorities and Attitudes of Diverse Women Under 50 PROJECT SUMMARY Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death and the leading cause of premature mortality for women in the U.S. Women who are racial/ethnic minorities experience an unequal burden of the disease. Breast cancer screening mammography guidelines for women aged 40-49 years are controversial. The potential benefit of avoiding an advanced cancer is often emphasized, while minimizing the frequency of possible harms. Conflicting recommendations for age at initiation and frequency of screening mammography for women aged 40-49 years highlight concerns related to the benefits and harms of screening. These conflicting recommendations leave women confused about when to initiate screening, how often to be screened, what sources to trust, and can undermine informed decision-making about screening mammography. Women from diverse racial/ethnic groups and those with limited health literacy are particularly vulnerable to misunderstanding screening recommendations. Health literacy is the degree to which one has the ability to obtain, process, understand, and use health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions. Those with limited health literacy have difficulty navigating the health care system, making health care decisions, and utilizing cancer screening, all contributing to disparities in cancer care. Health literacy is often a more powerful predictor of health disparities than more well-established predictors such as education and race/ethnicity. Moreover, individuals from traditionally medically underserved communities (e.g., racial/ethnic minority, low socioeconomic status [SES]) are at higher risk for lower health literacy, which can also reduce participation in cancer screening. This project will compare the intersections and differences between how Latina, Black, and non-Latina White women consider the benefits and harms associated with breast cancer screening mammography. The goal of this project is to create decision support tools for Latina, Black, and non-Latina White women with varying levels of health literacy under age 50 considering breast cancer screening mammography.

"OAI, Inc. Worker Training Program: Hazardous Waste Worker Training (HWWT) and Environmental Career Worker Training Program (ECWTP) Consortia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): OAI, a Chicago community-based agency, proposes to implement HWWT and ECWT Consortia. HWWT will target three populations: 1) underfunded rural and volunteer Emergency First Responders 2) Transitional and Temporary Workers and high school dropouts, and 3) Non Union Workers, including Hispanic hazardous waste handlers. Over 5 years, HWWT will train 23,470 students in 19 states and generate 253,660 contact hours. ECWT will assist unemployed African Americans, Hispanics, women, ex-offenders, and veterans who face multiple barriers to employment in Chicago, Dallas and Kansas City by training a total of 420 participants, placing 355 (85%) in jobs and generating 169,440-211,800 instructional contact hours. Significance: Both Consortia target the underserved and address public health disparities, prevention, and protection of workers, EJ residents and their communities from exposure to hazardous substances. ECWT responds to the underrepresentation of disadvantaged residents in the construction/environmental workforce. Leadership and Capacity: OAI has been a WTP grantee since 1995, led by the same Principal Investigator who has 32 years of experience in adult education, workforce development, and grants management. She will be supported by a team of health and safety professionals (IH, CIH) and others with requisite credentials and proven expertise. Innovation: Best practices and innovations of both Consortia include: the implementation of Social Ecological Model (SEM) and Economic Impact Study evaluation plan, integration of Climate Change and Community Resiliency into existing curricula, and Blended Learning. ECWT will continue to refine a unique Try-Outs selection process and demonstrate the Alumni Mentors retention strategy. HWWT will pilot a bilingual Train-the-Trainer model for Vietnamese nail salon workers integrating hazard awareness, SEM, 3Rs (reduction, reuse, and recycling), cultural competence, and community resiliency. Approach: HWWT will deliver direct training instruction via local peer trainers. As a strategy to build local capacity and sustainability, it will customize its Train-the-Trainer model o meet the needs of target populations. ECWT will provide Core Health & Safety Courses; Career Specific Training (Environmental/ Construction, Commercial Truck Driving/Hazmat Endorsement & Warehousing training, Water & Wastewater Operations, and Advanced Construction); Core Soft Skills Training; Supportive Services; and Career Guidance. Environment: For nearly 20 years of operation, OAI has created an environment conducive to collaboration among consortia members. The program has invested in classroom and hands-on training facilities and an array of resources, which can be accessed by consortia trainers and personnel during the five-year grant period.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Worker Training Program (WTP) includes both the Hazardous Waste Worker Training (HWWT) and the Environmental Careers Worker Training (ECWT) Consortia.

"""The Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Communities Worker Health and Safety Training Program"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Dillard University Deep South Center for Environmental Justice hazardous Waste Worker Training Center provides training to hazardous material and waster workers who may perform jobs covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standards and assist employers with complying with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120. The Consortium's goal is unique in that its emphasis is on underserved populations in both its Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program (HWWTP) and its Environmental Careers Worker Training Program (ECWTP).  The proposed HWWTP component has been designed to provide model occupational safety and health training for workers who are or may be engaged in activities related to hazardous waste removal, containment or chemical response. The emphasis however, is on servicing workers of entities where health and safety training is critical to the worker's wellbeing and possibly the safety and health of the public, but due to circumstances beyond the individual worker's control, (s)he is unlikely to receive sufficient training at either the quality or quantity needed to ensure safety and health. Such entities include emergency responders and city workers in small municipalities and or cities where budgeting restraints or working conditions (such as no release time), greatly reduces or eliminates the possibility of training. Volunteer fire departments and small county police forces, city health department employees, port authority workers and mosquito control division employees are examples of workers the Consortium has trained. Additionally, HBCUs with smaller budgets have been shown to receive some of the highest fines for non-compliance with applicable regulations. Small minority and disadvantaged businesses typically lack the capital to participate in high cost compliance training programs. The Consortium has targeted these entities for the proposed HWWT program.  The proposed ECWTP component has been designed to deliver comprehensive worker training to increase the number of underrepresented and disadvantaged minority adults employed in the fields of environmental restoration, hazardous materials and construction. The goals for this program are: (1) to serve underrepresented and disadvantaged adults living near hazardous waste and or contaminated property at risk of exposure to ambient hazards; and also (2) to provide additional pre-employment services that are inclusive of basic skills (i.e. study skills, math, reading, life skils) to increase program retention and completion; and (3) to successfully place trainers in jobs in the environmental restoration and construction fields. The added value of this training is not just that it increases sustainable employment opportunities for residents of beleaguered communities engulfed in situations of poverty and pollution, but that by investing in these particular individuals promotes economic stability, addresses health disparities and advances environmental justice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The HBCU and Communities Consortium Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program is uniquely designed to reach populations for training that have historically, due to poverty and or racism, been disenfranchised and excluded from opportunities existing within society. It also addresses basic inequities in resources for different communities across the country (rural vs urban) and differences in priorities for municipalities and city agencies, with training being first to be cut. Additionally, the Consortium is unique in its make-u in that it includes Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) that by design, serve the selected target population.            ","""The Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Communities Worker Health and Safety Training Program""",9769059,U45ES010664,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Asbestos ', ' Budgets ', ' Capital ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Community Workers ', ' Containment ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disasters ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Goals ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Waste ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Industry ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Mining ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mosquito Control ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Sector ', ' Reading ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Societies ', ' sound ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Occupational Safety and Health Administration ', ' United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Occupational Safety ', ' Businesses ', ' Police Forces ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Hazardous Waste Sites ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' racism ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Heat Stress Disorders ', ' heat-related illness ', ' Heat Stress Syndromes ', ' Heat Stress ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' restraint ', ' Molds ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Hour ', ' restoration ', ' Country ', ' non-compliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' non-compliant ', ' Services ', ' hazard ', ' authority ', ' Employee ', ' Municipalities ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' skills ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' safety education ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' emergency service responder ', ' emergency service personnel ', ' emergency responder ', ' emergency personnel ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' remediation ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' chemical release ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' volunteer ', ' gulf coast ', ' health training ', ' public health relevance ', ' environmental justice ', ' operation ', ' Emergency response ', ' climate impact ', ' Study Skills ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority student ', ' minority communities ', ' first responder ', ' ']",NIEHS,TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY,U45,2019,1231264,0.049632996012657846
"Mechanisms of Health Literacy and Information Accessibility in the Deaf Project Summary Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users are nearly seven times more likely to have inadequate health literacy when compared with their hearing peers. This population is the non-English speaking minority group at greatest risk for miscommunication in health care settings. Health literacy mechanisms for Deaf individuals remain poorly understood, thereby limiting interventions to address health literacy disparities and their impact on health care. It is unclear how differences in attitudes, knowledge, and skills related to health information affect health literacy in Deaf populations and how they may contribute to ongoing health inequities. The two primary objectives of this proposal are: 1) to elucidate the role of information marginalization on health literacy in Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users and 2) to better understand the mechanisms of health literacy in this population so as to identify viable targets for future health literacy intervention development. This proposal is responsive to PAR-10-133's request for studies that assess mechanisms underlying health literacy, including roles of cognition, culture, language fluency, and information-seeking and interpretation ability in the deaf population and, how these may differ from the hearing population. To meet the study objectives, we will employ an explanatory sequential mixed methods design using extensive quantitative data collection procedures, namely, cross-sectional surveys and measures that will identify predictors and moderators of health literacy with 450 Deaf and 450 hearing subjects across three geographically diverse sites. These results will inform the subsequent qualitative assessment that will help explain the quantitative results, and elucidate how and why Deaf individuals access and understand health information. We will incorporate cutting edge technology to assess health information-seeking and interpretation patterns in this population, in addition to using a variety of validated and ASL -accessible instruments to assess health literacy and other constructs related to health literacy. The diverse team, consisting of both leading deaf and hearing researchers, provides a unique insight into how health information is distributed and disseminated visually. This approach has the potential to generate rich data on how to formulate health information and health literacy interventions for individuals with hearing loss. Public Health Relevance (Project Narrative) The public health impact of this study is its ability to understand potential differences in attitudes, knowledge, and skills related to health information between deaf and hearing populations and their degree of impact on health literacy. This research will assist us with improving existing health literacy interventions and tailor future approaches suitable to address the ongoing health inequities seen in the deaf population.",Mechanisms of Health Literacy and Information Accessibility in the Deaf,9762885,R01DC014703,"['Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' health attitude ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' deafness ', ' Knowledge acquisition ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hearing ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' literacy ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Misinformation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' health knowledge ', ' visual learning ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' social ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' hearing impairment ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing defect ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' cognitive ability ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' Information Literacy ', ' Learning Skill ', ' Formulation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' American Sign Language ', ' recruit ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' deaf ', ' profound hearing loss ', ' deafened ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,606904,0.2447143757633736
"Reducing Use of Antibiotics without a Prescription among Outpatients in a Safety Net Healthcare System Non-prescription antibiotic use is an understudied problem, prevalent in some low-income communities. This practice includes obtaining and taking antibiotics without a prescription (e.g., from ethnic stores or flea markets), taking another person's antibiotics, or taking one's own stored antibiotics for an indication other than that for which the antibiotic was originally prescribed. In our survey of low-income primary care patients in a large urban area, respondents from public clinics were more likely than respondents from private clinics to report intention to use antibiotics without a prescription. This survey generated considerable press interest, as the problem has barely been described in the United States, but we did not explore why the non-prescription use was occurring. Non-prescription use increases the risk of development of antibiotic resistance, adverse drug reactions, damage to the microbiome, and other harms. There is a critical need to identify the predictors of non-prescription use that will guide development of effective antimicrobial stewardship interventions in low- income populations, given that these populations are at higher risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections. The overall objectives of the proposed project are to identify the predictors of non-prescription antibiotic use in diverse, predominantly uninsured patients of safety net clinics and lay the foundation for a subsequent intervention. We will use mixed methods and the Kilbourne et al. (2006) conceptual framework for advancing health disparities research to identify the predictors of non-prescription use. In Aim 1 (quantitative phase), we will administer a survey in Spanish and English to assess how patient (e.g., health literacy), health care system (e.g., access to care), and clinical encounter factors (patient-provider communication) are associated with non- prescription antibiotic use in low-income patients. In Aim 2 (qualitative phase), using in-depth interviews, we will explore patient perspectives and experiences with non-prescription use among a racially/ethnically diverse subsample of survey respondents who reported using antibiotics without a prescription. In Aim 3 (development of a communication tool), we will integrate quantitative and qualitative results into a communication tool to be used in the clinics to steer patients toward safer antibiotic use and healthcare options. Our team includes an epidemiologist, an infectious diseases physician, a health disparities researcher, health communications experts, and a medical anthropologist. This multidisciplinary team will work with a Community Advisory Board comprised of patient representatives from participating clinics. Our work will be guided by input from a representative from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and two health literacy consultants, one of whom is bilingual. The proposed research is innovative, because it will provide comprehensive understanding of the predictors of this unsafe use of antibiotics in a low-income population. The research is significant, because it will inform understanding of disparities in use of antibiotics and future development of interventions to reduce harms associated with non-prescription use, such as the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. PROJECT NARRATIVE Taking antibiotics without a health care provider's prescription or guidance puts the person at risk for development of antibiotic-resistant infections, allergic reactions, disturbance of normal gut flora, and other harms. Low-income populations seen in safety net primary care clinics may suffer disproportionately from the practice of taking antibiotics without a prescription. We plan to explore why this occurs, so that we can help people avoid harms from unsafe use of antibiotics and prevent spread of antibiotic resistance.",Reducing Use of Antibiotics without a Prescription among Outpatients in a Safety Net Healthcare System,9796626,R01HS026901,[''],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,500000,0.043814682536026425
"El Trabajo no te Debe Dañar: Reduction of Hazardous Exposures in Small Businesses through a Community Health Worker Intervention PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to reduce negative health outcomes in small businesses that primarily employ high-risk Latino workers by characterizing their exposures to hazardous chemicals and assessing if a community health worker (CHW) intervention is effective at decreasing these exposures. Although preventable by definition, occupational disease and injuries are leading causes of death in the United States, with a disproportionate burden faced by Latinos. Small businesses pose a particular risk. They are more likely to employ low-wage Latino workers, and often use hazardous solvents including volatile organic chemicals that can cause asthma, cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological disease; yet their workers lack access to culturally and linguistically appropriate occupational health and pollution prevention information due to economic, physical, and social barriers. CHW-led interventions and outreach in Latino communities have documented increased access to health care and health education and reduced workplace exposures among farmworkers. CHWs are an innovative method to bridge the gap between these small business communities and other stakeholders. The proposed project will capitalize on established partnerships between the University of Arizona, the Sonora Environmental Research Institute, Inc. and the El Rio Community Health Center. A community-engaged research framework will be used to complete the following specific aims: 1) quantify and identify exposures to hazardous chemicals in the two high risk small business sectors common in our target area (i.e., auto repair shops and beauty salons); 2) work collaboratively with business owners, trade groups, workers and CHWs to design an industrial hygiene – enhanced CHW intervention tailored for each small business sector; and 3) conduct a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the CHW intervention at reducing workplace exposures to volatile organic compounds and assess which factors led to successful utilization of exposure control strategies in both male and female-dominated businesses. Businesses will be randomized to either an intervention or delayed intervention group, both of which will receive incentives to participate including worksite health screenings. CHWs will work closely with business owners and employees to select and implement exposure-strategies appropriate for their worksite using a menu of complementary strategies of varying complexity and cost. This innovative project has the potential to directly reduce occupational health disparities through a CHW intervention that moves beyond providing occupational health education. The intervention will overcome current barriers by helping marginalized Latino workers and small business owners who may have limited education, literacy, and computer skills to understand the hazards associated with their work, and will empower them to have greater control over their occupational exposures, with the ultimate goal of preventing occupational disease and reducing health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Occupational exposures contribute to minority health disparities. This study will formally evaluate if a community health worker intervention can effectively reduce workplace exposures in marginalized small businesses to hazardous chemicals. Through face-to-face encounters, this study will increase the capacity of workers with limited education, literacy, and computer skills to understand workplace hazards and effective control options to reduce exposures and prevent occupational disease.",El Trabajo no te Debe Dañar: Reduction of Hazardous Exposures in Small Businesses through a Community Health Worker Intervention,9605790,R01ES028250,"['Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incentives ', ' Industry ', ' Labor Unions ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' literacy ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' occupational disorder ', ' occupational disease/disorder ', ' Occupational Diseases ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' Organic Chemicals ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' Solvents ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Industrial Hygiene ', ' Industrial Health ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Businesses ', ' Information Protection ', ' Latino ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Individual ', ' occupational health/safety ', ' Exposure to ', ' farm worker ', ' farmworker ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Occupational ', ' empowered ', ' hazard ', ' Employee ', ' skills ', ' research study ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' minority health ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' Pollution Prevention ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Occupational injury ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Arizona ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Beauty ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Community Workers ', ' Computers ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Government Programs ', ' Hazardous Chemicals ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,585863,0.02788269235191267
"Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) is a highly productive research network that is essential to advancing the science and practice of pediatric critical care medicine. The overall aim of this renewal application is for Wayne State University (WSU), under the leadership of Kathleen Meert, MD, to continue as a clinical site in the CPCCRN. Dr. Meert, PI for the CPCCRN at WSU for the past 10 years, is a pediatric intensivist with a wealth of clinical and translational research experienc and an established track record of scientific publications for the CPCCRN. Additionally, Dr. Meert has demonstrated research expertise in behavioral medicine and communication science. Strengths of WSU as a clinical site include the Children s Hospital of Michigan (CHM), a free-standing, tertiary care, academic children s hospital offering the full spectrum of pediatric and surgical subspecialty services. The PICU at CHM is a 38-bed multidisciplinary unit that cares for >1500 patients/year with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Over 85% of PICU patients have follow-up within the institution. CHM is an American College of Surgeons verified Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center and an American Burn Association verified Burn Center. Additional strengths of WSU include its vast experience with federally-funded multicenter research networks such as the Neonatal Network, Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Intervention, Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials Network, Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network, and the Children s Oncology Group. The concept proposal included in this application builds on prior CPCCRN research, led by Dr. Meert, demonstrating many challenges to achieving high quality parent-clinician communication in PICUs. High quality communication is especially important for parents with low health literacy, a key contributing factor to child health disparities. Patient- and family-centered communication (PFCC) may improve the quality of communication but depends, in part, on parents  active participation (e.g., question asking) during clinical interactions. The objective of the concept proposal is to develop a novel communication intervention, the Question Prompt Toolkit; and determine the extent to which the intervention can enhance PFCC in PICUs, and thus improve child and family outcomes. The central hypothesis is that use of the Question Prompt Toolkit will increase parents  active participation in clinical interactions, knowledge, self-efficacy and trust, reduce parent's  anxiety, and ultimately contribute to better health-related quality of life for the child and reduced family burden, especially for families with low health literacy. The hypothesis will be tested in multicenter research that pursues 2 specific aims: (1) Develop the Question Prompt Toolkit for use among parents of critically-ill children; and (2) Determine the extent to which the Question Prompt Toolkit can enhance the use of PFCC in PICUs and improve child and family outcomes. The proposal is significant because it will contribute a new communication intervention that can be applied in PICU practice to address parents'  communication needs and improve health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The concept proposal is relevant to public health because achieving high quality healthcare communication can help to improve the problem of low health literacy. Low health literacy among parents is a key contributor to racial and ethnic disparities i child health and healthcare. Thus, the concept proposal is relevant to the NIH s mission because eliminating health disparities is a major goal of Healthy People 2020.",Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research

"Training At-Risk Industrial, Telecommunication and Immigrant Workers on How to Protect Themselves from Exposure to Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Products ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Steelworkers Charitable and Educational Organization (SCEO), the non-profit (501c3) arm of the United Steelworkers (USW), is applying for HWWTP, HDPTP and ECWTP funds to support a training partnership linking two of the largest U.S.-based industrial unions with rapidly expanding immigrant worker centers. The Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC), the SCEO's training entity, brings together the USW, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the Labor Institute (LI), and the National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON) and Make the Road New York (MRNY). In the next five years through these three submissions, the TMC will provide more than 65,000 workers and community residents with over 950,000 hours of training to help prevent toxic releases, fires, explosions, injuries, sickness and death. Through our proposed HWWTP five-year program, we will conduct 2,745 courses that will reach 55,950 workers, managers and community residents with 633,700 hours of training. To prevent fatalities, injuries, illnesses and releases of hazardous substances, we will focus WTP training and mentoring on H&S committee members and other activists who are in a position to help achieve concrete and lasting institutional changes at hundreds of U.S. worksites and communities. For our worker center partners, the focus will be on building a robust and widely dispersed H&S training capacity (in English and Spanish) for immigrant day-laborers and temporary workers who face a myriad of hazards on their ever-shifting worksites. The HDPTP program will establish a multi-lingual team of trainers (Specialized Emergency Response Trainers - SERTs) who are prepared to go anywhere at any time to provide training to emergency response and clean-up workers and community members engaged in massive man-made or weather-related disasters. To achieve this goal will dramatically increase the supply of Spanish language OSHA-certified Master Trainers who can conduct the full-range of HWWTP-related OSHA courses. We also will establish a SERTs infectious diseases working group to provide training expertise on donning and doffing high-level protective clothing and the proper use of related equipment to protect health care and hazardous waste workers. Our HDPTP program will offer 400 classes that will provide 9,050 at-risk workers and community residents with 119,000 contact hours. In the ECWTP program we will support and enhance workforce development programs conducted by MRNY in Queens and Brooklyn, NY, and the A. Philip Randolph Institute (APRI) in Pittsburgh, PA to place unemployed and underemployed workers in decent-paying occupations in construction, environmental cleanup and other green jobs. After providing 15 weeks of training for up to 450 workers over the term of the award, we will place at least 75 percent of these participants in good green jobs. Target Populations: The TMC has access to over 1.2 million USW/CWA workers and managers at facilities located in each U.S. state as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. They work in oil, chemical manufacturing, nuclear energy, pharmaceuticals, pulp, paper, automobile parts, appliance manufacturing, cement, metal manufacturing, construction, rubber, plastics, shipbuilding, light manufacturing, telecommunications, transportation, electrical manufacturing and health care. Approximately 850,000 of these workers are potentially exposed to hazardous substances covered by OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910, EPA 40 CFR 311, and DOT 49 CFR 171-177. The day laborers and temporary workers we will reach are employed in virtually every kind of clean-up activity, especially during emergencies, in addition to construction, car washes, cleaning, home care, warehousing and distribution. MRNY has over 16,000 members at its centers in New York in Bushwick, Jackson Heights, Port Richmond, Midland Beach, and Brentwood, Long Island. It is opening new centers in NJ, CT and PA. NDLON is a network of 45 day-laborer organizations in fifteen states and it estimates that approximately 5,000 workers pass through its centers nationwide each day.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 300 worker-trainers from the United Steelworkers (USW), the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), and Make the Road New York (MRNY) will provide hazardous waste training to front-line workers, communities and other-stakeholders in order to protect the worker health and safety, the public's health, and the environment. The workers we represent, who produce, dispose of, and transport billions of pounds of hazardous substances and wastes, will receive HAZWOPER and related OSHA training. Our combined HWWTP, HDPTP and ECWTP proposed five-year programs will conduct over 3,300 classes for 65,000 workers and residents, providing more than 900,000 hours of training.            ","Training At-Risk Industrial, Telecommunication and Immigrant Workers on How to Protect Themselves from Exposure to Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Products",9755427,U45ES006175,"['Academy ', ' Americas ', ' Automobiles ', ' Award ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carbon ', ' Chemistry ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' pulp ', ' Dental Pulp ', ' Disasters ', ' Dust ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Explosion ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Hazardous Chemicals ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Waste ', ' Health ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mentors ', ' Metals ', ' New York ', ' Atomic Energy ', ' Nuclear Energy ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Oils ', ' Paper ', ' Plastics ', ' toxic compound ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Poison ', ' Program Development ', ' Protective Clothing ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Risk ', ' natural Rubber ', ' Latex Rubber ', ' Rubber ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' statistics ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telecommunications ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' Transportation ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Virgin Islands ', ' United States Virgin Islands ', ' Waste Products ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' underemployed ', ' Underemployment ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' patient home care ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' news ', ' Multilingualism ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Country ', ' Occupational ', ' meetings ', ' hazard ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' nanotechnological ', ' nanotech ', ' nano-technological ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' Committee Members ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' virtual ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' resilience ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' community organizations ', ' Long Island ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' Toxics Release Inventory ', ' arm ', ' Emergency response ', ' climate impact ', ' Workforce Development ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIEHS,STEELWORKER CHARITABLE/EDUCATIONAL ORG,U45,2019,2172545,0.06766243852285567
"Enhancing Health Literacy in Surgery (EHLIS) to Eliminate Surgical Disparities for African-Americans with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) PROJECT SUMMARY Rationale: In the United States, over 3.1 million people suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which includes Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Most patients will require major surgery in their lifetime. As the incidence of IBD rises in racial/ethnic minority populations, surgical disparities are emerging with significantly worse outcomes for African-Americans compared to whites. Recent data has suggested a potential role of health literacy in determining surgical outcomes (and disparities), but, to our knowledge, no literacy-based interventions in surgery exist. This project aims to address surgical disparities through the development of a health literate surgical care program to eliminate disparities for African-Americans with IBD. These project goals would support the core missions of the NIHMD and Healthy People 2020 in achieving health equity for all patients. Objectives: My long-term career objective is to become an independent researcher focused on identifying, understanding and eliminating surgical disparities. Through this career development award, my remaining gaps in knowledge and skills will be filled through a personalized three-year training program that will include didactics (for an MSPH), mini-sabbaticals and mentorship by an experienced mentor team. These plans will support my research goals: (i) to identify factors that impact health literacy in current surgical care programs and (ii) to develop a health literate and culturally-competent surgical care program through stakeholder engagement. Design and Methods: Our study will use a mixed-method formative research approach with significant stakeholder engagement. Guided by the Health Literacy and Outcomes Framework, we will first use qualitative methods (key informant interviews/focus groups) to identify gaps in current surgical care that may impact an African-American IBD patient’s capacity to obtain, process and understand surgical information (Specific Aim 1a). We will then develop stakeholder-centered quantitative assessments to confirm the qualitative findings (Specific Aim 1b). We will finally use an iterative multidimensional stakeholder engagement process to design a health literate surgical care program (“Enhancing Health Literacy in Surgery” or EHLIS) (Specific Aim 2). We will conduct this study at a high-volume, tertiary-care IBD center that serves a high-proportion of African-Americans with IBD. The results of this study will provide the data for an R21 submission to examine EHLIS feasibility, which, in turn, will inform a larger randomized trial (R01/PCORI). Significance: In conjunction with my career development/training plans, this project will inform the development of a health literate intervention focused on improving surgical outcomes and eliminating disparities in African- American IBD patients undergoing major surgery. Lessons learned could have much broader implications in other surgical populations as surgical disparities exist in all disciplines and innovative interventions are needed. RELEVANCE African-Americans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often faced with major surgery and represent a growing population at high-risk for surgical disparities. The proposed research focuses on eliminating these disparities by developing a surgical care program crafted with health literacy-based interventions. Successful development of a health literate surgical care program has the potential to positively impact the African-American IBD population and may offer a patient-centered approach to addressing surgical disparities in other vulnerable surgical populations.",Enhancing Health Literacy in Surgery (EHLIS) to Eliminate Surgical Disparities for African-Americans with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD),9720436,K23MD013903,"['Academy ', ' Affect ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Complication ', ' regional enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', "" Crohn's disorder "", "" Crohn's "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fistula ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Interview ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' literacy ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Obstruction ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' surgical construction of a stoma ', ' Ostomy ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Visual Aide ', ' Visual Aid ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' Malnutrition ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' literate ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' Readability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' tertiary care ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' health equity ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' sabbatical ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' readmission rates ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K23,2019,152329,0.15227579774315236
"Kids SIPsmartER: A multi-level behavioral and health literacy intervention to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages among Appalachian middle-school students Project Summary: The intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB, e.g., soda/pop, sweet tea, sports and energy drinks, fruit drinks) is disproportionately high in Appalachia, including among adolescents whose intake is more than double the national average and more than four times the recommended daily amount. There are strong and consistent scientific data and systematic reviews documenting relationships among high SSB consumption and numerous chronic health conditions such obesity, some types of obesity-related cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dental erosion and decay. Reaching adolescents with behaviorally- focused health programs where they spend the majority of their time, at school, shows promise. However, engaging caregivers who serve as their child’s most influential role model as well as the gatekeeper for the home environment may be equally as important in changing adolescents’ SSB behaviors. Finally, there is a great need to understand how to support schools and teachers to deliver and maintain evidence-based health education programs, especially among rural schools. Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is to work in partnership with Appalachian middle schools to implement and evaluate Kids SIPsmartER. Kids SIPsmartER is a 6-month, school-based, behavior and health literacy curriculum aimed at improving SSB behaviors among middle school students. The program also integrates a two-way short service message (SMS) strategy to engage caregivers in SSB role modeling and supporting home SSB environment changes. Kids SIPsmartER is grounded by the Theory of Planned Behavior as well as health literacy, media literacy, numeracy, and public health literacy concepts. In our proposed cluster-randomized controlled trial, we target 12 middle schools in medically underserved Appalachian counties in southwest Virginia. Our study is guided by the RE-AIM (reach, adoption, effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance) framework and is a type 1 hybrid design. The primary aim is to assess changes in SSB behaviors at 7-months among 7th grade students at schools receiving Kids SIPsmartER, as compared to control schools. We will also evaluate changes in secondary student outcomes (e.g., BMI, quality of life, theory-related variables), changes in caregiver outcomes (e.g., SSB behaviors, home SSB environment), and 19-month maintenance of outcomes. The reach and representativeness of Kids SIPsmartER will be assessed. Furthermore, we will use a mixed-methods approach with interviews, surveys, observation, and process evaluation strategies to determine the degree to which teachers implement Kids SIPsmartER as intended and the potential for institutionalization within the schools. The long-term goal of this health promotion and prevention line of research is to establish an effective, scalable, and sustainable multi-level strategy to improve SSB behaviors and reduce SSB-related health inequities and chronic conditions (e.g. obesity, cancer, type II diabetes, heart disease, dental caries) in rural Appalachia. Project Narrative: Excessive sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) consumption among Appalachian adolescents is well-established and is associated with numerous chronic health conditions (e.g., obesity, some cancers, type II diabetes, heart disease, dental caries). Collaborating with local Appalachian school systems to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-level intervention strategies to reduce SSB consumption among middle- school students and their caregivers has important public health implications. The public health relevance of this prevention and disparities focused research is further signified by our efforts to promote and determine the capacity of partnering school districts to implement and sustain the multi-level SSB reduction intervention.",Kids SIPsmartER: A multi-level behavioral and health literacy intervention to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages among Appalachian middle-school

"Using Community-Engaged Methods to Design a Tool to Promote Informed Breast Cancer Screening Decisions for Low Literacy Women PROJECT SUMMARY Low health literacy (LHL) is increasingly recognized as an important driver of cancer disparities, and given that one in five Americans lack the necessary literacy skills to function adequately in our health care system, this is a burgeoning public health crisis. Adults with LHL are less likely to use preventive services, less likely to undergo cancer screening, and have higher mortality. Mammography screening decisions, which increasingly call for shared-decision making between patient and physician, is an exemplar of where communication challenges are most likely to affect outcomes for LHL populations. Informed decisions for breast cancer screening that account for individual risk of developing breast cancer and patient preferences are recommended by professional guidelines for women aged 40-54 for whom the harms of screening can exceed the benefits. While mammography screening is estimated to reduce breast cancer mortality by 15% for women in their 40s, screening in younger women has high rates of false positives (40-60% over ten years) and substantial estimates of over-diagnosis (15-48% of those screened). Data consistently show that communication about mammography screening inadequately prepares women for these outcomes and there are widespread misperceptions about mammography and its utility among women making screening decisions. While literacy is a known barrier to receiving mammography, there are currently no decision tools to help women with LHL with their decision-making. Therefore, the goal of this training and research program is to develop the necessary knowledge and skills to create and test a novel decision aid to increase informed breast cancer screening decisions for women ages 40-54 with LHL. Training will cover four essential domains: 1) Community-Engaged Research Methods; 2) Tools to Improve Informed Decision-Making; 3) Low Literacy Populations; and 4) Patient-Centered Outcome Assessment. The knowledge gained through didactic training and one-on-one mentoring will support three proposed Research Aims. First, I will engage multiple stakeholders, including women with LHL (n=25) and their clinicians (n=20), in qualitative interviews to understand and characterize their decisional preferences and identify outcomes that matter most. Second, I will construct a multi-media decision aid appropriate for use with women with LHL ages 40-54. An expert panel (n=10) will assist in evaluating the acceptability of evidence based content for inclusion, and women with LHL will provide input on tool acceptability and pilot outcomes via cognitive interviews and a survey (n=30). Third, I aim to assess the impact of the decision aid on decision-making outcomes (decisional conflict, knowledge, shared decision-making) and screening intentions through a pilot pre-test/post-test study among 50 women and their primary care providers. This work will launch my career as an independent investigator trained to design and disseminate patient-centered decision supports that help to optimize the delivery of cancer screening services for those with LHL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Literacy is a critical aspect of disparities research, and is particularly salient when aiming to support and improve decision-making in health care. This research will develop and test a multi-media decision aid for breast cancer screening with an explicit focus on the needs of women with low health literacy using community engaged methods, thus enhancing its translational potential. It will provide novel data on individual experiences with informed decision-making and the effects of a decision aid on patient-centered outcomes among a low health literacy population.",Using Community-Engaged Methods to Design a Tool to Promote Informed Breast Cancer Screening Decisions for Low Literacy Women,9746671,K07CA221899,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' literacy ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Suggestion ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Decision Aid ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Address ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Data ', ' Low Literacy Population ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' investigator training ', ' informant ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' shared decision making ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammography screening ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Information Literacy ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' screening disparities ', ' cognitive interview ', ' screening guidelines ', ' screening recommendations ', ' recommended screening ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,K07,2019,129151,-0.027143104511673594

"Health Literacy Assessment and Intervention to Reduce Disparities: FLIGHT/VIDAS II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is a critically important skill that helps people to become active participants in their health care. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy showed that more than 75 million Americans had basic health literacy skills, indicating that as many as 1 in 4 Americans can have difficulty understanding information about their healthcare. Persons in racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have even lower levels of health literacy. Twenty-four percent of blacks (9.5 million persons) and 41% of Hispanics (21 million persons) have below basic levels of health literacy. These persons have lower levels of health literacy and compelling evidence, including our own findings (see below), link race and ethnicity to disparities in health via health literacy. Members of minority groups and older adults are more frequently affected by chronic diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, asthma, hepatitis C, HIV infection, mental health disorders and many others. The twin burdens of chronic disease and low levels of health literacy thus fall disproportionately on those most in need - members of minorities and older adults, all of whom likely to experience one or more chronic conditions while often not having the health literacy skills to help them cope. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a logical target for a general health literacy intervention. In an approach that cuts across specific diseases. CDSM targets problems and skills needed to cope with issues such as fatigue, pain, stress, depression, sleep disturbance and treatment adherence. Studies show that in- person CDSM classes improve patients' functioning and reduce healthcare utilization, but their availability is limited due to the lack of qualified personnel and cost. Similarly, while interventions have been developed to improve health literacy, they are difficult to scale to levels needed to meet the challenge of low health literacy (for more than 40 million persons) due to their cost. Effective interventions with the potential for wider dissemination at reasonable costs are urgently needed. In a previous study, we showed that a computer-delivered tailored information intervention targeting health literacy that can deployed either as an information kiosk in a clinical office or n the Internet could be cost- effective in improving patients' health literacy and adherence. It is nt clear, however, whether the same sort of computer-delivered, multimedia and interactive approach will be effective in improving CDSM skills in persons with low baseline levels of health literacy, and if it is, whether its effects will extend beyond health literacy to general health, slf-efficacy, activation, and treatment adherence. In this follow-up study we will evaluate this possibility by creating a personally relevant computer-delivered intervention targeting CDSM and health literacy among African-Americans, Hispanics, and white non-Hispanics: PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving patient health literacy through their chronic disease management skills and knowledge may be an effective strategy reducing health disparities. In this project we will build on our work in health literacy and computer-delivered interventions to create a new intervention to reduce health disparities by improving health literacy and chronic disease management among African-American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic whites.",Health Literacy Assessment and Intervention to Reduce Disparities: FLIGHT/VIDAS II,9800153,R01MD010368,"['Adult ', '

"Evaluating employment quality as a social determinant of health in a changing economy Project Summary This proposal address a major gap in our understanding of health disparities by considering the effects of employment conditions on population health. This research is particularly important as economic, social, technical, and political drivers are fundamentally transforming the nature and organization of work—especially the shift away from job security toward more “flexible” and competitive employment practices. In particular, there has been a decline in the so-called Standard Employment Relationship (SER; i.e., permanent, full-time, regularly-scheduled work, with secure wages and benefits) and concurrent rise in non-standard employment arrangements. Modifications in employment structures affect a significant portion of the U.S. workforce, but disproportionately impact women, people of color, immigrants, younger workers, and lower-skilled and lower- educated workers. Most studies of the relationship between work and health have focused on physical, chemical, and psychosocial exposures; however, the terms and conditions of the employee-employer relationship, identified as employment quality (EQ) characteristics, are increasingly being recognized as important work-related determinants of health. Prior health research has struggled with the conceptualization and measurement of EQ. While previous U.S. studies have mostly used single-dimensional approaches (e.g., non-permanent contracts), there is an emerging consensus that EQ should be conceived of as a multidimensional construct. However, studies using multidimensional constructs of EQ have been restricted to Europe and Canada, despite the fact that generalizability of European research to the U.S. context is limited due to large differences between the respective labor markets and social safety nets. To advance the conceptualization and measurement of EQ in the U.S., we propose to first develop a multidimensional construct of EQ using latent class analysis (LCA). The LCA procedure will assign workers into classes based on a set of objective indicators of employment arrangements. To operationalize EQ, we will leverage two representative population surveys containing rich information on a broad range of employment conditions of U.S. workers: the General Social Survey and the American Working Conditions Survey. We will then test whether EQ is associated with workers’ health and well-being, as well as important individual- and organizational-level characteristics. We will also examine if the distribution of EQ has changed between 2002 and 2014, and compare our results to prior European LCA studies that used similar EQ indicators. A particular focus of this research is to examine the potential mechanisms by which EQ may contribute to population health disparities, including by 1) characterizing the distribution of EQ across different sociodemographic groups, and 2) testing whether there is an interaction with attributes of EQ that produce differential health effects in these groups. This work is an essential step to further elucidating the role of employment in producing health and health disparities in complex modern economies. Project Narrative The dramatic changes in the organization of work over the last several decades have not been adequately examined from a public health perspective. This study will use advanced theoretical and analytic approaches to conceptualize a multidimensional construct of employment quality, defined as the terms and conditions of the employer-employee relationship that may affect workers’ health, and examine its distribution across sociodemographic groups and association with workers’ health. Given the strong connection between employment and health, improving precarious employment conditions may enhance the health of millions of Americans, and particularly benefit populations that are disproportionately impacted by low quality employment.",Evaluating employment quality as a social determinant of health in a changing economy,9811795,F31MD013357,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Canada ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Color ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Europe ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Work Satisfaction ', ' Job Satisfaction ', ' Labor Unions ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Modernization ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Schedule ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Immigrant ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Nature ', ' Consensus ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Employee ', ' Structure ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Fissural ', ' Security ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' demographics ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Secure ', ' urban residence ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2019,40880,0.04504725941146519
"""The Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Communities Worker Health and Safety Training Program"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Dillard University Deep South Center for Environmental Justice hazardous Waste Worker Training Center provides training to hazardous material and waster workers who may perform jobs covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standards and assist employers with complying with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120. The Consortium's goal is unique in that its emphasis is on underserved populations in both its Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program (HWWTP) and its Environmental Careers Worker Training Program (ECWTP).  The proposed HWWTP component has been designed to provide model occupational safety and health training for workers who are or may be engaged in activities related to hazardous waste removal, containment or chemical response. The emphasis however, is on servicing workers of entities where health and safety training is critical to the worker's wellbeing and possibly the safety and health of the public, but due to circumstances beyond the individual worker's control, (s)he is unlikely to receive sufficient training at either the quality or quantity needed to ensure safety and health. Such entities include emergency responders and city workers in small municipalities and or cities where budgeting restraints or working conditions (such as no release time), greatly reduces or eliminates the possibility of training. Volunteer fire departments and small county police forces, city health department employees, port authority workers and mosquito control division employees are examples of workers the Consortium has trained. Additionally, HBCUs with smaller budgets have been shown to receive some of the highest fines for non-compliance with applicable regulations. Small minority and disadvantaged businesses typically lack the capital to participate in high cost compliance training programs. The Consortium has targeted these entities for the proposed HWWT program.  The proposed ECWTP component has been designed to deliver comprehensive worker training to increase the number of underrepresented and disadvantaged minority adults employed in the fields of environmental restoration, hazardous materials and construction. The goals for this program are: (1) to serve underrepresented and disadvantaged adults living near hazardous waste and or contaminated property at risk of exposure to ambient hazards; and also (2) to provide additional pre-employment services that are inclusive of basic skills (i.e. study skills, math, reading, life skils) to increase program retention and completion; and (3) to successfully place trainers in jobs in the environmental restoration and construction fields. The added value of this training is not just that it increases sustainable employment opportunities for residents of beleaguered communities engulfed in situations of poverty and pollution, but that by investing in these particular individuals promotes economic stability, addresses health disparities and advances environmental justice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The HBCU and Communities Consortium Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program is uniquely designed to reach populations for training that have historically, due to poverty and or racism, been disenfranchised and excluded from opportunities existing within society. It also addresses basic inequities in resources for different communities across the country (rural vs urban) and differences in priorities for municipalities and city agencies, with training being first to be cut. Additionally, the Consortium is unique in its make-u in that it includes Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) that by design, serve the selected target population.","""The Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Communities Worker Health and Safety Training Program""",10001095,U45ES010664,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Asbestos ', ' Budgets ', ' Capital ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Community Workers ', ' Containment ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disasters ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Goals ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Waste ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Industry ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Mining ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mosquito Control ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Sector ', ' Reading ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Societies ', ' sound ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Occupational Safety and Health Administration ', ' United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Occupational Safety ', ' Businesses ', ' Police Forces ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Hazardous Waste Sites ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' racism ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Heat Stress Disorders ', ' heat-related illness ', ' Heat Stress Syndromes ', ' Heat Stress ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' restraint ', ' Molds ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Hour ', ' restoration ', ' Country ', ' non-compliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' non-compliant ', ' Services ', ' hazard ', ' authority ', ' Employee ', ' Municipalities ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' skills ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' safety education ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' emergency service responder ', ' emergency service personnel ', ' emergency responder ', ' emergency personnel ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' remediation ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' chemical release ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' volunteer ', ' gulf coast ', ' health training ', ' public health relevance ', ' environmental justice ', ' operation ', ' Emergency response ', ' climate impact ', ' Study Skills ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority student ', ' minority communities ', ' first responder ', ' ']",NIEHS,TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY,U45,2019,138521,0.049632996012657846
"Developing an implementation strategy for post-concussion communication with low health literacy parents in the emergency department PROJECT SUMMARY Parents can play an important role in evidence-based concussion management by (1) monitoring their child's activity and level of stimulation, (2) communicating with school personnel about potential need for short-term academic accommodations, and (3) ensuring their child does not return to contact or collision sport prematurely and risk greater injury. However, not all parents follow these evidence-based guidelines, in part due to health literacy deficits, and further compounded by the poor fit and inconsistent implementation of educational materials. The initial medical encounter following a concussion provides an important opportunity for evidence-based knowledge translation to parents. Families at risk of low health literacy most often seek initial post-concussion care in emergency departments (ED) and often do not follow-up with a primary care provider or concussion specialist. Knowledge translation to parents in the ED is often inconsistent in terms of content and delivery, and existing approaches often do not meet the needs of families with low health literacy. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Re-Engineered Discharge (RED) Toolkit provides an evidence-based approach to supporting the implementation of parent education that has not as yet been adapted for use post-concussion in the ED setting. Aim 1: Develop toolkit to support evidence-based parent education post-concussion in the ED. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will adapt the AHRQ RED Toolkit to facilitate post-concussion parent education in the ED. The evidence-based parent education to be shared will be the CDC Acute Concussion Care Plan, adapted to meet learning needs of parents with low health literacy and limited English proficiency. We will use parent and provider interviews to iteratively develop the implementation toolkit (provider training, checklists, EHR support, downloadable parent materials) in consultation with an advisory board comprised of providers and parents. Aim 2: Conduct a hybrid implementation-effectiveness evaluation of the educational intervention. Guided by the RE-AIM framework, our primary outcomes will be the reach, acceptability, and implementation of the post-concussion education intervention. We will also explore whether successful implementation is associated with (1) improved parent knowledge and self-efficacy related to helping their child adhere to CDC guidelines for returning to daily activities, school and sports, and (2) decreased disparity in knowledge and self- efficacy between high and low health literacy parents. Achieving these aims will result in a scalable approach to the implementation of the CDC's ACE Care Plan in the pediatric ED post-concussion. If parents are better able to follow evidence-based guidelines for concussion, they will better advocate and care for their children, and this should improve outcomes for all youth. More broadly, achieving these aims will provide a model for engaging low health literacy parents in adapting evidence-based educational practices for implementation in ED settings. NARRATIVE Inconsistent implementation of concussion education for parents in Emergency Department settings contributes to inequities in post-concussion outcomes for youth. This project seeks to develop an implementation toolkit for evidence-based parent concussion education in the Emergency Department based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Re-Engineered Discharge (RED) Toolkit.

"Hablame Bebe: Improving health information access for low-income Hispanic children's early language environments PROJECT SUMMARY  Hispanic infants whose families live in poverty are at a significantly elevated risk of poorer cognitive development and academic achievement. Research shows that this is explained in part by their early language environment: children from lower socioeconomic status (SES) homes often experience less high-quality language input than children from higher SES homes, which in turn may lead to delays or gaps in later language skills. Unfortunately, these circumstances can be worse for Hispanic children whose immigrant caregivers believe that they should switch from Spanish to English as a result of assimilation pressure or misinformed advice. Additionally, Hispanics parents are more than twice as likely to have low health literacy and significantly less likely to attend well-child care check-ups.  In response to this disparity, our interdisciplinary team created Háblame Bebé, the first mobile phone application that reduces the word gap and promotes Spanish-English bilingualism for low-income Hispanic children. In 2017, Háblame Bebé was selected as the winner of the U.S. HRSA Bridging the Word Gap Challenge. For this Challenge, we developed two prototypes and tested them with 32 low-income Hispanic families. In this study, we learned that although our app was effective in improving overall outcomes for children, parents who had experienced linguistic racism were not as likely to give “Language Nutrition” to their babies in their native Spanish. Only after we created a sociolinguistic pride component in the app did it lead to caregivers providing significantly more “Language Nutrition” to their children.  Based on our team’s research on the impact of Háblame Bebé, we need to make additions to the app in order to maximize outreach and effectiveness for low-income, low-literacy Hispanic caregivers. The proposed project seeks to serve this high-risk group by developing, disseminating, and evaluating health information pertaining to early developmental milestones and language environments for low- income Hispanic families. We have partnered with a health sciences librarian as well as the Miami-Dade County Public Library System, and together, will do this by: (Aim 1) improving the deliverability, usability, and understandability of early child development information to low-SES Hispanic families; (Aim 2) developing additional educational content targeting low health literacy and cultural representation; and (Aim 3) assessing the effectiveness of the Háblame Bebé phone app using quantitative and qualitative analyses.  Our goal is to design the most impactful evidence-based app intervention to eliminate the word gap in low-income Hispanic children in the United States and to deliver better, culturally relevant, and usable health information to low-income Hispanic families to reduce disparities in their children. The new content developed will assist in making the Háblame Bebé phone app ready for clinical trial testing upon conclusion of the project. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop, disseminate, and evaluate health information pertaining to early developmental milestones and language environments for low-income Hispanic children via the parent coaching phone app, Háblame Bebé, winner of the HRSA Bridging the Word Gap Challenge. Háblame Bebé teaches low-income Hispanic caregivers how to enhance their “Language Nutrition,” thereby increasing Spanish-English bilingualism in their children, which has shown to positively impact children’s educational success and long-term health outcomes. We will partner with library specialists to improve the efficacy of the app for low-income, low- health literacy Hispanic parents by 1) improving the deliverability, usability, and understandability of early child development information to low-SES Hispanic families; 2) creating new educational content that targets low health literacy and cultural representation; and 3) assessing the effectiveness and acceptance of the app via quantitative and qualitative analyses.",Hablame Bebe: Improving health information access for low-income Hispanic children's early language environments,9811751,G08LM013183,"['Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Health Science Library ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' literacy ', ' nutrition ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' pressure ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' County ', ' Librarians ', ' Walking ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Assimilations ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' racism ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' cooking ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' sociolinguistics ', ' success ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' Toddler ', ' outreach ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Early identification ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' kindergarten ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' language processing ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' Learning Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Education Module ', ' cognitive development ', ' curriculum development ', ' social media ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' non-Native ', ' nonnative ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' early life adversity ', ' early childhood adversity ', ' early adversity ', ' ']",NLM,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,G08,2019,148897,0.06051455191329971
"Disparities in HIV/AIDS: Examining Retention in Care and Health Literacy (ENRICH) PROJECT SUMMARY  African Americans (AA) account for 40% of the nearly 1.2 million persons living with HIV/AIDS in the United States. Of the nearly 40,000 new annual HIV diagnoses, 45% occur among AAs. AAs also have the highest rates of AIDS diagnoses and are more likely to die from HIV/AIDS than any other racial/ethnic group. A major contributor to the morbidity and mortality of HIV/AIDS among AAs is poor retention in HIV/AIDS care. Of AAs who are diagnosed and linked to care, only 34% attend regularly scheduled HIV/AIDS medical appointments, the lowest retention in care among racial/ethnic groups. Poor retention in care is associated with higher HIV viral load, increased risk for viral transmission, and increased mortality. AAs also are at increased risk of low health literacy, which preliminary evidence suggests may contribute to reduced retention in care. Health literacy—the ability to access, process, and use health information to make informed health decisions— is associated with a variety of poor health outcomes, including poor utilization of available health services, low medication adherence, and increased mortality. Limited evidence is available regarding the effect of health literacy on retention in care. Previous research found that the odds of individuals attending more than 75% of their regularly scheduled HIV/AIDS visits doubled among those who knew the correct value of their HIV viral load or CD4 count. Personal HIV knowledge has also been associated with undetectable HIV viral load and increased CD4 count, but these findings are inconsistent across studies. Among non-HIV/AIDS populations, evidence suggests that health literacy may mediate the relationship between race and health outcomes, but this causal pathway has yet to been examined for retention in HIV/AIDS care. Due to the emerging evidence on the effects of health literacy in retention in care, as well as causal pathways linking health literacy and health outcomes among disparate populations, examination of these pathways on retention in care among AAs living with HIV/AIDS is a necessary next step. The purpose of this F31 fellowship, entitled ENRICH (Examining Retention in Care and Health Literacy), is to utilize an adapted health literacy model to evaluate the effect of health literacy on retention in care and its subsequent effect on racial disparities and HIV clinical outcomes. ENRICH is an ancillary study to a nearly completed R01 study (Project READ—R01 MH092284: PI, D. Waldrop-Valverde) that assessed the association of health literacy on medication discordance. ENRICH will include an additional prospective measure of retention in HIV/AIDS care and HIV clinical outcomes (HIV viral load), captured via medical chart review, among Project READ’s 700 study participants. ENRICH operationalizes retention in care as visit adherence, defined as the proportion of scheduled HIV/AIDS visits kept over a 24-month follow-up period. Reducing health disparities among HIV/AIDS patients is a priority of the Office of AIDS Research and this study will improve understanding of potentially modifiable contributors to health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Low health literacy and poor retention in HIV/AIDS care may contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality of HIV/AIDS among African Americans. The proposed study aims to understand the role of health literacy and retention in care on HIV/AIDS health disparities. Knowledge gained from this study will provide insight into mechanisms underlying health disparities among African Americans living with HIV/AIDS and may inform the development of interventions to improve health literacy and retention in care, in order to reduce health inequities.",Disparities in HIV/AIDS: Examining Retention in Care and Health Literacy (ENRICH),9656887,F31NR017580,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Fellowship ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' cognitive function ', ' Clinic ', ' Visit ', ' medical appointment ', ' AIDS diagnosis ', ' Valverde ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' AIDS population ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' viral transmission ', ' virus transmission ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' visit adherence ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,15254,0.12896428107221455
"PBS NewsHour Health Literacy and Student Reporting Labs: Broad expansion of journalism to increase bioscience literacy in America and support the next generation of biomedical science communicators ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using a combination of high quality broadcast and Web-streamed news reports on emerging public health concerns, youth-generated videos addressing health-related topics, and online curriculum resources, PBS NewsHour will engineer successful public health education experiences that engage the American public, students of all backgrounds - particularly those in underserved populations - to explore biomedical research and emerging health science information as it emerges in academic institutions, private laboratories and public health institutions throughout the country. To identify cutting edge storie of concern to the American public, PBS NewsHour will commission an annual survey of priority public health concerns and then, using that crowdsourced material, work with a blue-ribbon medical advisory council to help identify key experts and material to support in-depth journalism into those topics. The NewsHour aims to engage with the public on issues that are on their minds but then take the reporting to the next level, so that people understand not only what is at stake for them personally, but how what is happening in labs and universities translates into new advances and developments. Social media will be used both to engage with the public and to promote this content. Through this funding and using these stories produced by the award winning PBS NewsHour medical reporting team as a focus, the PBS NewsHour's Student Reporting Labs will experiment with an adaptation of its successful science program to work with eight Labs to produce unique news stories that view health science topics from a youth perspective. These videos will become part of a comprehensive set of lesson plans and learning tools disseminated online to the general public, educators and youth media organizations to draw attention to American health and biomedical issues and careers. Students will be supported with curricula and mentorship on fundamental research practice and the critical thinking skills necessary for responsible journalism. This process will ensure the next generation includes citizens who are effective health science communicators and self-motivated learners with a deep connection to the role of biomedical research in their careers and future life. Youth program resources will be posted on the PBS NewsHour Extra site to serve its 700,000 annual users and our partner sites PBS Learning Media and Share My Lesson - the two biggest free education resource sites on the web. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To increase public health literacy, all sectors of society must have access to the highest-quality health science news and information possible, suited to their learning needs, cognitive capacities, and health concerns.

"Building environmental health literacy: What should people know about endocrine disrupting compounds? PROJECT SUMMARY Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in everyday environments and consumer products can interfere with the body's natural hormone signaling. Examples include some pesticides, fragrances, flame retardants, ingredients in plastics and personal care products, and highly fluorinated substances. While different levels of evidence are available for different chemicals, major scientific bodies now agree there is sufficient evidence of harmful health effects to recommend exposure reduction. The Endocrine Society found support for links to obesity, diabetes, male and female reproduction, cancer, thyroid disruption, and neurodevelopmental effects. To make personal and public decisions about EDCs, people need a functional understanding about these chemicals, including where they come from, how they enter the body and affect health, and options for reducing exposure. This information constitutes EDC environmental health literacy (EDC-EHL). Health literacy is a significant factor in health outcomes and disparities, and EHL is expected to similarly influence individual and population health by supporting positive health behavior. However, interviews with participants who were biomonitored for EDCs reveal only a partial understanding of these exposures, suggesting significant gaps in most people's EDC-EHL. Effective communications must fill these gaps and correct misconceptions while remaining grounded in people's existing knowledge and beliefs. To improve communications, this project will be the first effort to (1) define functional environmental health literacy about everyday EDC exposures and (2) develop and test methods for assessing EDC-EHL. Aim 1 will develop a mental model of EDC-EHL through a series of focus groups. Participants will include researchers and community partners conducting EDC studies, many of whom are supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). This aim will establish goals for public EDC-EHL. Aim 2 will develop an interactive, web-based survey to quantitatively assess people's knowledge and beliefs in comparison with the model from Aim 1. The design will incorporate game-like elements, and participants will receive personalized feedback to stimulate curiosity and motivate completion. The survey will be hosted on LabintheWild, a proven online research platform for behavioral studies, and will be mobile-friendly, since smartphones provide internet access for many people. LabintheWild attracts participants via social media, and partnerships with community organizations and a major employer will improve representation among older, less educated, and racially diverse demographics. The target 1,500 responses will provide preliminary data about EDC-EHL in the general population, and future research can leverage the survey in studies of large representative samples, specific groups, or interventions. Results from both aims will inform effective communications about EDCs and health, meeting a need identified by medical societies and scientific panels and providing immediate guidance for outreach in NIEHS research centers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Health literacy—the ability to obtain and understand health information to make health decisions—is a significant factor in health outcomes and contributes to health disparities. This project extends health literacy to environmental health and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in consumer products, which are recognized as a public health hazard by major scientific bodies. This project provides the foundation for creating effective communications about EDCs and health by (1) defining a model of what people need to know to make informed decisions and (2) gathering preliminary data on people's understanding of the model using a novel, quantitative, web-based instrument.",Building environmental health literacy: What should people know about endocrine disrupting compounds?,9689447,R03ES027884,"['Affect ', ' Androgens ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Belief ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Curiosities ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fertility ', ' Fire Retardants ', ' Flame Retardants ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Pesticides ', ' Plastics ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Medical Societies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Thyroid Gland Hormone ', ' Thyroid Hormones ', ' Translating ', ' Health Hazards ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Social Network ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Food Packaging ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Level of Evidence ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Distant ', ' Source ', ' health knowledge ', ' Endocrine ', ' meetings ', ' consumer product ', ' health science research ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Endocrine Disruptors ', ' endocrine disrupting compound ', ' Endocrine disrupting agent ', ' Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals ', ' Endocrine Disrupter ', ' Outcome ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' population health ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' social media ', ' Formulation ', ' personal care products ', ' thyroid disruption ', ' thyroid hormone disruption ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' recruit ', ' hormonal signals ', ' hormone signals ', ' ']",NIEHS,SILENT SPRING INSTITUTE,R03,2019,74000,0.1231097805364131
"iSIPsmarter: An RCT to evaluate the efficacy, reach, and engagement of a technology-based behavioral and health literacy intervention to reduce sugary beverages among rural Appalachian adults Project Summary: Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB, e.g., soda/pop, sweet tea, sports and energy drinks, fruit drinks) are the largest single food source of calories in the United States (US) diet and contributes approximately 7% of total daily energy intake for US adults. Among Appalachian adults, SSB intake is disproportionately high, averaging about 14% of total daily energy intake. There are strong and consistent data documenting relationships among high SSB consumption and numerous health issues such obesity, diabetes, some obesity-related cancers, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and dental decay. Further compounding the SSB problem, the Appalachian region lacks access to providers, medical services, and evidence-based behavioral prevention programs. There is also limited data on technology-based behavioral interventions in Appalachia. However, given recent progress in shrinking the digital divide, the timing is optimal to evaluate technology-based behavioral interventions in this region. The current proposal is designed to target this major SSB dietary risk factor and public health challenge, as well as address notable gaps in the rural e/m-Health literature. Importantly, this proposal builds on our team’s e/m-Health intervention expertise and decade of SSB behavioral intervention research in rural Appalachia. iSIPsmarter is a technology-based behavioral and health literacy intervention targeting SSB reduction and weight reduction/maintenance. It is comprised of six core Internet-delivered modules, an integrated short message service (SMS) strategy to engage users in tracking SSB behaviors, and a cellular enabled scale for in-home weight tracking. iSIPsmarter is a highly interactive, structured, and self-guided program that uses strategies previously proven to promote behavior change. iSIPsmarter also incorporates a stepped care approach to engage users who struggle to complete components of the intervention. The proposed RCT is guided by the RE-AIM framework and targets 244 adults from rural Appalachia. The overall goal is to examine the efficacy of iSIPsmarter in a 2 group [iSIPsmarter vs. static Patient Education (PE) website] by 4 assessment (Pre, 3-, 6- and 18-month follow-up) design. It is hypothesized that iSIPsmarter will be more efficacious at reducing SSB consumption than a PE website at post assessment. Changes in secondary outcomes (e.g. overall dietary quality, weight, quality of life) and maintenance of outcomes at 6- and 18-months post intervention will also be evaluated. Additional secondary aims include to examine reach and representativeness, patterns of user engagement, and cost. Two tertiary aims include exploratory mediation analyses and a systems-level, participatory process to understand context for future organizational-level adoption of iSIPsmarter, and specifically to explore factors that would promote or inhibit a sustainable SSB screening and referral process. The long-term goal of this line of this research is to sustain an effective, scalable, and high reach behavioral intervention to improve SSB behaviors and weight and to reduce SSB-related health inequities and chronic conditions in rural Appalachia and beyond. Project Narrative: In the US, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is the largest contributor to added sugar intake, with SSB consumption in Appalachia twice as high as national estimates. Excessive SSB is also associated with numerous chronic health conditions (e.g., obesity, some cancers, type II diabetes, heart disease, dental caries). This efficacy trial evaluates a technology-based behavioral and health literacy intervention targeting SSB reduction and weight reduction/maintenance among rural Appalachia adults. The long-term goal of this research is to sustain an effective, scalable, and high reach intervention to improve SSB behaviors and reduce SSB-related inequities and chronic conditions in Appalachia and beyond.","iSIPsmarter: An RCT to evaluate the efficacy, reach, and engagement of a technology-based behavioral and health literacy intervention to reduce sugary beverages among rural Appalachian adults",9939130,R01MD015033,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Beverages ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Community Services ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Persons ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sports ', ' Tea ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Virginia ', ' Voice ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Rural ', ' sugar ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Calories ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' health literacy ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' soda ', ' soft drink ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Obesity related cancer ', ' Obesity associated cancer ', ' cancer type ', ' Consumption ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' medically underserved ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' Rural Appalachian ', ' Rural Appalachia ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,695270,0.02706078201006835
"Addressing Disparities in Language and Social-emotional Skill Acquisition through Literacy Promotion in Primary Care PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Children from low-income Latino backgrounds are at elevated risk for developmental delays that contribute to persistent disparities in school readiness. Early shared reading improves language and social-emotional skill acquisition, which are critical for school readiness, but families from low-income, Latino backgrounds are less likely to engage in this activity. Over the past 30 years, literacy promotion in primary care by encouraging shared reading has evolved into a pediatric standard of care. However, current primary care literacy promotion efforts rely on traditional office-based models with limited outreach and linkage to community-based resources that can help address persistent disparities in early childhood development. In our preliminary work, we identified an intention to behavior gap as a key barrier; low-income Latino parents considered shared reading to be important and intended to read but did not engage in this activity regularly. In response we developed outreach text messages to encourage shared reading beyond the clinic visit in collaboration with key stakeholders including parents. An initial pilot demonstrated feasibility and a positive but partial effect of outreach text messages on the home literacy environment beyond standard literacy promotion. We found that poverty-related life stressors were an important barrier that text messages could not address. Our preliminary work and theory suggest the need for outreach and integrating primary care literacy promotion with poverty- reducing efforts that can promote healthy child development. We propose a 3 arm randomized clinical trial to test strategies designed to enhance literacy promotion for low-income Latino families. We will recruit 630 parent-child dyads from community health centers that serve low-income, Latino families. Parents will be randomly assigned to one of 3 arms (1) Reach Out and Read (ROR) an evidence-based literacy promotion intervention that is widely disseminated in primary care; (2) ROR plus tailored outreach text messages; (3) ROR plus tailored outreach text messages and enhanced access to poverty-reducing resources using a widely disseminated model that simplifies access and provides care coordination. In Aim 1, we will test our hypotheses that (1) children in the ROR plus text message arm will have higher scores on validated assessments of language and social-emotional development compared to standard ROR alone and (2) children who receive both text messages and enhanced access to poverty-reducing resources will have higher scores compared to the other two arms. In Aim 2, we will examine mechanisms that underlie the effects of the interventions. In Aim 3, we will use mixed methods to conduct a process evaluation to understand how the interventions are implemented, identify barriers, facilitators, and adaptations, and explore parents’ experiences with the interventions. This information will help facilitate dissemination of lessons learned across national networks. We expect successful completion of these aims will result in knowledge that can change how primary care interventions are delivered to promote equity in developmental health and school readiness. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children from low-income Latino backgrounds are at elevated risk for delays in language and social-emotional skill acquisition that negatively impact school readiness and perpetuate existing health disparities. Primary care is an innovative, near-universal platform for preventive parenting interventions like literacy promotion a pediatric care standard that can help mitigate these disparities. The current proposal tests novel approaches to literacy promotion that have the potential to change the way primary care interventions are designed and implemented to promote equity in developmental health and school readiness.",Addressing Disparities in Language and Social-emotional Skill Acquisition through Literacy Promotion in Primary Care,9973707,R01HD099125,"['Academy ', ' Behavior ', ' Books ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Language ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hearing ', ' Housing ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Case Management ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' skills ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' underclass ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Intake ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' skill development ', ' skill acquisition ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' intervention effect ', ' alleviating poverty ', ' poverty alleviation ', ' arm ', ' lower income families ', ' recruit ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NICHD,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,639052,0.025776136150322745
"Enhancing Health Literacy in Surgery (EHLIS) to Eliminate Surgical Disparities for African-Americans with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) PROJECT SUMMARY Rationale: In the United States, over 3.1 million people suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which includes Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Most patients will require major surgery in their lifetime. As the incidence of IBD rises in racial/ethnic minority populations, surgical disparities are emerging with significantly worse outcomes for African-Americans compared to whites. Recent data has suggested a potential role of health literacy in determining surgical outcomes (and disparities), but, to our knowledge, no literacy-based interventions in surgery exist. This project aims to address surgical disparities through the development of a health literate surgical care program to eliminate disparities for African-Americans with IBD. These project goals would support the core missions of the NIHMD and Healthy People 2020 in achieving health equity for all patients. Objectives: My long-term career objective is to become an independent researcher focused on identifying, understanding and eliminating surgical disparities. Through this career development award, my remaining gaps in knowledge and skills will be filled through a personalized three-year training program that will include didactics (for an MSPH), mini-sabbaticals and mentorship by an experienced mentor team. These plans will support my research goals: (i) to identify factors that impact health literacy in current surgical care programs and (ii) to develop a health literate and culturally-competent surgical care program through stakeholder engagement. Design and Methods: Our study will use a mixed-method formative research approach with significant stakeholder engagement. Guided by the Health Literacy and Outcomes Framework, we will first use qualitative methods (key informant interviews/focus groups) to identify gaps in current surgical care that may impact an African-American IBD patient’s capacity to obtain, process and understand surgical information (Specific Aim 1a). We will then develop stakeholder-centered quantitative assessments to confirm the qualitative findings (Specific Aim 1b). We will finally use an iterative multidimensional stakeholder engagement process to design a health literate surgical care program (“Enhancing Health Literacy in Surgery” or EHLIS) (Specific Aim 2). We will conduct this study at a high-volume, tertiary-care IBD center that serves a high-proportion of African-Americans with IBD. The results of this study will provide the data for an R21 submission to examine EHLIS feasibility, which, in turn, will inform a larger randomized trial (R01/PCORI). Significance: In conjunction with my career development/training plans, this project will inform the development of a health literate intervention focused on improving surgical outcomes and eliminating disparities in African- American IBD patients undergoing major surgery. Lessons learned could have much broader implications in other surgical populations as surgical disparities exist in all disciplines and innovative interventions are needed. RELEVANCE African-Americans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often faced with major surgery and represent a growing population at high-risk for surgical disparities. The proposed research focuses on eliminating these disparities by developing a surgical care program crafted with health literacy-based interventions. Successful development of a health literate surgical care program has the potential to positively impact the African-American IBD population and may offer a patient-centered approach to addressing surgical disparities in other vulnerable surgical populations.",Enhancing Health Literacy in Surgery (EHLIS) to Eliminate Surgical Disparities for African-Americans with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD),9934227,K23MD013903,"['patient-provider communication ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' readmission rates ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgery risk ', ' surgical risk ', ' Academy ', ' Affect ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Complication ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's "", "" Crohn's disorder "", ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' regional enteritis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fistula ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Interview ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' literacy ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obstruction ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Ostomy ', ' surgical construction of a stoma ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Visual Aid ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' Malnutrition ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' literate ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' Readability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' tertiary care ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' high risk ', ' health equity ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' sabbatical ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K23,2020,144249,0.15227579774315236
"Development and Assessment of a Spanish-Language Toolkit for Hearing Loss Self-Management Disparities in hearing healthcare (HHC) persist between Hispanic/Latino adults and non-Hispanic/Latino Whites, despite similar hearing loss prevalence rates. Limited English language proficiency (LEP) significantly and neg- atively impacts general healthcare access and utilization, but interventions that take into account the preferred language and culture of patients have been shown to reduce or eliminate disparities in many areas of healthcare. Yet there is a fundamental gap in the current understanding as to whether addressing LEP will alleviate dispari- ties in HHC for Hispanic/Latino older adults. As untreated hearing loss is associated with increased risks of costly health outcomes, there is an urgent need to improve HHC service delivery, particularly to vulnerable populations such as those with LEP. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop hearing loss interventions that address the needs of vulnerable populations in the US. The overall objective of the current proposal, which is the next step toward attainment of the applicant's long-term goal, is to develop and assess the benefits of printable, Spanish- language hearing loss self-management patient education materials. The central hypothesis is that participants will demonstrate better understanding of their hearing loss difficulties, and will be better able to identify options for self-management following delivery of culturally and linguistically appropriate patient education materials. The rationale for the proposed research is that findings will contribute to the development and testing of novel inter- ventions aimed at increasing HHC access and utilization in vulnerable populations. Guided by preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Using an iterative approach with members from the target audience, develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate Spanish-language hearing loss self-man- agement program that takes into account varying health literacy backgrounds; and 2) Assess the benefits for Spanish-speaking adults with hearing loss, in terms of HHC knowledge and self-efficacy for managing hearing loss, following delivery of a Spanish-language hearing loss self-management program. Aim #1 will be addressed through utilizing focus groups consisting of representatives of the target audience to develop the education ma- terials. Aim #2 will be addressed by comparing self-efficacy for managing hearing loss in a single-group, pre/post design with 53 Hispanic/Latino adults with hearing loss who have LEP. These aims in line with advancing the overall mission of the NIDCD to “help prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat disease and disability”, as well as NIDCD's 2017-2022 Strategic Plan to address hearing health disparities. This contribution is expected to be significant because it poses to reduce language barriers to HHC experienced by US adults from Hispanic/Latino background with LEP. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by delivering a hearing loss intervention that addresses the intersection of LEP and health literacy. It is expected that results will provide compelling data to include in a future R01 application aimed at reducing structural and clinical barriers to HHC access and utilization for vulnerable populations in the US. Currently there is a scarcity of hearing loss interventions that address the literacy, cultural, and linguistic needs of the growing population of older adults from Hispanic/Latino background in the US. The outcomes of this study will address a pressing public health need to increase hearing health literacy and hearing loss self-management among older Hispanic/Latino adults with limited English language proficiency.

"Sexual  Health  Empowerment  for  Jail-Involved  Women's  Health  Literacy  and  Prevention ABSTRACT  Over the last 35 years, there has been a 700% increase in the number of women in prisons and jails. These women, mostly women of color, have pervasive trauma histories, mental health problems, and drug use, all of which compromise their ability to engage in preventive health behaviors. For the last eight years, our research team has studied women leaving jail and why they are 4-5 times more likely to develop cervical cancer, a disparity that has remained unchanged for over 50 years. The original objective of the Sexual Health Empowerment (SHE) for Cervical Health Literacy and Prevention program (R01 CA181047) was to assess the effectiveness of a jail-based intervention to increase cervical health literacy and screening. SHE increased jailed women’s cervical health literacy and rates of cancer screening after the women left jail.  While delivering SHE, we observed: 1) the cross-cutting nature of women’s health risk factors, i.e. the risks that jailed women faced for cervical cancer also could lead to other women’s health problems; and 2) opportunity for taking an evidence-based intervention, with a rich theoretical framing, to expand to other women’s health issues faced by this group, around, not only cervical cancer prevention, but also breast cancer, unintended pregnancy, and STI prevention. While following women after release from jail (85% follow-up rate after 3 years), we also identified strategies for reaching this high-risk population through electronic communication. SHE participants were high users of mobile phones (88%), text (76%), Web (79%), and Facebook (70%). This renewal application presents an opportunity to holistically address health disparities experienced by women leaving jail and test new modalities for intervention delivery given their use of electronic communication and social media.  In our first aim, we will assess the feasibility and pilot effectiveness of ‘SHE-Women’, an electronic women’s health literacy intervention, with women leaving jail. The second aim uses an RCT to test the effectiveness of SHE-Women with women leaving jail on increasing women’s health literacy, screening, and risk reduction practices (for cervical, breast cancer, unintended pregnancy, and STIs) against a standard of care. Our third aim will be to understand the role and impact of human interaction in electronic interventions by tracking participants and interviewing key stakeholders. Knowledge gained from this study will lead to an understanding of: 1) how a comprehensive women’s health literacy intervention can narrow health disparities among justice-involved women and 2) the role of human interaction in successful electronic interventions, thereby creating a sustainable model for dissemination of health promotion interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The key contributions of this study are to determine whether a comprehensive women’s health literacy intervention is effective at changing intersecting behaviors among women leaving jail; whether an electronic women’s health literacy intervention is feasible and effective; and how much human “touch” is ideal in an electronic intervention. Knowledge gained from this study will help develop a new paradigm for mitigating health disparities among vulnerable women.",Sexual  Health  Empowerment  for  Jail-Involved  Women's  Health  Literacy  and  Prevention,9920093,R01CA181047,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Color ', ' Communications Media ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Discharge Plannings ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Justice ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' literacy ', ' Literacy Programs ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Perception ', ' Prisons ', ' Productivity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cervical ', ' Left ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' uptake ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer prevention ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Nature ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' Knowledge ', ' behavior change ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Health Educators ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Jail ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Modification ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' post intervention ', ' birth control ', ' health literacy ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' health empowerment ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' pregnant ', ' standard of care ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' social media ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' STD prevention ', ' prevent sexually transmitted disease ', ' prevent sexually transmitted infections ', ' sexually transmitted disease prevention ', ' sexually transmitted infection prevention ', ' STI prevention ', ' Facebook ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,302674,0.05584073631507868
"OAI Consortium: Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program (HWWTP) and Environmental Career Worker Training Program (ECWTP) OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT OAI, a Chicago community-based agency, proposes to implement HWWT and ECWT Consortia. HWWT will target three populations: 1) underfunded rural and volunteer Emergency First Responders 2) Transitional and Temporary Workers and high school dropouts, and 3) Non Union Workers, including Hispanic hazardous waste handlers. Over 5 years, HWWT will train 23,470 students in 19 states and generate 253,660 contact hours. ECWT will assist unemployed African Americans, Hispanics, women, ex-offenders, and veterans who face multiple barriers to employment in Chicago, Dallas and Kansas City by training a total of 420 participants, placing 355 (85%) in jobs and generating 169,440-211,800 instructional contact hours. Significance: Both Consortia target the underserved and address public health disparities, prevention, and protection of workers, EJ residents and their communities from exposure to hazardous substances. ECWT responds to the underrepresentation of disadvantaged residents in the construction/environmental workforce. Leadership and Capacity: OAI has been a WTP grantee since 1995, led by the same PI who has 32 years of experience in adult education, workforce development, and grants management. She will be supported by a team of health and safety professionals (IH, CIH) and others with requisite credentials and proven expertise. Innovation: Best practices and innovations of both Consortia include: the implementation of Social Ecological Model (SEM) and Economic Impact Study evaluation plan, integration of Climate Change and Community Resiliency into existing curricula, and Blended Learning. ECWT will continue to refine a unique Try-Outs selection process and demonstrate the Alumni Mentors retention strategy. HWWT will pilot a bilingual Train-the-Trainer model for Vietnamese nail salon workers integrating hazard awareness, SEM, 3Rs (reduction, reuse, and recycling), cultural competence, and community resiliency. Approach: HWWT will deliver direct training instruction via local peer trainers. As a strategy to build local capacity and sustainability, it will customize its Train-the-Trainer model to meet the needs of target populations. ECWT will provide Core Health & Safety Courses; Career Specific Training (Environmental/ Construction, Commercial Truck Driving/Hazmat Endorsement & Warehousing training, Water & Wastewater Operations, and Advanced Construction); Core Soft Skills Training; Supportive Services; and Career Guidance.

"Information visualizations to facilitate clinician-patient communication in HIV care (Info Viz: HIV) PROJECT SUMMARY The research in this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award is aligned with the National Institute of Nursing Research’s scientific focus area of improving self-management strategies for individuals with chronic conditions. Additionally, this award will provide the protected time, advanced training, and research experience that the candidate needs to further develop her program of research aimed at promoting health and reducing health disparities among Latinos with low health literacy. This study builds on previous NIH-funded pre- and postdoctoral research (T32 NR013454, T32 NR007969) and aims to evaluate infographics which are evidence-based, culturally appropriate, and methodically designed images to facilitate clinician-patient HIV-related communication. HIV is a complex chronic illness for which effective self-management requires persons living with HIV (PLWH) to acquire, understand, and utilize large amounts of health information. By using rigorously designed and evaluated infographics during clinical encounters, clinicians may provide the information PLWH need for effective self-management in a more meaningful way.  During the first year of the K99, the candidate will assess the extent to which the infographics she developed through her postdoctoral work are a feasible and useful method to facilitate information exchange and improve outcomes among PLWH with low health literacy. To ensure cultural relevance, this feasibility trial of infographic use during clinical visits in a limited resource setting will take place at Clínica de Familia in La Romana in the Dominican Republic (DR). Beyond ensuring cultural appropriateness, this study builds on previous work conducted at the Clinic and a well-established relationship with the organization will ensure long-term project success. The second year of the K99 will take place at Columbia University School of Nursing in New York City, and will include advanced training in statistical analysis, design and implementation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), theory and measurement of acculturation and cultural influences on health, communication methods with individuals who have low health literacy, and automation of infographics through coursework, seminars, and interdisciplinary collaboration. During the R00 phase, a multi-site RCT will be used to assess the efficacy of using infographics during normal clinic visits to improve short, medium, and long- term treatment outcomes among PLWH in the United States (US) and in the DR. How infographic use influences clinician-patient communication and treatment outcomes in both settings will also be compared.  Through rigorous refinement and evaluation of a novel method to enhance HIV-related communication between health care providers and Latino PLWH with low health literacy in the US and abroad, findings will contribute to the evidence- base regarding methodically generated, culturally appropriate infographic design and communication methodologies that can lead to better health outcomes among Latino patients globally. Additionally, by ensuring the time and support needed to solidify her program of research, this award will advance the candidate towards becoming an independently funded nurse scientist seeking to promote health and reduce health disparities through evidenced-based informatics interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Effective self-management of chronic conditions, such as HIV infection, is dependent on the affected individual's ability to acquire, understand, and use relevant health information. Infographics are methodically designed images that can assist clinicians in communicating the specific information that patients need in a comprehensible and useable way. This project aims to evaluate and refine a set of culturally appropriate HIV-related infographics to facilitate clinician-patient communication and improve health outcomes for Latinos living with

"Integrating Information Resources to Promote Environmental Health Literacy in Appalachian Kentucky PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health disparities in Appalachian Kentucky have been well-documented, with many chronic health conditions disproportionately experienced across the region linked to environmental contributors. Deteriorating infrastructure, inappropriate waste disposal, and risks related to mining, agriculture, and other occupational activities underscore the need for this at-risk population to receive clear, timely, and accessible information about potential environmental health threats to support important decisions about preventive and protective actions. Unfortunately, creating easily understandable resources and tools can prove especially challenging in a region where educational attainment falls well below national averages, with nearly one-quarter of adults over age 25 lacking high school diplomas and only about one-fifth holding an associate's degree or higher. Therefore, improving environmental health literacy (EHL) in the region is critical. EHL uses information and methods from health, social, and environmental sciences to promote understanding of the relationship between environmental exposures and human health. Such understanding can spur individual and/or community actions to minimize unnecessary exposures and mitigate illness related to unavoidable exposures. To this end, it is critical that existing information resources be evaluated, integrated, improved, and made more accessible to help improve EHL and inform environmental health decisions. To address these needs, our multidisciplinary team will deploy stakeholder-engaged research strategies to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1) evaluate existing environmental health-related risk maps currently available from academic, government, and non-profit organizations to determine resource accessibility, navigability, understandability, and perceived utility for Appalachian Kentuckians; 2) conduct needs assessments to identify additional information and appropriate framing required to improve understandability and utility of environmental health-related risk maps for Appalachian Kentuckians; 3) use information gathered in Aims 1 and 2 to enhance maps through the inclusion of critical health-related information in accessible formats, as well as through potential changes to the visualizations themselves to improve understandability; and 4) leverage stakeholder- partnerships developed through the study to disseminate revised maps and additional environmental health resources through community organizations, thereby promoting EHL across the region. PROJECT NARRATIVE Health disparities in Appalachian Kentucky have been well-documented and are driven by many factors, including challenging socioeconomic conditions and low levels of educational attainment, exacerbated by environmental concerns about deteriorating infrastructure, inappropriate waste disposal, and risks related to mining, agriculture, and other occupational activities. This study strives to mitigate these disparities by building regional environmental health literacy through the development, integration, refinement, and provision of timely, understandable, and accessible information about potential environmental health threats and evidence-based preventive and protective actions.

"Developing an implementation strategy for post-concussion communication with low health literacy parents in the emergency department PROJECT SUMMARY Parents can play an important role in evidence-based concussion management by (1) monitoring their child's activity and level of stimulation, (2) communicating with school personnel about potential need for short-term academic accommodations, and (3) ensuring their child does not return to contact or collision sport prematurely and risk greater injury. However, not all parents follow these evidence-based guidelines, in part due to health literacy deficits, and further compounded by the poor fit and inconsistent implementation of educational materials. The initial medical encounter following a concussion provides an important opportunity for evidence-based knowledge translation to parents. Families at risk of low health literacy most often seek initial post-concussion care in emergency departments (ED) and often do not follow-up with a primary care provider or concussion specialist. Knowledge translation to parents in the ED is often inconsistent in terms of content and delivery, and existing approaches often do not meet the needs of families with low health literacy. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Re-Engineered Discharge (RED) Toolkit provides an evidence-based approach to supporting the implementation of parent education that has not as yet been adapted for use post-concussion in the ED setting. Aim 1: Develop toolkit to support evidence-based parent education post-concussion in the ED. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will adapt the AHRQ RED Toolkit to facilitate post-concussion parent education in the ED. The evidence-based parent education to be shared will be the CDC Acute Concussion Care Plan, adapted to meet learning needs of parents with low health literacy and limited English proficiency. We will use parent and provider interviews to iteratively develop the implementation toolkit (provider training, checklists, EHR support, downloadable parent materials) in consultation with an advisory board comprised of providers and parents. Aim 2: Conduct a hybrid implementation-effectiveness evaluation of the educational intervention. Guided by the RE-AIM framework, our primary outcomes will be the reach, acceptability, and implementation of the post-concussion education intervention. We will also explore whether successful implementation is associated with (1) improved parent knowledge and self-efficacy related to helping their child adhere to CDC guidelines for returning to daily activities, school and sports, and (2) decreased disparity in knowledge and self- efficacy between high and low health literacy parents. Achieving these aims will result in a scalable approach to the implementation of the CDC's ACE Care Plan in the pediatric ED post-concussion. If parents are better able to follow evidence-based guidelines for concussion, they will better advocate and care for their children, and this should improve outcomes for all youth. More broadly, achieving these aims will provide a model for engaging low health literacy parents in adapting evidence-based educational practices for implementation in ED settings. NARRATIVE Inconsistent implementation of concussion education for parents in Emergency Department settings contributes to inequities in post-concussion outcomes for youth. This project seeks to develop an implementation toolkit for evidence-based parent concussion education in the Emergency Department based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Re-Engineered Discharge (RED) Toolkit. A pilot hybrid implementation effectiveness evaluation of the adapted intervention will subsequently be conducted.",Developing an implementation strategy for post-concussion communication with low health literacy parents in the emergency department,9996805,R21NS111065,"['Behavior ', ' Brain Concussion ', ' Cerebral Concussion ', ' Commotio Cerebri ', ' concussion ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Consultations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Engineering ', ' Family ', ' Craniocerebral Trauma ', ' Craniocerebral Injuries ', ' Head Injuries ', ' Head Trauma ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Reading ', ' Recreation ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sports ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' AHCPR ', ' AHRQ ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' Instructional Models ', ' educational methods ', ' educational practices ', ' educational principles ', ' Educational Models ', ' Guidelines ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Services ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' peer ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' health related quality of life ', ' implementation research ', ' injured child ', ' injured children ', ' injury in children ', ' pediatric injury ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' knowledge translation ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' improved outcome ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' pediatric emergency ', ' implementation strategy ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NINDS,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,187500,0.10960736901887329
"PBS NewsHour Health Literacy and Student Reporting Labs: Broad expansion of journalism to increase bioscience literacy in America and support the next generation of biomedical science communicators ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using a combination of high quality broadcast and Web-streamed news reports on emerging public health concerns, youth-generated videos addressing health-related topics, and online curriculum resources, PBS NewsHour will engineer successful public health education experiences that engage the American public, students of all backgrounds - particularly those in underserved populations - to explore biomedical research and emerging health science information as it emerges in academic institutions, private laboratories and public health institutions throughout the country. To identify cutting edge storie of concern to the American public, PBS NewsHour will commission an annual survey of priority public health concerns and then, using that crowdsourced material, work with a blue-ribbon medical advisory council to help identify key experts and material to support in-depth journalism into those topics. The NewsHour aims to engage with the public on issues that are on their minds but then take the reporting to the next level, so that people understand not only what is at stake for them personally, but how what is happening in labs and universities translates into new advances and developments. Social media will be used both to engage with the public and to promote this content. Through this funding and using these stories produced by the award winning PBS NewsHour medical reporting team as a focus, the PBS NewsHour's Student Reporting Labs will experiment with an adaptation of its successful science program to work with eight Labs to produce unique news stories that view health science topics from a youth perspective. These videos will become part of a comprehensive set of lesson plans and learning tools disseminated online to the general public, educators and youth media organizations to draw attention to American health and biomedical issues and careers. Students will be supported with curricula and mentorship on fundamental research practice and the critical thinking skills necessary for responsible journalism. This process will ensure the next generation includes citizens who are effective health science communicators and self-motivated learners with a deep connection to the role of biomedical research in their careers and future life.

"COMPRENDO: Adaptation and Implementation of a Peer-Navigation Intervention to Improve Research Literacy and Diversity in Pediatric Leukemia Clinical Trials ABSTRACT Childhood cancer is the leading cause of child death by disease past infancy in the US. While survival has improved, mainly due to patient participation in clinical trials, critical racial/ethnic disparities remain. Compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) children, Hispanics have higher incidence of leukemia and poorer survival rates. Although Hispanics will comprise 33% of the U.S. childhood population by 2060, their participation in biomedical research is critically low and, as shown in our prior work, Hispanics are underrepresented in pediatric cancer research. As a result, outcomes data are obtained mostly from NHW. Our preliminary data, and research from others, suggest that adequate informed consent and low research literacy (capacity to understand and act on information to make decisions about research) are barriers to minority participation in clinical trials. Interventions to improve research literacy and clinical trial participation, particularly for Hispanics, are lacking. There is an urgent need to fill this gap in knowledge, as tailored interventions guided by implementation science can improve research literacy and minority participation in clinical trials. The objective of this K08 is to improve research literacy in parents of children with leukemia by adapting (from the patient- navigation model) and implementing “COMPRENDO” (ChildhOod Malignancy Peer REsearch NavigatiOn), a tailored peer-navigation intervention (PNI). Our hypothesis and rationale are that PNIs guided by implementation science, in which trained peers deliver culturally and linguistically concordant education to parents during informed consent, can identify and address barriers to: a) adequate research literacy, and b) equitable clinical trial participation. By increasing minority participation in clinical trials, we can effectively translate discoveries and treatments, and, ultimately, improve equity of survival in diverse populations, which is a top priority for NCI. We propose to implement COMPRENDO to improve parental research literacy in pediatric leukemia clinical trials, using mixed-methods and implementation science (Aim 1). We will compare the effectiveness of COMPRENDO vs. usual care in improving research literacy outcomes among parents of children with leukemia (Aim 2) using a Hybrid Trial Type 1 effectiveness and implementation design. We hypothesize that, compared to usual care, parents randomized to the PNI will show higher comprehension, voluntariness, and accrual and lower mistrust post informed consent discussion and 4 weeks post intervention. This K08 award builds on the formative work of the PI in bioethics and pediatric cancer disparities and maps on to the PI’s training goals in implementation science, intervention adaptation, qualitative methods, and behavioral clinical trial design. This K08 has an important impact: knowledge gained can be generalized to Hispanics across the lifespan and will help to: a) inform clinical care, and b) design a multi-site randomized clinical trial, in which COMPRENDO will be tested in a larger sample of Hispanics with a broader range of cancers in a future R01, enabling the PI’s transition to independence as a successful physician-scientist. NARRATIVE Whereas Hispanic children will comprise 33% of the U.S. population and have higher incidence of certain cancers, their participation in biomedical research is critically low and they have poorer survival rates than non- Hispanic Whites.

"Using epigenetic science to improve environmental health literacy Project Summary/Abstract NIEHS defines environmental health as “the field of science that studies how the environment influences human health and disease”. The environment in this definition includes the natural environment, man-made chemicals and structures that often pollute the natural environment, and our social interactions and lifestyle choices. Because toxic environments are linked directly to human health and disease, a critical need exists to educate the American population on this relationship to allow us to make informed choices about the amount of risk we are willing to take. Stated differently, to improve public health we need to improve environmental health literacy (EHL), which is the goal of RFA-ES-19-005 (Innovative Approaches for Improving Environmental Health Literacy). The RFA requests collaborations between small businesses and environmental scientists “to develop novel tools, activities, or materials to build EHL”. In response, Nzumbe Inc. (Portland, OR) has partnered with environmental and education scientists at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) (Portland, OR) and local undergraduate institutions to submit this proposal. We will use epigenetic science as an education bridge to improve EHL because the basics of this science are relatively easy to understand and the epigenome (the sum total of all epigenetic modifications) responds to environmental exposures in ways that can improve or worsen health. Two complementary specific aims are proposed for this Phase 1 application, which will focus on undergraduate education. The first is to create interactive and gamified software based on epigenetic science that undergraduate educators can use to teach students about environmental health. The prototype mobile app will allow students to create scenarios in which identical twins receive an unhealthy exposure in utero known to change epigenetic patterns and suspected to cause disease later in life. The students will then choose different combinations of diet, exercise, and lifestyle choices for each twin that are also known to change epigenetic patterns to attempt to counter over a virtual lifetime the negative early life exposure. The students will be scored based on their choices with the ability to compare results with classmates and students at other institutions. The second Aim will create a prototype laboratory kit focused on epigenetic science that will provide fundamental information about environmental epigenetics. The kit will use a simple epigenetic model system, the fungus Neurospora crassa. We will engineer a Neurospora strain with a reporter gene that is epigenetically silenced by DNA methylation and sensitive to activation. Students will choose different exposures and then measure activation and DNA methylation of the reporter gene. Results will be reported to an accompanying software application module where students can compare their results with classmates and other schools to identify exposures with epigenetic activity. Successful completion of the proposed work will lead to Phase II funding to complete these modules and modify and extend them to public school students and the interactive software to the lay public and public health professionals. Project Narrative Improving environmental health literacy (EHL) will lead to people making informed choices resulting in better public health.

"Training At-Risk Industrial, Telecommunication and Immigrant Workers to Assess and Improve their Health and Safety Conditions Program Summary/Abstract (Overall) The Steelworkers Charitable and Educational Organization (SCEO), the non-profit (501c3) arm of the United Steelworkers (USW), is applying for HWWTP and HDPTP funds to support a vibrant training partnership linking two of the largest U.S.-based industrial unions with rapidly expanding immigrant worker centers and Tribal communities. The SCEO’s training entity, the Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC), brings together the USW, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the Labor Institute (LI), the National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON), Make the Road New York (MRNY) and the Umatilla, Cayuse, Walla Walla, Yakama, and Nez Perce Tribes. Through the HWWTP five-year program, we will conduct 2,265 courses to reach 50,075 workers, managers, community residents and Tribal members with 545,200 hours of training to help prevent toxic releases, fires, explosions, injuries, sickness and death. A primary focus is on training and mentoring union, immigrant and Tribal H&S advocates to promote concrete and lasting prevention at their worksites and on their Tribal lands. The HDPTP program will expand our multi-lingual team of Specialized Emergency Response Trainers (SERTs) from 9 to 15 members. SERTs are prepared to go anywhere at any time to provide pre- and post-incident training for high-hazard workers and community responders. Also, we will develop 25 Disaster Response Hubs at high-hazard sites, in worker centers and on Tribal lands to serve as locations for pre- and post-incident training and related activities. SERTS will also serve on our Opioids working group to provide training in response to this major health crisis. Our HDPTP program will offer 190 classes that will provide 3,475 at- risk workers with 35,600 hours of training. Target Populations: The TMC has access to over 6,000 workplaces and worker centers including the USW (600,000 members), the CWA (600,000 members), NDLON (55 worker centers) and MRNY (23,000 members at 5 centers). TMC Tribal partners include Umatilla, Cayuse, and Walla Walla (3,000 members); the Yakama (31,000); and the Nez Perce (18,800). Our training populations are employed in metal mining, refining, milling and manufacturing; telecommunications; transportation; oil refining, pulp and paper mills and manufacturing; chemical manufacturing and synthesis; nuclear energy; rubber and plastics; pharmaceuticals; automobile parts; electrical, appliance and other manufacturing; cement; construction; shipbuilding; health care, and education. Immigrant day-laborers and temporary workers are employed in clean-up activities, especially during emergencies; construction; cleaning; home care; warehousing; and distribution. Tribal workers engage in emergency services including fire, police, and medical services as well as in the construction trades. Approximately 850,000 of these workers are potentially exposed to hazardous substances covered by OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910, EPA 40 CFR 311, and DOT 49 CFR 171-177. Project Narrative: Using our cadre of 190 USW, CWA, immigrant worker center and Tribal trainers we will provide HAZMAT, HAZWOPER and related OSHA training to those who produce, work with, dispose of and transport billions of pounds of hazardous substances and wastes. Our target populations are 1) high hazard unionized workers, especially those who must respond to emergencies; 2) immigrant day laborers who are hired from street corners to engage in clean up and (re)construction activities; and 3) Tribal members who must respond to a growing number of toxic spills and weather-related disasters on their lands. Our mission is to bring high quality model education to thousands of workers who currently receive insufficient training on the hazards they face so that at-risk workers can better protect themselves, their co-workers and their communities.","Training At-Risk Industrial, Telecommunication and Immigrant Workers to Assess and Improve their Health and Safety Conditions",10055882,U45ES006175,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Americas ', ' Automobiles ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dental Pulp ', ' pulp ', ' Disasters ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Fires ', ' fire ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' HAZMAT ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' haz mat ', ' Hazardous Waste ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metals ', ' Mining ', ' Mission ', ' New York ', ' Nuclear Energy ', ' Atomic Energy ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Oils ', ' Paper ', ' Plastics ', ' Poison ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' toxic compound ', ' Production ', ' Program Development ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rubber ', ' Latex Rubber ', ' natural Rubber ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telecommunications ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Transportation ', ' Tribes ', ' Weather ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Police ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' Workplace ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Home Care ', ' patient homecare ', ' patient home care ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Multilingualism ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Occupational ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' retired people ', ' retired person ', ' retiree ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Advocate ', ' R25 Mechanism ', ' R25 Program ', ' Education Projects ', ' Reservations ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' tribe member ', ' tribal member ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' tribal community ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' Population ', ' Tribal Council ', ' community organizations ', ' health training ', ' combat ', ' Toxics Release Inventory ', ' arm ', ' Emergency response ', ' model building ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid use ', ' underserved minority ', ' Yakama ', ' Yakama Indian ', ' tribal lands ', ' minority communities ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' HAZWOPER ', ' Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response ', ' ']",NIEHS,STEELWORKER CHARITABLE/EDUCATIONAL ORG,U45,2020,2310516,0.053451716151842084
"American Samoa Indigenous Samoan Partnership to Initiate REsearch Excellence (INSPIRE) in Colorectal Cancer Health Literacy Project Abstract Very little information regarding the health status of American Samoans are available, and the research infrastructure in America Samoa (AS) requires a sufficient foundation and capacity building to conduct large-scale population health research. The purpose of this project is to: (1) build the research capacity in America Samoa to conduct population health research, and (2) to support a pilot health research project that aims to increase colorectal cancer screening literacy among American Samoans so that initial data will be available and serve as the foundation for future research efforts in America Samoa. This project is a collaborative community and research engaged effort that reflects the community-identified priorities in AS addressing a research gaps in health promotion and cancer prevention. The percentage of American Samoan adults aged 50-75 obtaining CRC screening is far below the US national average, i.e., 7% of American Samoans vs. 58.2% of US adults. Assessment of health literacy levels has been recommended in specific populations and to use assessment results in developing targeted and tailored promotional programs. The proposed Indigenous Samoan Program to Initiate Research Excellence (INSPIRE) – CRC Literacy. (INSPIRE) aims to: (1) strengthen research capacity by providing technical assistance on research protocol, IRB training, and development of an easily accessed cancer data repository, (2) adapt/pilot the Short form Test of Functional Health Literacy – Adults (STOFHLA) and administer revision to a representative sample of older adults recruited through Respondent Driven Sampling methods, and (3) informed by STOFHLA results, develop and implement a culturally competent, linguistically appropriate, and theory-informed screening intervention, use of a 2 group pre-post control group comparison, with measurement of Knowledge-Attitude- Behavior (KAB) survey at several points of evaluation and assessment of the primary outcome namely, timely completion of Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT). INSPIRE efforts will be led by the AS Community Cancer Coalition in partnership with LBJ Tropical Medical Center (LBJTMC), the AS Department of Health and dedicated technical assistance from consultants associated with the University of Hawai`i and Azusa Pacific University in California, with consultant expertise in health literacy, RDS, cancer screening research, STOFHLA, community-based participatory approaches, multi-modal research/evaluation strategies, and history of positive collaboration with AS partners. This effort should result in increased screening use and contribute to building a foundation for future translational research. INSPIRE-produced research is significant for AS because it lays a much needed foundation for systematic public health research. Further, INSPIRE research will contribute to advancement in the science of health literacy and health promotions with/for resource-poor, yet tradition-rich Indigenous communities thereby, offering the hopeful prospect of eliminating socially-constructed and harmful health inequalities. Project Narrative INSPIRE aims are to increase research capacity in American Samoa and to conduct a pilot research project ton colorectal cancer screening literacy.

"Assessing the Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Women with Experience in the Criminal Probation System PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In response to NOT-MD-20-019, this administrative supplement will examine the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and related local public health mandates (e.g., Shelter in Place) in a population of women heavily affected by health disparities. Our parent study of health literacy and health care utilization among women in the criminal probation system (R01MD010439) maintains a cohort of 370 women, 73% of whom are African American and 82% of whom have one or more chronic health condition. Emerging research indicates that these characteristics are linked with disparities in COVID-19 risk, infection, and mortality. Our community- based study, located in Oakland (Alameda County), California, adapted to the formal Shelter-in-Place order, beginning March 17, 2020, by modifying data collection from in-person interviews to telephone-based interviews. Given the public health crisis and reports from participants about its immediate impacts, we began collecting data in May 2020 to systematically assess the medical and social consequences of the outbreak. Coupling these new data with 12 months of longitudinal data obtained prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we propose to conduct a series of rigorous analyses to address the following Specific Aims: (1) To assess changes in health care access and utilization associated with the COVID-19 outbreak and related local public health mandates (e.g., shelter in place) (2) To examine how health literacy and social determinants (e.g., housing, income) are associated with adherence to public health mandates and participation in COVID-19 screening. The proposed supplement furthers the objectives of NOT-MD-20-019 by addressing the urgent need to understand how COVID-19 and related public health mandates are contributing to health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will assess how COVID-19 impacts health care access and utilization in a group of women who have high levels of chronic illness and social disadvantages such as homelessness. It will also examine conditions that contribute to their ability to follow public health mandates like sheltering in place and social distancing.",Assessing the Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Women with Experience in the Criminal Probation System,10156795,R01MD010439,"['Affect ', ' California ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Paper ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Social Distance ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Schedule ', ' shelter ', ' shelter-housing ', ' Shelter facility ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' homeless ', ' unhoused ', ' Homelessness ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' System ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' transitionally housed ', ' transitional housing ', ' probation ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' health literacy ', ' instably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' unstably housed ', ' housing instability ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Coupling ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' screening ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' study population ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' social vulnerability ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' social disadvantage ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' ']",NIMHD,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2020,176013,0.09304674809799003
"Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) is a highly productive research network that is essential to advancing the science and practice of pediatric critical care medicine. The overall aim of this renewal application is for Wayne State University (WSU), under the leadership of Kathleen Meert, MD, to continue as a clinical site in the CPCCRN. Dr. Meert, PI for the CPCCRN at WSU for the past 10 years, is a pediatric intensivist with a wealth of clinical and translational research experienc and an established track record of scientific publications for the CPCCRN. Additionally, Dr. Meert has demonstrated research expertise in behavioral medicine and communication science. Strengths of WSU as a clinical site include the Children s Hospital of Michigan (CHM), a free-standing, tertiary care, academic children s hospital offering the full spectrum of pediatric and surgical subspecialty services. The PICU at CHM is a 38-bed multidisciplinary unit that cares for >1500 patients/year with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Over 85% of PICU patients have follow-up within the institution. CHM is an American College of Surgeons verified Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center and an American Burn Association verified Burn Center. Additional strengths of WSU include its vast experience with federally-funded multicenter research networks such as the Neonatal Network, Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Intervention, Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials Network, Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network, and the Children s Oncology Group. The concept proposal included in this application builds on prior CPCCRN research, led by Dr. Meert, demonstrating many challenges to achieving high quality parent-clinician communication in PICUs. High quality communication is especially important for parents with low health literacy, a key contributing factor to child health disparities. Patient- and family-centered communication (PFCC) may improve the quality of communication but depends, in part, on parents  active participation (e.g., question asking) during clinical interactions. The objective of the concept proposal is to develop a novel communication intervention, the Question Prompt Toolkit; and determine the extent to which the intervention can enhance PFCC in PICUs, and thus improve child and family outcomes. The central hypothesis is that use of the Question Prompt Toolkit will increase parents  active participation in clinical interactions, knowledge, self-efficacy and trust, reduce parent's  anxiety, and ultimately contribute to better health-related quality of life for the child and reduced family burden, especially for families with low health literacy. The hypothesis will be tested in multicenter research that pursues 2 specific aims: (1) Develop the Question Prompt Toolkit for use among parents of critically-ill children; and (2) Determine the extent to which the Question Prompt Toolkit can enhance the use of PFCC in PICUs and improve child and family outcomes. The proposal is significant because it will contribute a new communication intervention that can be applied in PICU practice to address parents'  communication needs and improve health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The concept proposal is relevant to public health because achieving high quality healthcare communication can help to improve the problem of low health literacy. Low health literacy among parents is a key contributor to racial and ethnic disparities i child health and healthcare. Thus, the concept proposal is relevant to the NIH s mission because eliminating health disparities is a major goal of Healthy People 2020.",Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research

"Mobile Health intervention for rural atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent, morbid condition. Anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic strokes is a foremost priority in AF but adherence is challenging for patients and lapses in anticoagulation are common. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a recognized program to enhance self-efficacy and improve adherence, quality of life, and patient-centered health outcomes. Rural patients with AF experience increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes due to geographic and social isolation, poor health care access, and limited health literacy. We propose an innovative, scalable CDSM intervention to improve anticoagulation adherence in rural patients with AF. This single-center parallel group randomized clinical trial employs an embodied conversational agent (ECA) delivered by smartphone. We have used the ECA – a computer character that simulates face-to-face conversation using voice, hand gesture and gaze cues to provide education, monitoring and problem-solving – to improve health behaviors and outcomes in individuals with limited computer and health literacy. Here, guided by a patient advisory committee, we propose to expand our successful 30-day ECA pilot to develop a novel CDSM program for AF. We combine the ECA with the AliveCor Kardia smartphone heart rate and rhythm monitor. We implement a 4-month CDSM curriculum and assess its sustainability at 8 and 12 months. Our trial randomizes 264 patients with AF who are receiving anticoagulation for stroke prevention to (1) the ECA/Kardia intervention, accompanied by provider alerts for prespecified results; or (2) the control, consisting of an AF educational session and a smartphone with a general health application (WebMD). Our trial leverages the clinical infrastructure of the University of Pittsburgh across western Pennsylvania by recruiting at 7 rural clinics that share a common electronic health record. Our aims are: (1) To assess the effect of the ECA/Kardia intervention on anticoagulant adherence, as determined by the medication possession ratio, electronic pill count, and self-report. (2) To identify the effect of the intervention on health care utilization accounting for costs of the intervention, hospitalizations, emergency visits, and AF- related procedures at 1-year follow up. (3) To determine the effect of the intervention on the patient-centered outcomes of quality of life and symptoms, as measured by the AF Effect on QualiTy of life (AFEQT) measure, specific to AF, and the general Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29 Profile at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months. (4) To examine mechanisms for the effect of the intervention by symptom burden, AF classification, health literacy and intervention use. We will additionally follow the cohort through the study period for exploratory analyses of rurality and outcomes associated with AF. Expected Results: In this project we will evaluate a scalable patient-centered intervention to improve anticoagulation adherence, health care utilization and patient-centered outcomes in vulnerable rural individuals with chronic AF. If proven successful, this intervention can be broadly disseminated to improve the care of patients with AF. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is especially morbid for rural individuals, who experience limited health care access, geographic isolation, low health literacy, and cardiovascular disparities. The proposed research is relevant to public health by promoting chronic disease self-management in order to improve anticoagulant adherence for stroke prevention and patient-reported outcomes for vulnerable rural individuals with AF.",Mobile Health intervention for rural atrial fibrillation,9987710,R01HL143010,"['Accounting ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs

"Community Health Workers and teleaudiology as a culturally-relevant approach to improving access to hearing health care Many rural and under-resourced areas lack audiology services, exacerbating hearing health care disparities. In the United States, hearing loss impacts an estimated 50 million individuals aged 65 years and older. Access to hearing aid rehabilitation can improve health outcomes, yet an uneven geographic distribution of audiologists across the U.S. results in communities that lack services. In teleaudiology, an audiologist delivers care to a patient from a remote workplace via videoconferencing technology, minimizing the barrier of geography. Evidence has demonstrated the clinical equivalence of teleaudiology to face-to-face procedures, including in the area of hearing aid fitting and verification. However, additional barriers to accessibility affecting disparity populations, including socioeconomic and cultural differences, are known to contribute to poor health service utilization. In teleaudiology, a facilitator is located at the patient site to assist with hands-on tasks, under the supervision of the remote audiologist. Community Health Workers may be a feasible patient-site support for teleaudiology due to their established role in health promotion for disparity populations. For decades, Community Health Workers have supported a number of disease-specific (e.g. Diabetes) and general health areas by providing community-receptive health education, patient advocacy, and integrating with patient-care teams. Given their established history of addressing disparities in a vast range of other health areas, Community Health Workers have been identified for their emergent role in reducing disparities in access to hearing health care (Marrone et al., 2017; Marrone, Ingram et al., 2016). The proposed research builds on the Sponsors’ ongoing research with an established Community Health Worker program serving Hispanic/Latino older adults with hearing loss. The proposed study aims to test the feasibility of an innovative approach in which Community Health Workers serve as the patient-site support for teleaudiology. The hypothesis is that providing evidence-based audiology services delivered via teleaudiology with patient-site support from Community Health Workers will lead to improved access to care, and therefore improved hearing health outcomes. In this project, remote hearing aid fittings will be delivered by an audiologist with patient-site support from a Community Health Worker for a cohort of older adults (>65 years) from a rural area that has been identified as under-resourced for hearing health care. Hearing aid benefit will be measured quantitatively via standardized patient-reported outcome measures, and qualitatively via focus groups. We expect hearing aid benefit to be improved at 3 months in an immediate intervention group relative to a waitlist comparison group, and for outcomes to be maintained at 6 months. The proposed research and training plans are supported by a multidisciplinary team of researchers with a longstanding history of collaboration across audiology, public health, telemedicine, and community health. The overall goal aligns with the NIDCD research priority to generate evidence for high-quality, accessible hearing health care in under-resourced areas. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Millions of older Americans face barriers to accessing hearing health care that would otherwise improve health and functioning with hearing loss. Teleaudiology has emerged as a solution for bridging gaps in care, particularly for rural and underresourced populations. Results from this culturally-relevant teleaudiology project will inform future translational research to adapt evidence-based teleaudiology interventions acceptable for diverse populations.

"El Trabajo no te Debe Dañar: Reduction of Hazardous Exposures in Small Businesses through a Community Health Worker Intervention PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to reduce negative health outcomes in small businesses that primarily employ high-risk Latino workers by characterizing their exposures to hazardous chemicals and assessing if a community health worker (CHW) intervention is effective at decreasing these exposures. Although preventable by definition, occupational disease and injuries are leading causes of death in the United States, with a disproportionate burden faced by Latinos. Small businesses pose a particular risk. They are more likely to employ low-wage Latino workers, and often use hazardous solvents including volatile organic chemicals that can cause asthma, cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological disease; yet their workers lack access to culturally and linguistically appropriate occupational health and pollution prevention information due to economic, physical, and social barriers. CHW-led interventions and outreach in Latino communities have documented increased access to health care and health education and reduced workplace exposures among farmworkers. CHWs are an innovative method to bridge the gap between these small business communities and other stakeholders. The proposed project will capitalize on established partnerships between the University of Arizona, the Sonora Environmental Research Institute, Inc. and the El Rio Community Health Center. A community-engaged research framework will be used to complete the following specific aims: 1) quantify and identify exposures to hazardous chemicals in the two high risk small business sectors common in our target area (i.e., auto repair shops and beauty salons); 2) work collaboratively with business owners, trade groups, workers and CHWs to design an industrial hygiene – enhanced CHW intervention tailored for each small business sector; and 3) conduct a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the CHW intervention at reducing workplace exposures to volatile organic compounds and assess which factors led to successful utilization of exposure control strategies in both male and female-dominated businesses. Businesses will be randomized to either an intervention or delayed intervention group, both of which will receive incentives to participate including worksite health screenings. CHWs will work closely with business owners and employees to select and implement exposure-strategies appropriate for their worksite using a menu of complementary strategies of varying complexity and cost. This innovative project has the potential to directly reduce occupational health disparities through a CHW intervention that moves beyond providing occupational health education. The intervention will overcome current barriers by helping marginalized Latino workers and small business owners who may have limited education, literacy, and computer skills to understand the hazards associated with their work, and will empower them to have greater control over their occupational exposures, with the ultimate goal of preventing occupational disease and reducing health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Occupational exposures contribute to minority health disparities. This study will formally evaluate if a community health worker intervention can effectively reduce workplace exposures in marginalized small businesses to hazardous chemicals. Through face-to-face encounters, this study will increase the capacity of workers with limited education, literacy, and computer skills to understand workplace hazards and effective control options to reduce exposures and prevent occupational disease.",El Trabajo no te Debe Dañar: Reduction of Hazardous Exposures in Small Businesses through a Community Health Worker Intervention,9831090,R01ES028250,"['occupational disorder ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' workplace exposure ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Solvents ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Industrial Health ', ' Industrial Hygiene ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Businesses ', ' Information Protection ', ' Latino ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' Workplace ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Individual ', ' occupational health/safety ', ' Exposure to ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Occupational ', ' empowered ', ' hazard ', ' Employee ', ' skills ', ' research study ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' minority health ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' Pollution Prevention ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' volatile organic chemical ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Occupational injury ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' social factors ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Arizona ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Beauty ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Workers ', ' Computers ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Government Programs ', ' Hazardous Chemicals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incentives ', ' Industry ', ' Labor Unions ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' literacy ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Occupational Diseases ', ' occupational disease/disorder ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2020,584737,0.02788269235191267
"Kids SIPsmartER: A multi-level behavioral and health literacy intervention to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages among Appalachian middle-school students Project Summary: The intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB, e.g., soda/pop, sweet tea, sports and energy drinks, fruit drinks) is disproportionately high in Appalachia, including among adolescents whose intake is more than double the national average and more than four times the recommended daily amount. There are strong and consistent scientific data and systematic reviews documenting relationships among high SSB consumption and numerous chronic health conditions such obesity, some types of obesity-related cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dental erosion and decay. Reaching adolescents with behaviorally- focused health programs where they spend the majority of their time, at school, shows promise. However, engaging caregivers who serve as their child’s most influential role model as well as the gatekeeper for the home environment may be equally as important in changing adolescents’ SSB behaviors. Finally, there is a great need to understand how to support schools and teachers to deliver and maintain evidence-based health education programs, especially among rural schools. Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is to work in partnership with Appalachian middle schools to implement and evaluate Kids SIPsmartER. Kids SIPsmartER is a 6-month, school-based, behavior and health literacy curriculum aimed at improving SSB behaviors among middle school students. The program also integrates a two-way short service message (SMS) strategy to engage caregivers in SSB role modeling and supporting home SSB environment changes. Kids SIPsmartER is grounded by the Theory of Planned Behavior as well as health literacy, media literacy, numeracy, and public health literacy concepts. In our proposed cluster-randomized controlled trial, we target 12 middle schools in medically underserved Appalachian counties in southwest Virginia. Our study is guided by the RE-AIM (reach, adoption, effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance) framework and is a type 1 hybrid design. The primary aim is to assess changes in SSB behaviors at 7-months among 7th grade students at schools receiving Kids SIPsmartER, as compared to control schools. We will also evaluate changes in secondary student outcomes (e.g., BMI, quality of life, theory-related variables), changes in caregiver outcomes (e.g., SSB behaviors, home SSB environment), and 19-month maintenance of outcomes. The reach and representativeness of Kids SIPsmartER will be assessed. Furthermore, we will use a mixed-methods approach with interviews, surveys, observation, and process evaluation strategies to determine the degree to which teachers implement Kids SIPsmartER as intended and the potential for institutionalization within the schools. The long-term goal of this health promotion and prevention line of research is to establish an effective, scalable, and sustainable multi-level strategy to improve SSB behaviors and reduce SSB-related health inequities and chronic conditions (e.g. obesity, cancer, type II diabetes, heart disease, dental caries) in rural Appalachia. Project Narrative: Excessive sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) consumption among Appalachian adolescents is well-established and is associated with numerous chronic health conditions (e.g., obesity, some cancers, type II diabetes, heart disease, dental caries). Collaborating with local Appalachian school systems to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-level intervention strategies to reduce SSB consumption among middle- school students and their caregivers has important public health implications. The public health relevance of this prevention and disparities focused research is further signified by our efforts to promote and determine the capacity of partnering school districts to implement and sustain the multi-level SSB reduction intervention.",Kids SIPsmartER: A multi-level behavioral and health literacy intervention to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages among Appalachian middle-school

"Health Literacy Assessment and Intervention to Reduce Disparities: FLIGHT/VIDAS II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is a critically important skill that helps people to become active participants in their health care. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy showed that more than 75 million Americans had basic health literacy skills, indicating that as many as 1 in 4 Americans can have difficulty understanding information about their healthcare. Persons in racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have even lower levels of health literacy. Twenty-four percent of blacks (9.5 million persons) and 41% of Hispanics (21 million persons) have below basic levels of health literacy. These persons have lower levels of health literacy and compelling evidence, including our own findings (see below), link race and ethnicity to disparities in health via health literacy. Members of minority groups and older adults are more frequently affected by chronic diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, asthma, hepatitis C, HIV infection, mental health disorders and many others. The twin burdens of chronic disease and low levels of health literacy thus fall disproportionately on those most in need - members of minorities and older adults, all of whom likely to experience one or more chronic conditions while often not having the health literacy skills to help them cope. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a logical target for a general health literacy intervention. In an approach that cuts across specific diseases. CDSM targets problems and skills needed to cope with issues such as fatigue, pain, stress, depression, sleep disturbance and treatment adherence. Studies show that in- person CDSM classes improve patients' functioning and reduce healthcare utilization, but their availability is limited due to the lack of qualified personnel and cost. Similarly, while interventions have been developed to improve health literacy, they are difficult to scale to levels needed to meet the challenge of low health literacy (for more than 40 million persons) due to their cost. Effective interventions with the potential for wider dissemination at reasonable costs are urgently needed. In a previous study, we showed that a computer-delivered tailored information intervention targeting health literacy that can deployed either as an information kiosk in a clinical office or n the Internet could be cost- effective in improving patients' health literacy and adherence. It is nt clear, however, whether the same sort of computer-delivered, multimedia and interactive approach will be effective in improving CDSM skills in persons with low baseline levels of health literacy, and if it is, whether its effects will extend beyond health literacy to general health, slf-efficacy, activation, and treatment adherence. In this follow-up study we will evaluate this possibility by creating a personally relevant computer-delivered intervention targeting CDSM and health literacy among African-Americans, Hispanics, and white non-Hispanics: PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving patient health literacy through their chronic disease management skills and knowledge may be an effective strategy reducing health disparities. In this project we will build on our work in health literacy and computer-delivered interventions to create a new intervention to reduce health disparities by improving health literacy and chronic

"The Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Communities Worker Health and Safety Training Program Project Summary/Abstract  The Dillard University Deep South Center for Environmental Justice hazardous Waste Worker Training Center provides training to hazardous material and waster workers who may perform jobs covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standards and assist employers with complying with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120. The Consortium’s goal is unique in that its emphasis is on underserved populations in both its Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program (HWWTP) and its Environmental Careers Worker Training Program (ECWTP).  The proposed HWWTP component has been designed to provide model occupational safety and health training for workers who are or may be engaged in activities related to hazardous waste removal, containment or chemical response. The emphasis however, is on servicing workers of entities where health and safety training is critical to the worker’s wellbeing and possibly the safety and health of the public, but due to circumstances beyond the individual worker’s control, (s)he is unlikely to receive sufficient training at either the quality or quantity needed to ensure safety and health. Such entities include emergency responders and city workers in small municipalities and or cities where budgeting restraints or working conditions (such as no release time), greatly reduces or eliminates the possibility of training. Volunteer fire departments and small county police forces, city health department employees, port authority workers and mosquito control division employees are examples of workers the Consortium has trained. Additionally, HBCUs with smaller budgets have been shown to receive some of the highest fines for non-compliance with applicable regulations. Small minority and disadvantaged businesses typically lack the capital to participate in high cost compliance training programs. The Consortium has targeted these entities for the proposed HWWT program.  The proposed ECWTP component has been designed to deliver comprehensive worker training to increase the number of underrepresented and disadvantaged minority adults employed in the fields of environmental restoration, hazardous materials and construction. The goals for this program are: (1) to serve underrepresented and disadvantaged adults living near hazardous waste and or contaminated property at risk of exposure to ambient hazards; and also (2) to provide additional pre-employment services that are inclusive of basic skills (i.e. study skills, math, reading, life skills) to increase program retention and completion; and (3) to successfully place trainers in jobs in the environmental restoration and construction fields. The added value of this training is not just that it increases sustainable employment opportunities for residents of beleaguered communities engulfed in situations of poverty and pollution, but that by investing in these particular individuals promotes economic stability, addresses health disparities and advances environmental justice. Project Narrative The HBCU and Communities Consortium Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program is uniquely designed to reach populations for training that have historically, due to poverty and or racism, been disenfranchised and excluded from opportunities existing within society. It also addresses basic inequities in resources for different communities across the country (rural vs urban) and differences in priorities for municipalities and city agencies, with training being first to be cut. Additionally, the Consortium is unique in its make-up in that it includes Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Community Based Organizations (CBOs),that by design, serve the selected target population.",The Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Communities Worker Health and Safety Training Program,10223474,U45ES010664,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Asbestos ', ' Budgets ', ' Capital ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Workers ', ' Containment ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disasters ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Fires ', ' fire ', ' Goals ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' HAZMAT ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' haz mat ', ' Hazardous Waste ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Industry ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mining ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mosquito Control ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Sector ', ' Reading ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Societies ', ' sound ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration ', ' Occupational Safety and Health Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Occupational Safety ', ' Businesses ', ' Police Forces ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Hazardous Waste Sites ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' racism ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Heat Stress ', ' Heat Stress Syndromes ', ' heat-related illness ', ' Heat Stress Disorders ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' restraint ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Molds ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Hour ', ' restoration ', ' Country ', ' non-compliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' non-compliance ', ' Services ', ' hazard ', ' authority ', ' Employee ', ' Municipalities ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' skills ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' safety education ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' emergency personnel ', ' emergency responder ', ' emergency service personnel ', ' emergency service responder ', ' cost ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' remediation ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' chemical release ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' volunteer ', ' gulf coast ', ' health training ', ' environmental justice ', ' Emergency response ', ' climate impact ', ' Study Skills ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority student ', ' minority communities ', ' first responder ', ' HAZWOPER ', ' Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response ', ' ']",NIEHS,"DEEP SOUTH CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE, INC.",U45,2020,150000,0.049632996012657846
"Improving Routine Asymptomatic Cancer Screening among Federally Qualified Health Center Users in Florida: Application of a Health Literacy Framework ABSTRACT As a recently appointed tenure-track Assistant Professor of Public Health, my long-term career goal is to make a meaningful contribution to the elimination of cancer disparities. In doing this, I wish to establish myself as a nationally-recognized independent investigator with expertise in the use of health communication to address cancer disparities. I have substantial training in behavioral research, primarily focused on understanding the role of various social and cultural factors on cancer disparities. Building on this foundation, I require additional training to fill gaps related to the design, implementation, and evaluation of health communication interventions. My Mentorship Team and I have prepared a comprehensive career development plan that consists of mentorship, coursework, expert consultations, workshops, experiential learning, and an innovative research project. My proposed research plan aligns with my overarching career goal in seeking to improve routine cancer screening within federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), where the burden of cancer is greater compared to the general population, but screening rates are much lower than national averages. Despite the significant contribution of routine screening in the reduction of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, disparities persist among racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic (SES) populations who continue to underutilize screening. FQHCs can be invaluable partners in reducing these disparities due to their sliding-fee pay structure and location in medically underserved areas. The goal of the proposed K01 research project is to understand how current FQHC users perceive routine asymptomatic cancer screening, and develop and pre- test an eHealth tool that promotes screening among FQHC users. The specific aims are to: (1) Conduct formative research with FQHC users to understand how they perceive and make decisions about routine asymptomatic cancer screening; (2) Design and pre-test an eHealth tool that addresses each domain of the health literacy framework, and incorporates key decision criteria of asymptomatic cancer screening among FQHC users; and (3) Pilot test an eHealth intervention within an FQHC setting aimed at delivering literacy appropriate, “decision- relevant” information about routine asymptomatic cancer screening to FQHC users. This Mentored Research Award would provide the necessary protected time to achieve the following training goals: (1) Develop expertise in the application of decision analysis to health communication, within a health literacy framework; (2) Become familiar with clinic operations, user profiles, and service delivery within FQHCs, along with successful research collaboration with FQHCs; (3) Build competence in health communication intervention design, implementation, and evaluation; and (4) Develop the necessary skills to translate communication research into practice, specifically within an FQHC setting. This research would set the stage for a larger R01-level health communication intervention study. Findings might inform not only cancer screening, but also other health promotion interventions in FQHCs, which are increasingly becoming medical homes for low SES populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The long-term goal of this research is to increase routine asymptomatic screening rates for breast, cervical and CRC among low income, uninsured, low socioeconomic (SES) populations, ultimately reducing cancer disparities. The proposed study will address the gap in our understanding of how current FQHC users perceive routine asymptomatic cancer screening; and be the first to apply ethnographic decision tree modeling within a health literacy framework to address the complex cancer decision-making processes of uninsured and low SES populations.",Improving Routine Asymptomatic Cancer Screening among Federally

"Work Conditions and the Health of Working Parents and their Children Project Summary (max 30 lines text)  Individuals’ work conditions are strongly related to their health. Parents’ work conditions can also affect the health and development of their children, who are greatly influenced and constrained by their parents’ lived experiences in the labor market. Work schedules are a particularly underexplored aspect of work conditions, with the potential to shape worker and family health. The importance of understanding scheduling’s effects continues to increase as low-wage employment shifts toward the service sector, with its characteristic variability and unpredictability in work and pay.  Prior research has shown that work schedule unpredictability is common among low- wage workers and that it is associated with worse worker and family well-being. Despite this emerging body of evidence, however, there remain a number of unknowns. First, although schedule unpredictability correlates to worse outcomes for workers and families, it is unclear from the extant literature whether schedule unpredictability causes worse outcomes or whether the associations merely reflect differences between workers in other characteristics that predict both schedule unpredictability and worker well-being. Second, while policies regulating work often connect rhetorically to community-level population health, laws aimed at curbing schedule unpredictability for low-wage service workers are very new and little is known about the health effects, intended or unintended, of such legislation.  The proposed research project will address these gaps in the literature by using an innovative daily diary methodology to gather daily reports from 1,000 low-wage working parents about work schedule unpredictability, pay, and worker and family mental health. Daily reports will be gathered over two one-month periods, once prior to a schedule stability law taking effect and once after the law is implemented. We utilize a unique daily survey tool that our research team created and extensively piloted. No other researchers examining work conditions and family health are utilizing this type of data collection method.  Because our design combines a daily diary study with the implementation of a policy change, we can both examine the causal within-family effect of daily unpredictability on worker and family health and also identify causal effects of regulation that changes work conditions. Studies of work conditions and worker health typically rely on between-person survey approaches. Our design effectively utilizes within-person change over time both day-to-day and between periods to investigate the causal effect of work schedule unpredictability on health. Project Narrative (3 sentences max) Work conditions are strongly related to the health of both workers and their families, yet work schedules have been severely underexplored as a potentially health-impacting aspect of individuals’ work conditions. The proposed study will address this gap by utilizing an innovative daily diary methodology with family fixed effects, combined with a difference-in-difference framework, to investigate the effects of unpredictable work schedules on the mental and behavioral health of working parents and their children.",Work Conditions and the Health of Working Parents and their Children,9875089,R21HD100893,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Elements ', ' Employment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Laws ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Schedule ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Respondent ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' diaries ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' family structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' behavioral health ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' population health ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' ']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,267906,0.05637934344557453
"Breast Cancer Screening: Priorities and Attitudes of Diverse Women Under 50 PROJECT SUMMARY Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death and the leading cause of premature mortality for women in the U.S. Women who are racial/ethnic minorities experience an unequal burden of the disease. Breast cancer screening mammography guidelines for women aged 40-49 years are controversial. The potential benefit of avoiding an advanced cancer is often emphasized, while minimizing the frequency of possible harms. Conflicting recommendations for age at initiation and frequency of screening mammography for women aged 40-49 years highlight concerns related to the benefits and harms of screening. These conflicting recommendations leave women confused about when to initiate screening, how often to be screened, what sources to trust, and can undermine informed decision-making about screening mammography. Women from diverse racial/ethnic groups and those with limited health literacy are particularly vulnerable to misunderstanding screening recommendations. Health literacy is the degree to which one has the ability to obtain, process, understand, and use health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions. Those with limited health literacy have difficulty navigating the health care system, making health care decisions, and utilizing cancer screening, all contributing to disparities in cancer care. Health literacy is often a more powerful predictor of health disparities than more well-established predictors such as education and race/ethnicity. Moreover, individuals from traditionally medically underserved communities (e.g., racial/ethnic minority, low socioeconomic status [SES]) are at higher risk for lower health literacy, which can also reduce participation in cancer screening. This project will compare the intersections and differences between how Latina, Black, and non-Latina White women consider the benefits and harms associated with breast cancer screening mammography. The goal of this project is to create decision support tools for Latina, Black, and non-Latina White women with varying levels of health literacy under age 50 considering breast cancer screening mammography.

"American Samoa Indigenous Samoan Partnership to Initiate REsearch Excellence (INSPIRE) in Colorectal Cancer Health Literacy Project Abstract Very little information regarding the health status of American Samoans are available, and the research infrastructure in America Samoa (AS) requires a sufficient foundation and capacity building to conduct large-scale population health research. The purpose of this project is to: (1) build the research capacity in America Samoa to conduct population health research, and (2) to support a pilot health research project that aims to increase colorectal cancer screening literacy among American Samoans so that initial data will be available and serve as the foundation for future research efforts in America Samoa. This project is a collaborative community and research engaged effort that reflects the community-identified priorities in AS addressing a research gaps in health promotion and cancer prevention. The percentage of American Samoan adults aged 50-75 obtaining CRC screening is far below the US national average, i.e., 7% of American Samoans vs. 58.2% of US adults. Assessment of health literacy levels has been recommended in specific populations and to use assessment results in developing targeted and tailored promotional programs. The proposed Indigenous Samoan Program to Initiate Research Excellence (INSPIRE) – CRC Literacy. (INSPIRE) aims to: (1) strengthen research capacity by providing technical assistance on research protocol, IRB training, and development of an easily accessed cancer data repository, (2) adapt/pilot the Short form Test of Functional Health Literacy – Adults (STOFHLA) and administer revision to a representative sample of older adults recruited through Respondent Driven Sampling methods, and (3) informed by STOFHLA results, develop and implement a culturally competent, linguistically appropriate, and theory-informed screening intervention, use of a 2 group pre-post control group comparison, with measurement of Knowledge-Attitude- Behavior (KAB) survey at several points of evaluation and assessment of the primary outcome namely, timely completion of Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT). INSPIRE efforts will be led by the AS Community Cancer Coalition in partnership with LBJ Tropical Medical Center (LBJTMC), the AS Department of Health and dedicated technical assistance from consultants associated with the University of Hawai`i and Azusa Pacific University in California, with consultant expertise in health literacy, RDS, cancer screening research, STOFHLA, community-based participatory approaches, multi-modal research/evaluation strategies, and history of positive collaboration with AS partners. This effort should result in increased screening use and contribute to building a foundation for future translational research. INSPIRE-produced research is significant for AS because it lays a much needed foundation for systematic public health research. Further, INSPIRE research will contribute to advancement in the science of health literacy and health promotions with/for resource-poor, yet tradition-rich Indigenous communities thereby, offering the hopeful prospect of eliminating socially-constructed and harmful health inequalities.

"Using Community-Engaged Methods to Design a Tool to Promote Informed Breast Cancer Screening Decisions for Low Literacy Women PROJECT SUMMARY Low health literacy (LHL) is increasingly recognized as an important driver of cancer disparities, and given that one in five Americans lack the necessary literacy skills to function adequately in our health care system, this is a burgeoning public health crisis. Adults with LHL are less likely to use preventive services, less likely to undergo cancer screening, and have higher mortality. Mammography screening decisions, which increasingly call for shared-decision making between patient and physician, is an exemplar of where communication challenges are most likely to affect outcomes for LHL populations. Informed decisions for breast cancer screening that account for individual risk of developing breast cancer and patient preferences are recommended by professional guidelines for women aged 40-54 for whom the harms of screening can exceed the benefits. While mammography screening is estimated to reduce breast cancer mortality by 15% for women in their 40s, screening in younger women has high rates of false positives (40-60% over ten years) and substantial estimates of over-diagnosis (15-48% of those screened). Data consistently show that communication about mammography screening inadequately prepares women for these outcomes and there are widespread misperceptions about mammography and its utility among women making screening decisions. While literacy is a known barrier to receiving mammography, there are currently no decision tools to help women with LHL with their decision-making. Therefore, the goal of this training and research program is to develop the necessary knowledge and skills to create and test a novel decision aid to increase informed breast cancer screening decisions for women ages 40-54 with LHL. Training will cover four essential domains: 1) Community-Engaged Research Methods; 2) Tools to Improve Informed Decision-Making; 3) Low Literacy Populations; and 4) Patient-Centered Outcome Assessment. The knowledge gained through didactic training and one-on-one mentoring will support three proposed Research Aims. First, I will engage multiple stakeholders, including women with LHL (n=25) and their clinicians (n=20), in qualitative interviews to understand and characterize their decisional preferences and identify outcomes that matter most. Second, I will construct a multi-media decision aid appropriate for use with women with LHL ages 40-54. An expert panel (n=10) will assist in evaluating the acceptability of evidence based content for inclusion, and women with LHL will provide input on tool acceptability and pilot outcomes via cognitive interviews and a survey (n=30). Third, I aim to assess the impact of the decision aid on decision-making outcomes (decisional conflict, knowledge, shared decision-making) and screening intentions through a pilot pre-test/post-test study among 50 women and their primary care providers. This work will launch my career as an independent investigator trained to design and disseminate patient-centered decision supports that help to optimize the delivery of cancer screening services for those with LHL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Literacy is a critical aspect of disparities research, and is particularly salient when aiming to support and improve decision-making in health care. This research will develop and test a multi-media decision aid for breast cancer screening with an explicit focus on the needs of women with low health literacy using community engaged methods, thus enhancing its translational potential. It will provide novel data on individual experiences with informed decision-making and the effects of a decision aid on patient-centered outcomes among a low health literacy population.",Using Community-Engaged Methods to Design a Tool to Promote Informed Breast Cancer Screening Decisions for Low Literacy Women,9981682,K07CA221899,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' literacy ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Suggestion ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Decision Aid ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Address ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Low Literacy Population ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' investigator training ', ' informant ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' shared decision making ', ' adolescent woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' young woman ', ' screening ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' mammography screening ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Information Literacy ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' screening disparities ', ' cognitive interview ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' screening guidelines ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,K07,2020,128408,-0.027143104511673594
"Hablame Bebe: Improving health information access for low-income Hispanic children's early language environments PROJECT SUMMARY  Hispanic infants whose families live in poverty are at a significantly elevated risk of poorer cognitive development and academic achievement. Research shows that this is explained in part by their early language environment: children from lower socioeconomic status (SES) homes often experience less high-quality language input than children from higher SES homes, which in turn may lead to delays or gaps in later language skills. Unfortunately, these circumstances can be worse for Hispanic children whose immigrant caregivers believe that they should switch from Spanish to English as a result of assimilation pressure or misinformed advice. Additionally, Hispanics parents are more than twice as likely to have low health literacy and significantly less likely to attend well-child care check-ups.  In response to this disparity, our interdisciplinary team created Háblame Bebé, the first mobile phone application that reduces the word gap and promotes Spanish-English bilingualism for low-income Hispanic children. In 2017, Háblame Bebé was selected as the winner of the U.S. HRSA Bridging the Word Gap Challenge. For this Challenge, we developed two prototypes and tested them with 32 low-income Hispanic families. In this study, we learned that although our app was effective in improving overall outcomes for children, parents who had experienced linguistic racism were not as likely to give “Language Nutrition” to their babies in their native Spanish. Only after we created a sociolinguistic pride component in the app did it lead to caregivers providing significantly more “Language Nutrition” to their children.  Based on our team’s research on the impact of Háblame Bebé, we need to make additions to the app in order to maximize outreach and effectiveness for low-income, low-literacy Hispanic caregivers. The proposed project seeks to serve this high-risk group by developing, disseminating, and evaluating health information pertaining to early developmental milestones and language environments for low- income Hispanic families. We have partnered with a health sciences librarian as well as the Miami-Dade County Public Library System, and together, will do this by: (Aim 1) improving the deliverability, usability, and understandability of early child development information to low-SES Hispanic families; (Aim 2) developing additional educational content targeting low health literacy and cultural representation; and (Aim 3) assessing the effectiveness of the Háblame Bebé phone app using quantitative and qualitative analyses.  Our goal is to design the most impactful evidence-based app intervention to eliminate the word gap in low-income Hispanic children in the United States and to deliver better, culturally relevant, and usable health information to low-income Hispanic families to reduce disparities in their children. The new content developed will assist in making the Háblame Bebé phone app ready for clinical trial testing upon conclusion of the project. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop, disseminate, and evaluate health information pertaining to early developmental milestones and language environments for low-income Hispanic children via the parent coaching phone app, Háblame Bebé, winner of the HRSA Bridging the Word Gap Challenge. Háblame Bebé teaches low-income Hispanic caregivers how to enhance their “Language Nutrition,” thereby increasing Spanish-English bilingualism in their children, which has shown to positively impact children’s educational success and long-term health outcomes. We will partner with library specialists to improve the efficacy of the app for low-income, low- health literacy Hispanic parents by 1) improving the deliverability, usability, and understandability of early child development information to low-SES Hispanic families; 2) creating new educational content that targets low health literacy and cultural representation; and 3) assessing the effectiveness and acceptance of the app via quantitative and qualitative analyses.",Hablame Bebe: Improving health information access for low-income Hispanic children's early language environments,9982425,G08LM013183,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Health Science Library ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' literacy ', ' nutrition ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' pressure ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' County ', ' Librarians ', ' Walking ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Assimilations ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' racism ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' cooking ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' sociolinguistics ', ' success ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' Toddler ', ' outreach ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Early identification ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' kindergarten ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' language processing ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' Education Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Learning Module ', ' cognitive development ', ' curriculum development ', ' social media ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' nonnative ', ' non-Native ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' early adversity ', ' early childhood adversity ', ' early life adversity ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NLM,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,G08,2020,154235,0.06051455191329971
