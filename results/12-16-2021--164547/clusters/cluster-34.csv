"Minority Pre-doctoral Education to Reduce Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NCI's Plans and Priorities for Cancer Research identifies training of new cancer scientists as one of its ""most important challenges,"" and emphasizes the need for increased involvement of racial and ethnic minorities in cancer research careers.  Increasing minority participation in research careers has also been a major priority in public health, an interdisciplinary field whose contributions to cancer prevention and control have been significant, and largely unique.  Because a more diverse public health work force can better understand and serve the needs of diverse  communities, well-trained minority public health researchers are needed to ensure improvements are made in eliminating health and cancer disparities.  We propose a two-year pre-doctoral education program to prepare African American graduate students in public health to help eliminate cancer disparities through cancer prevention and control research.  The program consists of five main elements.  For students: (1) special coursework in understanding and eliminating cancer disparities; (2) mentored experiential learning in cancer prevention and control research and policy; (3) mentored independent research; and, (4) professional network-building with an interdisciplinary group of African American scholars from a national pool of researchers whose work addresses cancer and/or disparities.  For faculty: (5) skill building in cross-cultural mentoring.  To enhance future adoption of the program by other institutions, these program components will be designed for dissemination and the proposal identifies specific products and mechanisms for distribution.  The School of Public Health and Graduate School at Saint Louis University are strongly committed to this program, and have pledged 85% tuition scholarships for students involved.          ",Minority Pre-doctoral Education to Reduce Disparities,6677680,R25CA102628,"['health education ', ' postgraduate education ', ' public health ', ' health science profession ', ' health science research support ', ' health science research potential ', ' information dissemination ', ' cancer prevention ', ' handbook ', ' African American ', ' culture ', ' health care policy ', ' clinical research ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY,R25,2003,311246,-0.025307738273264227

Our PRC staff have long-term collaborative relationships with parmers in these communities. The; socioenvironmental context of this region makes it a unique area in which to address significant health disparities in community based participatory research (CBPR). This PRC focuses on CBPR intervention research. Its health priorities are health disparities, primarily diabetes, with a focus also on its precursors and co-morbidity (namely obesity, depression, nutrition, and physical activity), in these communities. These are based on regional and local needs assessments and on local, regional and national health statistics (especially those related to Hispanics). They were chosen in collaboration with our Regional and Local Community Advisory Boards (CABs) and community members, and health departments. This research is conducted within the framework of the PRC national and local logic models and within the conceptual framework of behavioral and environmental change, including the ""change agents change"" approach and the fostering of community capacity-social capital. The program focuses on making changes in physical activity and diet in patients (N=300-400), their families (N= 150-200 families @ 2.5 participants), and in community groups (N=300 - 500), and environmental and policy changes targeting these behaviors. Biological, anthropometric, and behavioral changes are tested as intermediate outcomes.

"Racial Segregation & Disparities in Cancer Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Cancer of the lung, colon, prostate and breast are the most common cancers in the United States. For each of these common cancers, there is evidence of persistent racial and ethnic disparities in stage at diagnosis, the use of cancer treatments, and/or mortality. Prior work examining cancer disparities has focused on individual characteristics, and has not fully explained the causes of cancer disparities. A growing literature suggests that the attributes of the place where an individual resides may be associated with health outcomes independent of individual characteristics. Residential segregation is one of the characteristics of the social environment that is likely to influence disparities in cancer treatments and outcomes. Segregation may be associated with the use of cancer treatments and outcomes through differences in access to care, the characteristics of providers and facilities where an individual seeks care, beliefs about medical treatments, exposure to stress, social support, socioeconomic deprivation, and access to goods and services. The Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization will be used as the conceptual framework for our hypotheses.  Data from SEER and Medicare will be used to obtain individual demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes for individuals diagnosed with lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancer. This individual-level data will be linked with area-level data about residential segregation. We will determine whether segregation is associated with cancer outcomes overall, and specifically for individuals who are white, African American or Hispanic. Additional data about the characteristics of the social and physical environment will be examined as potential mediators of the association between segregation and cancer outcomes. To examine the effects of segregation on disparities in cancer outcomes, regression models will account for the multi-level structure of the data. The proposed study would provide empirical evidence that could give impetus to area-based interventions to reduce cancer disparities.

"Minority Pre-doctoral Education to Reduce Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NCI's Plans and Priorities for Cancer Research identifies training of new cancer scientists as one of its ""most important challenges,"" and emphasizes the need for increased involvement of racial and ethnic minorities in cancer research careers.  Increasing minority participation in research careers has also been a major priority in public health, an interdisciplinary field whose contributions to cancer prevention and control have been significant, and largely unique.  Because a more diverse public health work force can better understand and serve the needs of diverse  communities, well-trained minority public health researchers are needed to ensure improvements are made in eliminating health and cancer disparities.  We propose a two-year pre-doctoral education program to prepare African American graduate students in public health to help eliminate cancer disparities through cancer prevention and control research.  The program consists of five main elements.  For students: (1) special coursework in understanding and eliminating cancer disparities; (2) mentored experiential learning in cancer prevention and control research and policy; (3) mentored independent research; and, (4) professional network-building with an interdisciplinary group of African American scholars from a national pool of researchers whose work addresses cancer and/or disparities.  For faculty: (5) skill building in cross-cultural mentoring.  To enhance future adoption of the program by other institutions, these program components will be designed for dissemination and the proposal identifies specific products and mechanisms for distribution.  The School of Public Health and Graduate School at Saint Louis University are strongly committed to this program, and have pledged 85% tuition scholarships for students involved.          ",Minority Pre-doctoral Education to Reduce Disparities,6928663,R25CA102628,"['health education ', ' postgraduate education ', ' public health ', ' health science profession ', ' health science research support ', ' health science research potential ', ' information dissemination ', ' cancer prevention ', ' handbook ', ' African American ', ' culture ', ' health care policy ', ' clinical research ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY,R25,2005,321187,-0.025307738273264227

"Carolina Community Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Four in every ten North Carolinians will develop cancer during their lives.  It is evident that cancer is a major health concern as well as major health disparity, not only with regards to gender and racial differences but geographically as well.  The Carolina Community Network (CCN) has set as its mission to reduce prostate, breast and colorectal cancer disparities among adult African Americans by leveraging longstanding university-community relationships and the community-based participatory research expertise at UNC to enhance and extend cancer education and research, research training, and cancer health policy in both secular and faith-based communities.  Specifically, the CCN will:  educate both researchers and community members about cancer health disparities and methods of ameliorating them; train a cadre of academic and community researchers to implement and disseminate best cancer prevention and intervention practices; conduct community based participatory research; change treatment and care-seeking patterns for residents of the communities and identify areas for the development or modification of health policy in the area of cancer prevention and treatment to ultimately eliminate cancer health disparities in North Carolina.  The Carolina Community Network will form a pipeline of cancer education and cancer research projects that will be tailored and piloted in both secular and faith based community settings.  The long term goals of the CCN are to:  1) improve utilization of beneficial cancer interventions; 2) increase the number of minorities in clinical trials and other forms of research; 3) strengthen the community's knowledge of cancer disparities and treatment; and 4) impact cancer prevention and control policies.  The Carolina Community Network is well positioned to address these cancer health disparities because of the depth and breadth of the community-based participatory research expertise at UNC, the availability of contrasting faith-based and secular community partners, and the established ties to community groups.         ",Carolina Community Network,6925253,U01CA114629,"['cooperative study ', ' neoplasm /cancer education ', ' community health service ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' colorectal neoplasm ', ' breast neoplasm ', ' prostate neoplasm ', ' cancer prevention ', ' African American ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2005,738913,0.04494081917945159

"ATECAR: Asian Training, Education on Cancer & Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Asian Americans represent the fastest growing ethnic group in the US.  In PA and NJ, the increase was 75 percent, comprising nearly 12 percent of PA's and more than 8 percent of NJ's populations.  In NY, Asians comprise 6.2 percent of the state's population.  A large subset of this multicultural population is poorly educated, medically uninsured and severely underserved.  As a group, Asians suffer inordinately high rates of cervical, breast, stomach, prostate, colorectal and hepatitis-B-related liver cancers.  While high rates of smoking contribute substantially to elevated rates of lung, esophageal and laryngeal cancers among males, the pervasiveness of secondhand smoke in Asian homes contributes significantly to high rates of these cancers among nonsmoker family members who share the same dwelling.  Specifically, both Asian American men and women have higher incidence and mortality rates of liver cancer than other ethnic groups in the U.S. Lung cancer remains a leading cause of death for Asian males and females and is highest among Vietnamese.  Mortality rates for breast cancer are high among Chinese women.  Vietnamese women have the highest rates of cervical cancer among ethnic groups in the US.  The cancer health disparity gap between Asians and mainstream populations is well documented, requiring a robust and vigorous intervention to ameliorate.  This proposal addresses four major ethnic groups residing in the eastern region of the US:  Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese and Cambodians, of whom more than 60 percent are recent immigrants.  The proposal goals and objectives are based on 5-years of ATECAR-SPN experience with Asian communities in this region and are supported by an elaborate system of experienced community-based partners, academic and research institutions and facilities, bilingual and multi-ethnic professional researchers and trainers and an extensive record of research publications on a range of cancer health disparity issues.  The primary goal of the proposed project is to establish a wider ATECAR Community Network (CN) and will work collaboratively to reduce cancer health disparities through innovative education, research and training strategies.  To accomplish this goal, we will undertake three aims in three phases.  Under Aim I, we plan to maintain and increase capacity building to support community-based participatory education, research, and training to reduce cancer health disparities in the Asian American populations (5 major objectives and 11 sub-objectives are proposed); Aim II, develop and implement community-based participatory research and training programs to reduce cancer health disparities in Asian American populations (3 major objectives and 11 sub-objectives are proposed); and Aim III, establish credibility and sustainability of ATECAR CN programs that reduce cancer health disparities (3 major objectives and 2 sub-objectives are proposed)         ","ATECAR: Asian Training, Education on Cancer & Research",6923122,U01CA114582,"['cooperative study ', ' training aid ', ' neoplasm /cancer education ', ' health science research ', ' human subject ', ' multilingualism ', ' liver neoplasm ', ' lung neoplasm ', ' Asian American ', ' Chinese American ', ' culture ', ' clinical research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,U01,2005,801543,0.0745597675852389

"Hispanic Community Network to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hispanics are among the fastest growing population in the United States (US).   Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take advantage of cancer prevention activities than their non-Hispanic White counterparts.  Major concerns related to such under use are low socioeconomic status, lack of insurance, cultural values and norms, treatment options, and knowledge and beliefs concerning cancer.  Further, the Hispanic population as a whole has few mentors and researchers of Hispanic ethnicity to provide culturally appropriate role models for Hispanics to enter cancer research fields.  The overall goal of this proposed five year project is to work with community partners to reduce the cancer health disparities experienced by many Hispanics in a rural area.  We propose to build a Network, or infrastructure of community partners in the Yakima Valley.  With the partners we will promote cancer awareness and education in the Valley, establish a system to recruit minority students to work on cancer prevention projects, develop pilot research projects to address specific cancer disparities in the Valley, develop community research projects to increase cancer education among Hispanics, evaluate the success of the research projects, evaluate the intermediate effects of reducing cancer disparities, and sustain the Network by applying for at least one full-scale trial.   Each of the specific aims is targeted to occur in the three required phases of research.  Phase 1, mobilizing the community, will occur in the first year of the project and will continue throughout the remaining years as new partners join the collaboration and new tasks are selected for intervention.  We expect Phase 2, awareness and education activities, training activities, and pilot research projects to continue from years 02 through 05.  The last phase, Phase 3 will occur in Year 05 as we attempt to obtain independent funding to continue the work in the Valley.

The Research Core (RC) will support basic translational research with the final goal to develop interventions to modulate the ""augmented state of cellular oxidative stress"" (ASCOS) triggered by dietary fat, a risk factor that is seriously affecting minority populations. Studies on breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer, diabetes, and stroke will be focused on elucidating how the development of these diseases is mediated through ASCOS-associated signaling pathways. The RC will also support research projects to understand elements of cultural competence and health care access associated with these conditions. The Research Training and Educational Core (RTEC) will integrate current health disparity training programs with the CHDR's initiative to widen the pipeline to high school & undergraduate students in health disparities research. The Community Outreach and Community Partnerships Core (COCPC) will expand existing programs with key community and government entities in the Inland Empire. The LLUCHDR will serve as a major resource for the whole region that will help researchers work with community stakeholders to reduce or eliminate health disparities in the IE and the country.          ",Loma Linda University Center for Health Disparities Res*,7127662,P20MD001632,"['minority institution research support ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY,P20,2006,1781553,0.0001466528574508206
"Southwest Center for Community Health Promotion The Arizona PRC, the Southwest Center for Community Health Promotion (SWCCHP), is the only PRC that works primarily along the U.S.-Mexico border and that focuses on underserved, multi-ethnic communities. Our PRC staff have long-term collaborative relationships with parmers in these communities. The; socioenvironmental context of this region makes it a unique area in which to address significant health disparities in community based participatory research (CBPR). This PRC focuses on CBPR intervention research. Its health priorities are health disparities, primarily diabetes, with a focus also on its precursors and co-morbidity (namely obesity, depression, nutrition, and physical activity), in these communities. These are based on regional and local needs assessments and on local, regional and national health statistics (especially those related to Hispanics). They were chosen in collaboration with our Regional and Local Community Advisory Boards (CABs) and community members, and health departments. This research is conducted within the framework of the PRC national and local logic models and within the conceptual framework of behavioral and environmental change, including the ""change agents change"" approach and the fostering of community capacity-social capital. The program focuses on making changes in physical activity and diet in patients (N=300-400), their families (N= 150-200 families @ 2.5 participants), and in community groups (N=300 - 500), and environmental and policy changes targeting these behaviors. Biological, anthropometric, and behavioral changes are tested as intermediate outcomes. Thus, during the next five years, the PRC in collaboration with its CABs and community partners will conduct and evaluate this CBPR, implement and evaluate the impact of participatory community coalitions and our local and regional CABs on policy change and the sustainability of behavioral interventions, and develop, implement, and evaluate methods to enhance the scope and impact of community health workers (CHWs) through chronic disease prevention and control activities and advocacy, analyzes results and disseminates the successful intervention components. Further, the PRC will engage in training and education primarily of CHWs and community members.

"Cancer Disparities in Context: Engaging Communities in Monitoring and Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In our pilot project, we propose to produce detailed community and neighborhood maps of cancer disparities as part of a community-based participatory research process involving the Massachusetts Community Network to Eliminate Cancer Disparities through Training, Research and Education (MASS CONECT). Our project addresses two key goals of ""NCI Competitive Supplements for Pilot Projects for Community Networks Program to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities"" (RFA-CA-06-504): (1) to provide preliminary data and results for future research projects; and (2) to involve partnerships of community-based and research organizations in community-based participatory research to reduce disparities. We focus on maps because they provide a powerful and intuitive tool for communicating and contextualizing cancer disparities across communities. By supplementing cancer registry data with socioeconomic data, using the methods of our Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project, we will be able to create novel maps showing links between racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic inequalities in cancer incidence and mortality, in relation to areas defined by public health agencies and the communities themselves. Working with community partners in the three MASS CONECT communities (Boston, Lawrence, and Worcester), we will: (1) convene discussions with community partners to develop a collaborative, community-based participatory research agenda around social disparities in cancer incidence and mortality; (2) compile the population data set, by geocoding 2000- 2005 Massachusetts cancer incidence and mortality data and linking them to 2000 census tract poverty data and population denominators; (3) generate smoothed age-standardized cancer incidence and mortality rates for: (a) Boston, Lawrence, Worcester, and Massachusetts, and (b) community-defined neighborhoods within each city; (4) test the hypothesis that economic deprivation contributes to cancer disparities affecting the city neighborhoods; (5) generate maps showing links between these areas' cancer rates and poverty, and (6) work with our community partners to ensure they can accurately interpret, present, and disseminate the maps to their constituents and in their related public health work. By conducting this research, our project will contribute to the infrastructure, methods, and knowledge communities need to monitor, map, analyze, and address cancer disparities, thereby addressing key objectives of RFA-CA-06-504.          ",Cancer Disparities in Context: Engaging Communities in Monitoring and Mapping,7227348,U01CA114644,[''],NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,U01,2006,70778,0.009565490781514476
"Hispanic Community Network to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hispanics are among the fastest growing population in the United States (US).   Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take advantage of cancer prevention activities than their non-Hispanic White counterparts.  Major concerns related to such under use are low socioeconomic status, lack of insurance, cultural values and norms, treatment options, and knowledge and beliefs concerning cancer.  Further, the Hispanic population as a whole has few mentors and researchers of Hispanic ethnicity to provide culturally appropriate role models for Hispanics to enter cancer research fields.  The overall goal of this proposed five year project is to work with community partners to reduce the cancer health disparities experienced by many Hispanics in a rural area.  We propose to build a Network, or infrastructure of community partners in the Yakima Valley.  With the partners we will promote cancer awareness and education in the Valley, establish a system to recruit minority students to work on cancer prevention projects, develop pilot research projects to address specific cancer disparities in the Valley, develop community research projects to increase cancer education among Hispanics, evaluate the success of the research projects, evaluate the intermediate effects of reducing cancer disparities, and sustain the Network by applying for at least one full-scale trial.   Each of the specific aims is targeted to occur in the three required phases of research.  Phase 1, mobilizing the community, will occur in the first year of the project and will continue throughout the remaining years as new partners join the collaboration and new tasks are selected for intervention.  We expect Phase 2, awareness and education activities, training activities, and pilot research projects to continue from years 02 through 05.  The last phase, Phase 3 will occur in Year 05 as we attempt to obtain independent funding to continue the work in the Valley.  An External Advisory Group will provide external feedback to the Network and Steering Committee of Network members will make decisions about the research, awareness, and education activities to be done.

"ATECAR: Asian Training, Education on Cancer & Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Asian Americans represent the fastest growing ethnic group in the US.  In PA and NJ, the increase was 75 percent, comprising nearly 12 percent of PA's and more than 8 percent of NJ's populations.  In NY, Asians comprise 6.2 percent of the state's population.  A large subset of this multicultural population is poorly educated, medically uninsured and severely underserved.  As a group, Asians suffer inordinately high rates of cervical, breast, stomach, prostate, colorectal and hepatitis-B-related liver cancers.  While high rates of smoking contribute substantially to elevated rates of lung, esophageal and laryngeal cancers among males, the pervasiveness of secondhand smoke in Asian homes contributes significantly to high rates of these cancers among nonsmoker family members who share the same dwelling.  Specifically, both Asian American men and women have higher incidence and mortality rates of liver cancer than other ethnic groups in the U.S. Lung cancer remains a leading cause of death for Asian males and females and is highest among Vietnamese.  Mortality rates for breast cancer are high among Chinese women.  Vietnamese women have the highest rates of cervical cancer among ethnic groups in the US.  The cancer health disparity gap between Asians and mainstream populations is well documented, requiring a robust and vigorous intervention to ameliorate.  This proposal addresses four major ethnic groups residing in the eastern region of the US:  Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese and Cambodians, of whom more than 60 percent are recent immigrants.  The proposal goals and objectives are based on 5-years of ATECAR-SPN experience with Asian communities in this region and are supported by an elaborate system of experienced community-based partners, academic and research institutions and facilities, bilingual and multi-ethnic professional researchers and trainers and an extensive record of research publications on a range of cancer health disparity issues.  The primary goal of the proposed project is to establish a wider ATECAR Community Network (CN) and will work collaboratively to reduce cancer health disparities through innovative education, research and training strategies.  To accomplish this goal, we will undertake three aims in three phases.  Under Aim I, we plan to maintain and increase capacity building to support community-based participatory education, research, and training to reduce cancer health disparities in the Asian American populations (5 major objectives and 11 sub-objectives are proposed); Aim II, develop and implement community-based participatory research and training programs to reduce cancer health disparities in Asian American populations (3 major objectives and 11 sub-objectives are proposed); and Aim III, establish credibility and sustainability of ATECAR CN programs that reduce cancer health disparities (3 major objectives and 2 sub-objectives are proposed)         ","ATECAR: Asian Training, Education on Cancer & Research",7065296,U01CA114582,"['cooperative study ', ' training aid ', ' neoplasm /cancer education ', ' health science research ', ' human subject ', ' multilingualism ', ' liver neoplasm ', ' lung neoplasm ', ' Asian American ', ' Chinese American ', ' culture ', ' clinical research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,U01,2006,958788,0.0745597675852389

"Involving Communities in Multicultural Network: Access    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed community based participatory research (CBPR) project will promote the involvement and input of community members to improve an established multicultural network/system of care. Specifically, this project will focus on improving outreach and access to care in the area of cardiovascular risk factors, using culturally-appropriate approaches suggested by the community via the CBPR process. This project supports the missions of both the NIH and the NHLBI by working to develop an innovative, community-based model for enhancing access to medical care for low-income, uninsured, minority populations. This project will serve as a pilot to embed CBPR into the developing care network of a large multicultural community, integrating baseline and post-process implementation evaluation components to permit continuous enhancement to the developed strategies for outreach and increased access to care. The multicultural network/system of care, provided by a collaboration of nonprofit organizations coordinated by Primary Care Coalition (PCC) of Montgomery County, MD, currently offers multiple care sites, has successfully implemented shared electronic medical records, and includes minority health initiatives for African American, Asian American, and Latino populations. This project will build on these initiatives, as well as the county-supported Montgomery Cares program, and will incorporate participation from different levels of the community to determine the most appropriate outreach and access to care strategies for each of the represented cultures. Implementation of the project will be guided by the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, with community members making key decisions. Anticipated interventions for participants who exhibit risk factors for cardiovascular disease include: providing an appointment for further evaluation at the network clinics, offering translation services, counseling participants about preventive approaches to health preservation and costs/eligibility for health care services, and supplying information about community support groups. Anticipated additional efforts for the community-at-large will include education and outreach campaigns to inform community members of opportunities for screening. Further, this project anticipates establishing a baseline and surveillance database to support program evaluation and future expansion of the project. This project is relevant to public health because CBPR has the potential to address challenging gaps in the health care system related to social and cultural issues pertinent to each racial/ethnic group represented, and, that if addressed, can facilitate outreach, health awareness, screening participation of those most at risk, and ultimately access to care. With community buy-in and support from community partners and local health clinics, the project team plans to reduce disparities and improve health in a multicultural community.           ",Involving Communities in Multicultural Network: Access,7069258,R21HL084001,"['community health service ', ' health care service planning ', ' health care service availability ', ' medical indigency ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' health care model ', ' health survey ', ' Asian American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' culture ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NHLBI,PRIMARY CARE COALITION/MONTGOMERY COUNTY,R21,2006,148750,0.036661322934985315
"Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Between 1992-2000 among all cancer types, liver cancer, with its 5-year survival rate of less than 10 percent, has the distinction of having the highest annual percent increase in incidence (3.9 percent), while the incidence for the majority of other cancers declined. The highest male incidence rate of liver cancer is among Vietnamese (41.8/100,000), and the highest female incidence is among Koreans (10.0/100,000); for Hmong, the male incidence rate of 25.7/100,000 and the female incidence rate of 8.8/100,000 is intermediate between these other two groups. By contrast, the comparable incidence rates for non-Hispanic White incidence are substantially less: (male, 3.7/100,000; female, 1.5/100,000). These rates indicate that hepatitis-B related liver cancer represents the most drastic cancer health disparity affecting Asian Americans. Each of these 3 Asian groups will be the focus of this P01 entitled, ""Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans."" This P01 is comprised of 3 projects: #1 ""Promoting Hepatitis B Screening for Vietnamese Adults""; #2 ""Community-based Hep B Interventions for Hmong Adults""; and #3 ""Increasing Hep B Screening Among Korean Church Attendees."" Synergy among these projects is exemplified by: having all projects focused on the same dependent variable: increasing hepatitis B serological testing rates among adults, ages 18-64; using the Health Behavior Framework; having interventions that compare effects between intervention and control conditions; having research leaders who have worked over 5 years together through the NCI's Asian American Network for Cancer Awareness Research and Training; and 2 supporting cores:  Biostatistics, and Methodology. Our goals are to: (1) Conduct community-based research interventions, focused on reducing hepatitis B-induced liver cancer morbidity and mortality within these 3 Asian American populations; (2) Analyze data and lessons across projects; and (3) Report progress and share findings with the NCI, ethnic leaders, populations-at-risk and professional audiences. If these goals and the specific aims of each of these three projects are achieved, we expect the relevance of this research to public health to include the first empirically derived data on the effectiveness of community based interventions to reduce hepatitis B-induced liver cancer mortality.           ",Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans,7075079,P01CA109091,"['hepatitis B ', ' virus related neoplasm /cancer ', ' liver neoplasm ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Asian American ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P01,2006,1878844,0.05685013949673395
"Racial Segregation & Disparities in Cancer Outcomes  Cancer of the lung, colon, prostate and breast are the most common cancers in the United States. For each of these common cancers, there is evidence of persistent racial and ethnic disparities in stage at diagnosis, the use of cancer treatments, and/or mortality. Prior work examining cancer disparities has focused on individual characteristics, and has not fully explained the causes of cancer disparities. A growing literature suggests that the attributes of the place where an individual resides may be associated with health outcomes independent of individual characteristics. Residential segregation is one of the characteristics of the social environment that is likely to influence disparities in cancer treatments and outcomes. Segregation may be associated with the use of cancer treatments and outcomes through differences in access to care, the characteristics of providers and facilities where an individual seeks care, beliefs about medical treatments, exposure to stress, social support, socioeconomic deprivation, and access to goods and services. The Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization will be used as the conceptual framework for our hypotheses.  Data from SEER and Medicare will be used to obtain individual demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes for individuals diagnosed with lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancer. This individual-level data will be linked with area-level data about residential segregation. We will determine whether segregation is associated with cancer outcomes overall, and specifically for individuals who are white, African American or Hispanic. Additional data about the characteristics of the social and physical environment will be examined as potential mediators of the association between segregation and cancer outcomes. To examine the effects of segregation on disparities in cancer outcomes, regression models will account for the multi-level structure of the data. The proposed study would provide empirical evidence that could give impetus to area-based interventions to reduce cancer disparities.

"University of Oklahoma Community Networks Project OUCNP    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The burden of cancer in Oklahoma is significant, especially among Native Americans and African Americans.  In general, these two groups have disproportionately higher incidence and mortality rates for many cancers, and they experience higher risks for cancer because of lifestyle choices and barriers to appropriate cancer interventions. Using a model of community participatory planning and research, the Oklahoma Community Networks Program (CNP) seeks to reduce cancer health disparity through the following aims: 1) Establish a collaborative network involving the University of Oklahoma Cancer Center, the Oklahoma State Health Department, the Cherokee Nation, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, and the Oklahoma Conference of Black Mayors; 2) Develop and increase capacity building among these partners to support community-based participatory education, research, and training to reduce cancer health disparities; 3) Develop community-based participatory research and training programs involving these partners to reduce cancer health disparities; 4) Establish credibility and sustainability for CNP activities that reduce cancer health disparities.  Local Community Outreach Specialists and Advisory Committees will evaluate cancer health disparities and assess needs within each community.  Culturally competent cancer prevention and control activities will be planned and delivered. Research and training initiatives will also be generated from the communities. Evaluation of the CNP will include three levels that will be executed consecutively: process, first and second level goals, and project impact. The CNP anticipates providing evidence-based information for reducing cancer disparities to decision and policy makers at the local, state and national levels         ",University of Oklahoma Community Networks Project OUCNP,7065291,U01CA114626,"['cooperative study ', ' neoplasm /cancer education ', ' community health service ', ' human subject ', ' neoplasm /cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Native American ', ' African American ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,U01,2006,678007,0.06938571166750501

The Carolina Community Network (CCN) has set as its mission to reduce prostate, breast and colorectal cancer disparities among adult African Americans by leveraging longstanding university-community relationships and the community-based participatory research expertise at UNC to enhance and extend cancer education and research, research training, and cancer health policy in both secular and faith-based communities.  Specifically, the CCN will:  educate both researchers and community members about cancer health disparities and methods of ameliorating them; train a cadre of academic and community researchers to implement and disseminate best cancer prevention and intervention practices; conduct community based participatory research; change treatment and care-seeking patterns for residents of the communities and identify areas for the development or modification of health policy in the area of cancer prevention and treatment to ultimately eliminate cancer health disparities in North Carolina.  The Carolina Community Network will form a pipeline of cancer education and cancer research projects that will be tailored and piloted in both secular and faith based community settings.  The long term goals of the CCN are to:  1) improve utilization of beneficial cancer interventions; 2) increase the number of minorities in clinical trials and other forms of research; 3) strengthen the community's knowledge of cancer disparities and treatment; and 4) impact cancer prevention and control policies.  The Carolina Community Network is well positioned to address these cancer health disparities because of the depth and breadth of the community-based participatory research expertise at UNC, the availability of contrasting faith-based and secular community partners, and the established ties to community groups.         ",Carolina Community Network,7235258,U01CA114629,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diffusion ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis ', ' Division of Cancer Treatment, Diagnosis and Center ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Information Service ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Secondary Cancer Prevention ', ' Cancer Research Network ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Clinical Trials, Other ', ' Other Minority ', ' UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Lineberger Cancer Center ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' minority health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Numbers ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' North Carolina ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Church ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' member ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Genus Cola ', ' Cola ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Colon ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' care systems ', ' treatment center ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2007,1096323,0.04494081917945159
"Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Between 1992-2000 among all cancer types, liver cancer, with its 5-year survival rate of less than 10 percent, has the distinction of having the highest annual percent increase in incidence (3.9 percent), while the incidence for the majority of other cancers declined. The highest male incidence rate of liver cancer is among Vietnamese (41.8/100,000), and the highest female incidence is among Koreans (10.0/100,000); for Hmong, the male incidence rate of 25.7/100,000 and the female incidence rate of 8.8/100,000 is intermediate between these other two groups. By contrast, the comparable incidence rates for non-Hispanic White incidence are substantially less: (male, 3.7/100,000; female, 1.5/100,000). These rates indicate that hepatitis-B related liver cancer represents the most drastic cancer health disparity affecting Asian Americans. Each of these 3 Asian groups will be the focus of this P01 entitled, ""Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans."" This P01 is comprised of 3 projects: #1 ""Promoting Hepatitis B Screening for Vietnamese Adults""; #2 ""Community-based Hep B Interventions for Hmong Adults""; and #3 ""Increasing Hep B Screening Among Korean Church Attendees."" Synergy among these projects is exemplified by: having all projects focused on the same dependent variable: increasing hepatitis B serological testing rates among adults, ages 18-64; using the Health Behavior Framework; having interventions that compare effects between intervention and control conditions; having research leaders who have worked over 5 years together through the NCI's Asian American Network for Cancer Awareness Research and Training; and 2 supporting cores:  Biostatistics, and Methodology. Our goals are to: (1) Conduct community-based research interventions, focused on reducing hepatitis B-induced liver cancer morbidity and mortality within these 3 Asian American populations; (2) Analyze data and lessons across projects; and (3) Report progress and share findings with the NCI, ethnic leaders, populations-at-risk and professional audiences. If these goals and the specific aims of each of these three projects are achieved, we expect the relevance of this research to public health to include the first empirically derived data on the effectiveness of community based interventions to reduce hepatitis B-induced liver cancer mortality.           ",Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans,7286776,P01CA109091,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P01,2007,1379934,0.05685013949673395
"Minority Pre-doctoral Education to Reduce Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NCI's Plans and Priorities for Cancer Research identifies training of new cancer scientists as one of its ""most important challenges,"" and emphasizes the need for increased involvement of racial and ethnic minorities in cancer research careers.  Increasing minority participation in research careers has also been a major priority in public health, an interdisciplinary field whose contributions to cancer prevention and control have been significant, and largely unique.  Because a more diverse public health work force can better understand and serve the needs of diverse  communities, well-trained minority public health researchers are needed to ensure improvements are made in eliminating health and cancer disparities.  We propose a two-year pre-doctoral education program to prepare African American graduate students in public health to help eliminate cancer disparities through cancer prevention and control research.  The program consists of five main elements.  For students: (1) special coursework in understanding and eliminating cancer disparities; (2) mentored experiential learning in cancer prevention and control research and policy; (3) mentored independent research; and, (4) professional network-building with an interdisciplinary group of African American scholars from a national pool of researchers whose work addresses cancer and/or disparities.  For faculty: (5) skill building in cross-cultural mentoring.  To enhance future adoption of the program by other institutions, these program components will be designed for dissemination and the proposal identifies specific products and mechanisms for distribution.  The School of Public Health and Graduate School at Saint Louis University are strongly committed to this program, and have pledged 85% tuition scholarships for students involved.          ",Minority Pre-doctoral Education to Reduce Disparities,7282567,R25CA102628,"['Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Electronics ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Policy Research ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Site ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Saints ', ' Active Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Funding ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Missouri ', ' cancer prevention ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' Scholarship ', ' Schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Scientist ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Week ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' experience ', ' handbook ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' CD-ROM ', ' Compact Disk Read-Only Memory ', ' CDROM ', ' CD-ROM (Compact Disc-Read Only Memory) ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Communities ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' ']",NCI,SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY,R25,2007,306847,-0.025307738273264227

"Involving Communities in Multicultural Network: From Screening to Access to Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed community based participatory research (CBPR) project will promote the involvement and input of community members to improve an established multicultural network/system of care. Specifically, this project will focus on improving outreach and access to care in the area of cardiovascular risk factors, using culturally-appropriate approaches suggested by the community via the CBPR process. This project supports the missions of both the NIH and the NHLBI by working to develop an innovative, community-based model for enhancing access to medical care for low-income, uninsured, minority populations. This project will serve as a pilot to embed CBPR into the developing care network of a large multicultural community, integrating baseline and post-process implementation evaluation components to permit continuous enhancement to the developed strategies for outreach and increased access to care. The multicultural network/system of care, provided by a collaboration of nonprofit organizations coordinated by Primary Care Coalition (PCC) of Montgomery County, MD, currently offers multiple care sites, has successfully implemented shared electronic medical records, and includes minority health initiatives for African American, Asian American, and Latino populations. This project will build on these initiatives, as well as the county-supported Montgomery Cares program, and will incorporate participation from different levels of the community to determine the most appropriate outreach and access to care strategies for each of the represented cultures. Implementation of the project will be guided by the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, with community members making key decisions. Anticipated interventions for participants who exhibit risk factors for cardiovascular disease include: providing an appointment for further evaluation at the network clinics, offering translation services, counseling participants about preventive approaches to health preservation and costs/eligibility for health care services, and supplying information about community support groups. Anticipated additional efforts for the community-at-large will include education and outreach campaigns to inform community members of opportunities for screening. Further, this project anticipates establishing a baseline and surveillance database to support program evaluation and future expansion of the project. This project is relevant to public health because CBPR has the potential to address challenging gaps in the health care system related to social and cultural issues pertinent to each racial/ethnic group represented, and, that if addressed, can facilitate outreach, health awareness, screening participation of those most at risk, and ultimately access to care. With community buy-in and support from community partners and local health clinics, the project team plans to reduce disparities and improve health in a multicultural community.           ",Involving Communities in Multicultural Network: From Screening to Access to Care,7268061,R21HL084001,"['Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Process ', ' Placement ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' minority health ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Shapes ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Appointment ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' programs ', ' Target Populations ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Translations ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Awareness ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' social ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' County ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Process Assessment (Health Care) ', ' Process Assessment ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Uninsured ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' diagnosis evaluation ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Counseling ', ' Low income ', ' Elements ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NHLBI,PRIMARY CARE COALITION/MONTGOMERY COUNTY,R21,2007,173324,0.034774434233935066

"Southwest Center for Community Health Promotion The Arizona PRC, the Southwest Center for Community Health Promotion (SWCCHP), is the only PRC that works primarily along the U.S.-Mexico border and that focuses on underserved, multi-ethnic communities. Our PRC staff have long-term collaborative relationships with parmers in these communities. The; socioenvironmental context of this region makes it a unique area in which to address significant health disparities in community based participatory research (CBPR). This PRC focuses on CBPR intervention research. Its health priorities are health disparities, primarily diabetes, with a focus also on its precursors and co-morbidity (namely obesity, depression, nutrition, and physical activity), in these communities. These are based on regional and local needs assessments and on local, regional and national health statistics (especially those related to Hispanics). They were chosen in collaboration with our Regional and Local Community Advisory Boards (CABs) and community members, and health departments. This research is conducted within the framework of the PRC national and local logic models and within the conceptual framework of behavioral and environmental change, including the ""change agents change"" approach and the fostering of community capacity-social capital. The program focuses on making changes in physical activity and diet in patients (N=300-400), their families (N= 150-200 families @ 2.5 participants), and in community groups (N=300 - 500), and environmental and policy changes targeting these behaviors. Biological, anthropometric, and behavioral changes are tested as intermediate outcomes. Thus, during the next five years, the PRC in collaboration with its CABs and community partners will conduct and evaluate this CBPR, implement and evaluate the impact of participatory community coalitions and our local and regional CABs on policy change and the sustainability of behavioral interventions, and develop, implement, and evaluate methods to enhance the scope and impact of community health workers (CHWs) through chronic disease prevention and control activities and advocacy, analyzes results and disseminates the successful intervention components.

"CNP: Hepatocellular Carcinoma Screening Practices in HBV Infected Asian Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in cancer screening, care and survival, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unabated and is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide and leads to high mortality. It is well-known that chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV) is a major risk factor for HCC. Despite the presence of recommendations from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) on performing periodic HCC screening, little is known about the screening strategies employed by primary care physicians PCPs) and hepatologists for HBV patients within the United States and in the community setting. Because the incidence of HCC occurs at a greater rate in Asians, this pilot study will target and identify patterns and processes of HBV care within the Asian American community. The study hypotheses are: 1) HBV infected patients who receive care from hepatologists are more likely to be screened in accordance to current AASLD guideline than those who receive care from PCPs, 2) HCC screening is related to patient factors such as age, gender, and cirrhosis as well as provider specialty and years in practice; and 3) HBV infected individuals who are screened for HCC are more likely to have early stages of HCC and therefore undergo therapeutic interventions. To test these hypotheses, we propose to study the following Aims: 1) to describe current HCC screening practices among PCP and hepatologists with large Asian American patient populations, 2) to assess provider and patient factors associated with HCC screening, and 3) to identify the proportion of HCC screened population who underwent therapeutic interventions as compared to HCC unscreened population. This project represents a community-based participatory research effort. Results of this pilot study will provide a baseline understanding of the current HCC screening strategies that is practiced within a community setting. Dissemination and input from Asian American health community providers and advocates will also be part of the future work plan to improve HBV care in San Francisco and community organizations that focuses on reducing cancer health disparities amongst the Asian community. Data collection and analytical results of this study will help provide a basis for identifying gaps in clinical medical education training of management of chronic HBV infected patient population. In addition, this grant will assist in the career development plan of the project leader, Dr. Khalili; allowing her to establish ongoing collaborative research effort with the community and a reputation as a local expert in HBV care. Furthermore, the data gained from this project will serve as the preliminary data for further applications.          ",CNP: Hepatocellular Carcinoma Screening Practices in HBV Infected Asian Americans,7336511,U01CA114640,"['Data Collection ', ' Provider ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Medical Education ', ' Caring ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' intrahepatic ', ' Range ', ' Research Training ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Far East ', ' Eastern Asia ', ' East Asia ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' Guidelines ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hepatitis ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Hepatic ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Individual ', ' Liver diseases ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Development Plans ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Community Networks ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Simian B disease ', ' Simian B virus infection ', ' Simian B disorder ', ' Herpesvirus B infection ', ' Herpes simiae infection ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Awareness ', ' Pattern ', ' Biliary ', ' Training and Education ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' California ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Duct (organ) structure ', ' Duct ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Moon ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' safety net ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2007,77000,0.07092387982450248

"Loma Linda University Center for Health Disparities Res*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For a century, Loma Linda University (LLU) has played a major role in health care access and education in the Inland Empire (IE), California. For all these years LLU has supported the only medical and public health schools servicing a highly diverse community of more than three million people. The present application proposes a plan to establish the first Center for Health Disparities Research (CHDR) in the region. The five-year project proposes an innovative plan to integrate translational biomedical and community-based interdisciplinary research on health disparities with community based participatory research, partnerships for community outreach and education, and training and development of underrepresented scientists. The long-term goal of this application is to hasten the elimination of health disparities by the establishment of the LLUCHDR. The Administrative Core will provide leadership, cohesiveness and vision for the establishment of the required infrastructure to develop and strengthen LLU's capacity to focus on health disparity research.  It will provide the required rules of understanding to integrate researchers from the School of Medicine, Graduate School, and the School of Public Health who share the common goal to eliminate health disparities through research, training, and outreach. The Research Core (RC) will support basic translational research with the final goal to develop interventions to modulate the ""augmented state of cellular oxidative stress"" (ASCOS) triggered by dietary fat, a risk factor that is seriously affecting minority populations. Studies on breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer, diabetes, and stroke will be focused on elucidating how the development of these diseases is mediated through ASCOS-associated signaling pathways. The RC will also support research projects to understand elements of cultural competence and health care access associated with these conditions. The Research Training and Educational Core (RTEC) will integrate current health disparity training programs with the CHDR's initiative to widen the pipeline to high school & undergraduate students in health disparities research. The Community Outreach and Community Partnerships Core (COCPC) will expand existing programs with key community and government entities in the Inland Empire.

"Hispanic Community Network to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hispanics are among the fastest growing population in the United States (US).   Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take advantage of cancer prevention activities than their non-Hispanic White counterparts.  Major concerns related to such under use are low socioeconomic status, lack of insurance, cultural values and norms, treatment options, and knowledge and beliefs concerning cancer.  Further, the Hispanic population as a whole has few mentors and researchers of Hispanic ethnicity to provide culturally appropriate role models for Hispanics to enter cancer research fields.  The overall goal of this proposed five year project is to work with community partners to reduce the cancer health disparities experienced by many Hispanics in a rural area.  We propose to build a Network, or infrastructure of community partners in the Yakima Valley.  With the partners we will promote cancer awareness and education in the Valley, establish a system to recruit minority students to work on cancer prevention projects, develop pilot research projects to address specific cancer disparities in the Valley, develop community research projects to increase cancer education among Hispanics, evaluate the success of the research projects, evaluate the intermediate effects of reducing cancer disparities, and sustain the Network by applying for at least one full-scale trial.   Each of the specific aims is targeted to occur in the three required phases of research.  Phase 1, mobilizing the community, will occur in the first year of the project and will continue throughout the remaining years as new partners join the collaboration and new tasks are selected for intervention.  We expect Phase 2, awareness and education activities, training activities, and pilot research projects to continue from years 02 through 05.  The last phase, Phase 3 will occur in Year 05 as we attempt to obtain independent funding to continue the work in the Valley.  An External Advisory Group will provide external feedback to the Network and Steering Committee of Network members will make decisions about the research, awareness, and education activities to be done.

"Dissemination Research to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent advances in the practice of cancer prevention, cancer disparities have increased because the beneficial impact for vulnerable communities has been unrealized. A severely limited research base to inform dissemination practice has served as a major contributor to the uneven adoption of evidence-based interventions to promote health and prevent disease. As a result, minority and underserved communities suffer a disproportionate share of the national cancer burden. This application focuses on development of a conceptual model that will serve as the basis of developing a future program in dissemination research, related to reduction of cancer disparities. My research to date illustrates that I have developed a number of effective strategies to address cancer risk in diverse populations. The protected time provided by this award will permit me to focus on development of a conceptual framework that could guide my own and other's work related to dissemination and cancer disparities. This award would provide a critical opportunity for me to do the level of in-depth thinking and collaboration that is necessary to address the vexing problem of dissemination of effective cancer prevention interventions, particularly to populations facing persistent disparities. This award will also allow me to heighten and sustain my personal commitment to mentorship of promising new investigators. The focus of my mentoring to date has been largely with women and racial/ethnic minority group members, and I plan to continue to this focus in my future mentoring activities. The K05 award at this timely moment will heighten research productivity in the critical area of dissemination of cancer prevention and control, help foster the careers of many more dedicated cancer control scientists through my mentorship, and ultimately make an impact on reducing cancer disparities for the 21st century.

"Asian American Center on Disparities Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application establishes the Asian American Center on Disparities Research (AACDR). AACDR builds upon a program of research on the mental health issues of Asian American populations that had been carried on since 1988 by the National Research Center on Asian American Mental Health (NRCAAMH). AACDR pursues a research agenda that investigates how cultural factors work to either enhance or mitigate the implementation and effectiveness of evidence-based treatments for Asian American clients.  The center's objectives are to (1) conduct programmatic, problem-oriented research toward the empirical testing of effective clinical   treatments for Asian American populations; (2) conduct research that has theoretical and policy significance for Asian Americans in particular and the mental health field in general; (3) promote and conduct research that addresses key methodological issues involved in the study of diversity and disparities; (4) be the focal point and stimulus for researchers conducting Asian American disparities research on a national level by maintaining and enhancing a network of researchers, service providers, and policy makers to facilitate theory and methodology development; and (5) bridge science into mental health practice, in particular, concerning cultural influences that affect critical problems of treatment and service delivery such as medical non-adherence and premature dropout. The center's Clinical Effectiveness Research Program tests the effectiveness of evidence-based treatments for depression for Asian American clients and identifies the cultural variables that moderate the effects of these interventions. The Therapist Factors Research Program determines if therapist characteristics associated with cultural competence and the use of evidence-based practices interact or independently affect treatment outcomes for mental health outpatient clients. The Medication Adherence Research Program develops and tests the effectiveness of a culturally targeted intervention designed to improve medication adherence among depressed Asian American clients.  Disparities in health care refer to the differential treatment of patients on the basis of race or ethnicity that is not explained by underlying health conditions or treatment preferences of patients (Institute of Medicine, 2002). Since 1978, various presidential commissions have concluded that the disparities were not so much due to racial and ethnic differences in rates of psychopathology but were due to inaccessible and ineffective treatment. Thus, one critical task is to improve therapeutic effectiveness and quality of care for these clients. Essentially, the center's research mission is devoted to and focused on this latter aspect of disparity-cultural factors that affect the effectiveness of treatment.          ",Asian American Center on Disparities Research,7233751,P50MH073511,[''],NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P50,2007,802517,0.02717673204867956
"Racial Segregation & Disparities in Cancer Outcomes  Cancer of the lung, colon, prostate and breast are the most common cancers in the United States. For each of these common cancers, there is evidence of persistent racial and ethnic disparities in stage at diagnosis, the use of cancer treatments, and/or mortality. Prior work examining cancer disparities has focused on individual characteristics, and has not fully explained the causes of cancer disparities. A growing literature suggests that the attributes of the place where an individual resides may be associated with health outcomes independent of individual characteristics. Residential segregation is one of the characteristics of the social environment that is likely to influence disparities in cancer treatments and outcomes. Segregation may be associated with the use of cancer treatments and outcomes through differences in access to care, the characteristics of providers and facilities where an individual seeks care, beliefs about medical treatments, exposure to stress, social support, socioeconomic deprivation, and access to goods and services. The Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization will be used as the conceptual framework for our hypotheses.  Data from SEER and Medicare will be used to obtain individual demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes for individuals diagnosed with lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancer. This individual-level data will be linked with area-level data about residential segregation. We will determine whether segregation is associated with cancer outcomes overall, and specifically for individuals who are white, African American or Hispanic. Additional data about the characteristics of the social and physical environment will be examined as potential mediators of the association between segregation and cancer outcomes. To examine the effects of segregation on disparities in cancer outcomes, regression models will account for the multi-level structure of the data. The proposed study would provide empirical evidence that could give impetus to area-based interventions to reduce cancer disparities.

The highest male incidence rate of liver cancer is among Vietnamese (41.8/100,000), and the highest female incidence is among Koreans (10.0/100,000); for Hmong, the male  ncidence rate of 25.7/100,00 and the female incidence rate of 8.8/100,000 is intermediate between these other two groups. By contrast, the comparable incidence rates for non-Hispanic White incidence are substantially less: (male, 3.7/100,000; female, 1.5/100,000). These rates indicate that hepatitis-B related  iver cancer represents the most drastic cancer health disparity affecting Asian Americans.  Each of these 3 Asian groups will be the focus of this P01 entitled, ""Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans."" This P01 is comprised of 3 projects: #1 ""Promoting Hepatitis B Screening for Vietnamese Adults""; #2 ""Community-based Hep B Interventions for Hmong Adults""; and #3 ""Increasing Hep B Screening Among Korean Church Attendees."" Synergy among these projects is exemplified by: having all projects foused on the same dependent variable: increasing hepatitis B serological testing rates among adults, ages 18-64; using the Health Behavior Framework; having interventions that compare effects between intervention and control conditions; having research leaders who have worked over 5 years together through the NCI's Asian American Network for Cancer Awareness Research and Training; and 3 supporting cores: A. Administrative; B. Biostatistics, and C. Methodology. Our goals are to: (1) Conduct community-based research interventions, focused on reducing hepatitis B-induced liver cancer morbidity and mortality within these 3 Asian American populations; (2) Analyze data and lessons across projects; and (3) Report progress  and share findings with the NCI, ethnic leaders, populations-at-risk and professional audiences. If these  goals and the specific aims of each of these three projects are achieved, we expect the relevance of this  research to public health to include the first empirically derived data on the effectiveness of community-  based interventions to reduce hepatitis B-induced liver cancer mortality.

"ATECAR: Asian Training, Education on Cancer & Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Asian Americans represent the fastest growing ethnic group in the US.  In PA and NJ, the increase was 75 percent, comprising nearly 12 percent of PA's and more than 8 percent of NJ's populations.  In NY, Asians comprise 6.2 percent of the state's population.  A large subset of this multicultural population is poorly educated, medically uninsured and severely underserved.  As a group, Asians suffer inordinately high rates of cervical, breast, stomach, prostate, colorectal and hepatitis-B-related liver cancers.  While high rates of smoking contribute substantially to elevated rates of lung, esophageal and laryngeal cancers among males, the pervasiveness of secondhand smoke in Asian homes contributes significantly to high rates of these cancers among nonsmoker family members who share the same dwelling.  Specifically, both Asian American men and women have higher incidence and mortality rates of liver cancer than other ethnic groups in the U.S. Lung cancer remains a leading cause of death for Asian males and females and is highest among Vietnamese.  Mortality rates for breast cancer are high among Chinese women.  Vietnamese women have the highest rates of cervical cancer among ethnic groups in the US.  The cancer health disparity gap between Asians and mainstream populations is well documented, requiring a robust and vigorous intervention to ameliorate.  This proposal addresses four major ethnic groups residing in the eastern region of the US:  Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese and Cambodians, of whom more than 60 percent are recent immigrants.  The proposal goals and objectives are based on 5-years of ATECAR-SPN experience with Asian communities in this region and are supported by an elaborate system of experienced community-based partners, academic and research institutions and facilities, bilingual and multi-ethnic professional researchers and trainers and an extensive record of research publications on a range of cancer health disparity issues.  The primary goal of the proposed project is to establish a wider ATECAR Community Network (CN) and will work collaboratively to reduce cancer health disparities through innovative education, research and training strategies.  To accomplish this goal, we will undertake three aims in three phases.  Under Aim I, we plan to maintain and increase capacity building to support community-based participatory education, research, and training to reduce cancer health disparities in the Asian American populations (5 major objectives and 11 sub-objectives are proposed); Aim II, develop and implement community-based participatory research and training programs to reduce cancer health disparities in Asian American populations (3 major objectives and 11 sub-objectives are proposed); and Aim III, establish credibility and sustainability of ATECAR CN programs that reduce cancer health disparities (3 major objectives and 2 sub-objectives are proposed)         ","ATECAR: Asian Training, Education on Cancer & Research",7274890,U01CA114582,"['Government ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Procedures ', '

"Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TB-CCN): A Model fo*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In response to an urgent need to create solutions for the development of efficacious cancer interventions for the effective penetration within the community, H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute at the University of South Florida, in collaboration with local community-based heath centers, social service agencies, faith-based groups, adult education and literacy groups, and local media will form the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TB-CCN).  This local network will aim to address critical access, prevention and control issues that impact medically underserved, low-literacy   and low-income populations in selected areas of Hillsborough, Pinellas and Pasco Counties.  This tri-county area is ethnically diverse and includes a growing number of foreign-born populations.  Meeting this goal will involve cancer awareness and education activities, the use of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods, and the creation of sustainable collaborations and partnerships.  The development of the network draws on the strengths of our existing community-academic partnerships, our considerable experience in developing innovative education and training programs that examine the nexus of culture and literacy across the continuum of cancer care, and community partners with a mutual goal of improved health.  Underlying theoretical principles that guide the development of our network include Freire's critical pedagogy and critical anthropology of health.  Specific aims are to:   1) Create a solid, robust and sustainable core organizational network infrastructure through collaborations, partnerships and community capacity building activities (Phase I):   2) Develop an Education and Training Hub for the delivery of innovative community-based participatory research, training and education (Phase II); and   3) Disseminate evidence-based information through traditional and community-based media (Phase III).   Project evaluation will include both process and outcome evaluations according to each phase.  The overall success of the TB-CCN will be evaluated by the achievement of a sustainable network for education; research and diffusion of information as assessed by the creation of a solid sustainable infrastructure, development of relevant education and training activities, increased access and utilizations of screening services, generation of research proposals and other unique applications of knowledge.

"Asian American Center on Disparities Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application establishes the Asian American Center on Disparities Research (AACDR). AACDR builds upon a program of research on the mental health issues of Asian American populations that had been carried on since 1988 by the National Research Center on Asian American Mental Health (NRCAAMH). AACDR pursues a research agenda that investigates how cultural factors work to either enhance or mitigate the implementation and effectiveness of evidence-based treatments for Asian American clients.  The center's objectives are to (1) conduct programmatic, problem-oriented research toward the empirical testing of effective clinical   treatments for Asian American populations; (2) conduct research that has theoretical and policy significance for Asian Americans in particular and the mental health field in general; (3) promote and conduct research that addresses key methodological issues involved in the study of diversity and disparities; (4) be the focal point and stimulus for researchers conducting Asian American disparities research on a national level by maintaining and enhancing a network of researchers, service providers, and policy makers to facilitate theory and methodology development; and (5) bridge science into mental health practice, in particular, concerning cultural influences that affect critical problems of treatment and service delivery such as medical non-adherence and premature dropout. The center's Clinical Effectiveness Research Program tests the effectiveness of evidence-based treatments for depression for Asian American clients and identifies the cultural variables that moderate the effects of these interventions. The Therapist Factors Research Program determines if therapist characteristics associated with cultural competence and the use of evidence-based practices interact or independently affect treatment outcomes for mental health outpatient clients. The Medication Adherence Research Program develops and tests the effectiveness of a culturally targeted intervention designed to improve medication adherence among depressed Asian American clients.  Disparities in health care refer to the differential treatment of patients on the basis of race or ethnicity that is not explained by underlying health conditions or treatment preferences of patients (Institute of Medicine, 2002). Since 1978, various presidential commissions have concluded that the disparities were not so much due to racial and ethnic differences in rates of psychopathology but were due to inaccessible and ineffective treatment. Thus, one critical task is to improve therapeutic effectiveness and quality of care for these clients. Essentially, the center's research mission is devoted to and focused on this latter aspect of disparity-cultural factors that affect the effectiveness of treatment.          ",Asian American Center on Disparities Research,7470098,P50MH073511,[''],NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P50,2008,770122,0.02717673204867956
"Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Between 1992-2000 among all cancer types, liver cancer, with its 5-year survival rate of less than 10 percent, has the distinction of having the highest annual percent increase in incidence (3.9 percent), while the incidence for the majority of other cancers declined. The highest male incidence rate of liver cancer is among Vietnamese (41.8/100,000), and the highest female incidence is among Koreans (10.0/100,000); for Hmong, the male incidence rate of 25.7/100,000 and the female incidence rate of 8.8/100,000 is intermediate between these other two groups. By contrast, the comparable incidence rates for non-Hispanic White incidence are substantially less: (male, 3.7/100,000; female, 1.5/100,000). These rates indicate that hepatitis-B related liver cancer represents the most drastic cancer health disparity affecting Asian Americans. Each of these 3 Asian groups will be the focus of this P01 entitled, ""Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans."" This P01 is comprised of 3 projects: #1 ""Promoting Hepatitis B Screening for Vietnamese Adults""; #2 ""Community-based Hep B Interventions for Hmong Adults""; and #3 ""Increasing Hep B Screening Among Korean Church Attendees."" Synergy among these projects is exemplified by: having all projects focused on the same dependent variable: increasing hepatitis B serological testing rates among adults, ages 18-64; using the Health Behavior Framework; having interventions that compare effects between intervention and control conditions; having research leaders who have worked over 5 years together through the NCI's Asian American Network for Cancer Awareness Research and Training; and 2 supporting cores:  Biostatistics, and Methodology. Our goals are to: (1) Conduct community-based research interventions, focused on reducing hepatitis B-induced liver cancer morbidity and mortality within these 3 Asian American populations; (2) Analyze data and lessons across projects; and (3) Report progress and share findings with the NCI, ethnic leaders, populations-at-risk and professional audiences. If these goals and the specific aims of each of these three projects are achieved, we expect the relevance of this research to public health to include the first empirically derived data on the effectiveness of community based interventions to reduce hepatitis B-induced liver cancer mortality.           ",Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans,7496093,P01CA109091,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P01,2008,1383779,0.05685013949673395
"Southwest Center for Community Health Promotion The Arizona PRC, the Southwest Center for Community Health Promotion (SWCCHP), is the only PRC that works primarily along the U.S.-Mexico border and that focuses on underserved, multi-ethnic communities. Our PRC staff have long-term collaborative relationships with parmers in these communities. The; socioenvironmental context of this region makes it a unique area in which to address significant health disparities in community based participatory research (CBPR). This PRC focuses on CBPR intervention research. Its health priorities are health disparities, primarily diabetes, with a focus also on its precursors and co-morbidity (namely obesity, depression, nutrition, and physical activity), in these communities. These are based on regional and local needs assessments and on local, regional and national health statistics (especially those related to Hispanics). They were chosen in collaboration with our Regional and Local Community Advisory Boards (CABs) and community members, and health departments. This research is conducted within the framework of the PRC national and local logic models and within the conceptual framework of behavioral and environmental change, including the ""change agents change"" approach and the fostering of community capacity-social capital. The program focuses on making changes in physical activity and diet in patients (N=300-400), their families (N= 150-200 families @ 2.5 participants), and in community groups (N=300 - 500), and environmental and policy changes targeting these behaviors. Biological, anthropometric, and behavioral changes are tested as intermediate outcomes. Thus, during the next five years, the PRC in collaboration with its CABs and community partners will conduct and evaluate this CBPR, implement and evaluate the impact of participatory community coalitions and our local and regional CABs on policy change and the sustainability of behavioral interventions, and develop, implement, and evaluate methods to enhance the scope and impact of community health workers (CHWs) through chronic disease prevention and control activities and advocacy, analyzes results and disseminates the successful intervention components. Further, the PRC will engage in training and education primarily of CHWs and community members.

"HORIZON Center: Healthy Options, Research, Interventions & Community Organizing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass Boston) and Harvard University School of Public Health (HSPH) have partnered with the Cherishing Our Hearts and Souls Coalition (COHS) of Roxbury (a Boston neighborhood comprised of 51% African Americans and 23% Hispanics) to establish an exploratory Center (P20) for Health and Health Care Disparities that is dedicated to Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR). The Healthy Options, Research, Interventions & Community Organizing Center (HORIZON Center) will: 1) conduct health disparities related research projects in partnership with COHS, 2) offer research training, with an emphasis in CBPR, to faculty, students, and community stakeholders, and 3) build a neighborhood based infrastructure that can partner with academic institutions in Boston to research and implement ""best practices"" in CBPR and academic-community partnerships. UMass Boston was designated a minority-serving institution by the National Cancer Institute and is the lead partner in the HORIZON Center. The diverse characteristics and strengths reflected in both academic institutions and in the six-year old community coalition (COHS) set the stage for significant changes in cultural norms (public knowledge, attitudes and behaviors) and professional practices surrounding research activities and academic community partnerships. The implications of successfully engaging a diverse urban underserved community in health promotion activities, in research and in advancing the cause of research are nationally significant. We partner to further the research mission of COHS and its Community Research Advisory Board (CRAB). The HORIZON Center has 4 cores, 3 research projects and 6 pilot projects; all designed to strengthen the evidence-based practices and strategies for understanding and training practitioners in health disparities reduction. We propose to increase the number of local agencies, community organizations and residents that contribute to and participate in research, training, health promotion, and community organizing activities. The cores provide an infrastructure and process for the translation of research into innovative community outreach strategies, educational interventions and public policy initiatives. The Administrative Core provides overall support to the HORIZON Center by coordinating the other cores and projects. The Research Core supports the research projects which are investigating the behavioral, social, and biological sciences related to health disparities. The Community Engagement Core is responsible for projects that investigate the best practices for outreach and mobilization in an urban community.

"ASIAN AMERICAN NETWORK FOR CANCER AWARENESS RESEARCH & TRAINING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The overall mission of the Asian American Network for Cancer Awareness, Research and Training (AANCART) is to reduce cancer health disparities by conducting community-based participatory education, training, and research by, for, and with Asian Americans in Sacramento, CA (also serves as Headquarters); San Francisco, CA; Los Angeles, CA; Seattle, WA; Hawaii (state); and Houston, TX.  This Network is a national one, comprised of seven NCI cancer centers and their associated universities, the California Department of Health Services, Chinese Community Health Care Association, and the Hmong Women's Heritage Association.  Cumulatively, this Network serves nearly 50 percent of all Asian Americans.  Consistent with RFA-CA-05-012, AANCART's deliverables are:  (1) Sustenance of a highly interactive Network among AANCART regions to catalyze cancer education for Asian Americans; (2) Establishment of research training programs that address Asian American cancer health disparities; and (3) Process and impact data to document the extent to which specific cancer health disparities are reduced among Cambodians, Chinese, Filipino, Hmong, Korean, and Vietnamese.  Examples of Asian American disparities to be addressed include those associated with smoking-related lung and hepatitis B-induced liver cancers, low breast and cervical cancer screening rates, and emerging cancer threats posed by acculturation, diet, and insufficient ethnically-specific representation in clinical trials. Aims will be achieved through both Network-wide and regional activities by the AANCART Steering Committee and involving Asian American-oriented community-based organizations, Cancer Information Service staff, and other supportive entities tied together through past histories of collaboration and memoranda of understanding and letters of support.  Universities associated with AANCART, the California Department of Health and the Chinese Community Health Plan are committed to additional support for AANCART.

"ATECAR: Asian Training, Education on Cancer & Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Asian Americans represent the fastest growing ethnic group in the US.  In PA and NJ, the increase was 75 percent, comprising nearly 12 percent of PA's and more than 8 percent of NJ's populations.  In NY, Asians comprise 6.2 percent of the state's population.  A large subset of this multicultural population is poorly educated, medically uninsured and severely underserved.  As a group, Asians suffer inordinately high rates of cervical, breast, stomach, prostate, colorectal and hepatitis-B-related liver cancers.  While high rates of smoking contribute substantially to elevated rates of lung, esophageal and laryngeal cancers among males, the pervasiveness of secondhand smoke in Asian homes contributes significantly to high rates of these cancers among nonsmoker family members who share the same dwelling.  Specifically, both Asian American men and women have higher incidence and mortality rates of liver cancer than other ethnic groups in the U.S. Lung cancer remains a leading cause of death for Asian males and females and is highest among Vietnamese.  Mortality rates for breast cancer are high among Chinese women.  Vietnamese women have the highest rates of cervical cancer among ethnic groups in the US.  The cancer health disparity gap between Asians and mainstream populations is well documented, requiring a robust and vigorous intervention to ameliorate.  This proposal addresses four major ethnic groups residing in the eastern region of the US:  Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese and Cambodians, of whom more than 60 percent are recent immigrants.  The proposal goals and objectives are based on 5-years of ATECAR-SPN experience with Asian communities in this region and are supported by an elaborate system of experienced community-based partners, academic and research institutions and facilities, bilingual and multi-ethnic professional researchers and trainers and an extensive record of research publications on a range of cancer health disparity issues.  The primary goal of the proposed project is to establish a wider ATECAR Community Network (CN) and will work collaboratively to reduce cancer health disparities through innovative education, research and training strategies.  To accomplish this goal, we will undertake three aims in three phases.  Under Aim I, we plan to maintain and increase capacity building to support community-based participatory education, research, and training to reduce cancer health disparities in the Asian American populations (5 major objectives and 11 sub-objectives are proposed); Aim II, develop and implement community-based participatory research and training programs to reduce cancer health disparities in Asian American populations (3 major objectives and 11 sub-objectives are proposed); and Aim III, establish credibility and sustainability of ATECAR CN programs that reduce cancer health disparities (3

"Carolina Community Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Four in every ten North Carolinians will develop cancer during their lives.  It is evident that cancer is a major health concern as well as major health disparity, not only with regards to gender and racial differences but geographically as well.  The Carolina Community Network (CCN) has set as its mission to reduce prostate, breast and colorectal cancer disparities among adult African Americans by leveraging longstanding university-community relationships and the community-based participatory research expertise at UNC to enhance and extend cancer education and research, research training, and cancer health policy in both secular and faith-based communities.  Specifically, the CCN will:  educate both researchers and community members about cancer health disparities and methods of ameliorating them; train a cadre of academic and community researchers to implement and disseminate best cancer prevention and intervention practices; conduct community based participatory research; change treatment and care-seeking patterns for residents of the communities and identify areas for the development or modification of health policy in the area of cancer prevention and treatment to ultimately eliminate cancer health disparities in North Carolina.  The Carolina Community Network will form a pipeline of cancer education and cancer research projects that will be tailored and piloted in both secular and faith based community settings.  The long term goals of the CCN are to:  1) improve utilization of beneficial cancer interventions; 2) increase the number of minorities in clinical trials and other forms of research; 3) strengthen the community's knowledge of cancer disparities and treatment; and 4) impact cancer prevention and control policies.  The Carolina Community Network is well positioned to address these cancer health disparities because of the depth and breadth of the community-based participatory research expertise at UNC, the availability of contrasting faith-based and secular community partners, and the established ties to community groups.         ",Carolina Community Network,7415153,U01CA114629,"['Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' minority health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Numbers ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' North Carolina ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Church ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' member ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Genus Cola ', ' Cola ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Colon ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' care systems ', ' treatment center ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diffusion ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis ', ' Division of Cancer Treatment, Diagnosis and Center ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Information Service ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Secondary Cancer Prevention ', ' Cancer Research Network ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Clinical Trials, Other ', ' Other Minority ', ' UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Lineberger Cancer Center ', ' Modification ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2008,1246607,0.04494081917945159
"National Black Leadership Initiative on Cancer III: Community Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application describes an effort to implement a large-scale, national Community Networks Program (CNP) to reduce cancer health disparities among African Americans.

"Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TB-CCN): A Model fo*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In response to an urgent need to create solutions for the development of efficacious cancer interventions for the effective penetration within the community, H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute at the University of South Florida, in collaboration with local community-based heath centers, social service agencies, faith-based groups, adult education and literacy groups, and local media will form the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TB-CCN).  This local network will aim to address critical access, prevention and control issues that impact medically underserved, low-literacy   and low-income populations in selected areas of Hillsborough, Pinellas and Pasco Counties.  This tri-county area is ethnically diverse and includes a growing number of foreign-born populations.  Meeting this goal will involve cancer awareness and education activities, the use of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods, and the creation of sustainable collaborations and partnerships.  The development of the network draws on the strengths of our existing community-academic partnerships, our considerable experience in developing innovative education and training programs that examine the nexus of culture and literacy across the continuum of cancer care, and community partners with a mutual goal of improved health.  Underlying theoretical principles that guide the development of our network include Freire's critical pedagogy and critical anthropology of health.  Specific aims are to:   1) Create a solid, robust and sustainable core organizational network infrastructure through collaborations, partnerships and community capacity building activities (Phase I):   2) Develop an Education and Training Hub for the delivery of innovative community-based participatory research, training and education (Phase II); and   3) Disseminate evidence-based information through traditional and community-based media (Phase III).   Project evaluation will include both process and outcome evaluations according to each phase.  The overall success of the TB-CCN will be evaluated by the achievement of a sustainable network for education; research and diffusion of information as assessed by the creation of a solid sustainable infrastructure, development of relevant education and training activities, increased access and utilizations of screening services, generation of research proposals and other unique applications of knowledge.  It is anticipated that the efforts of the TB-CCN will yield innovative models for education, service delivery and research that can readily be exported and transferred for broad application to other settings and populations for reducing cancer health disparities         ",Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TB-CCN): A Model fo*,7685879,U01CA114627,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diffusion ', ' Purpose ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', "" H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute at the University of'south Florida "", ' Health Communication ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Prevention education ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Fairs ', ' minority health ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Diffuse ', ' Penetration ', ' Phase ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' literacy ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Anthropology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Societies ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Event ', ' Awareness ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Training and Education ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer care ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Nexus (resin cement) ', ' ']",NCI,H.

In general, these two groups have disproportionately higher incidence and mortality rates for many cancers, and they experience higher risks for cancer because of lifestyle choices and barriers to appropriate cancer interventions. Using a model of community participatory planning and research, the Oklahoma Community Networks Program (CNP) seeks to reduce cancer health disparity through the following aims: 1) Establish a collaborative network involving the University of Oklahoma Cancer Center, the Oklahoma State Health Department, the Cherokee Nation, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, and the Oklahoma Conference of Black Mayors; 2) Develop and increase capacity building among these partners to support community-based participatory education, research, and training to reduce cancer health disparities; 3) Develop community-based participatory research and training programs involving these partners to reduce cancer health disparities; 4) Establish credibility and sustainability for CNP activities that reduce cancer health disparities.  Local Community Outreach Specialists and Advisory Committees will evaluate cancer health disparities and assess needs within each community.  Culturally competent cancer prevention and control activities will be planned and delivered. Research and training initiatives will also be generated from the communities.

"P.L.A.N.E.T. MassCONECT to Promote Evidence-Based Interventions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community partnerships provide a key vehicle for dissemination of evidence-based interventions to promote cancer prevention. Despite fundamental advances in the development of evidence-based interventions, there are significant gaps in translation of this knowledge. In particular, little is known about the barriers faced by community groups in adopting successful evidence-based interventions and how dissemination can be accomplished in community settings. Even less is known about the adoption of these interventions by groups working with the underserved. The goal of our proposed project is to test a community participatory model for dissemination of evidence- based cancer prevention interventions by combining the elements of a national resource, the Cancer Control PLANET, and our close collaborative relationships with community partners developed through MassCONECT, a NCI-funded Community Network Program intervening to reduce cancer disparities in three Massachusetts communities: Boston, Lawrence & Worcester. Using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles as the central guiding framework, we will promote the adoption of our intervention called PLANET MassCONECT, a web portal that adopts the national resource to local conditions. This community participatory model includes several key steps: (1) to seek community input from the Community Project Advisory Committee (C-PAC) and through formative research to assess community- specific factors influencing adoption of the PLANET; and (2) establish a dedicated, customized web portal, PLANET MassCONECT, that presents useable information organized to prevent information overload. To test the model, we will examine if the provision of three types of capital } human capital (community health educators serving as technical resources and workshops to train community members), social capital (communications among potential users leading to social capital), and financial capital (modest infrastructure support and pilot intervention grants) } will increase the organizational capacity to plan, adopt and implement evidence-based cancer control interventions in communities of three different sizes and structures. The outcomes of interest are collective efficacy, use of PLANET MassCONECT, PLANET reach, program planning and program adoption. We plan to disseminate the intervention, if successful, using two national cancer prevention networks funded by NCI and CDC, NCI's Cancer Information Service and the American Cancer Society. This study builds from a solid foundation of collaboration among community, academic and national partners to advance our understanding of dissemination of evidence-based interventions through community-based participatory approach.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of PLANET MassCONECT is to design and test a model of dissemination of evidenced-based cancer-control interventions for adoption by community groups who serve the underserved in three Massachusetts communities - Boston, Lawrence, and Worcester.

"Dallas Cancer Disparities Coalition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant socioeconomic and racial cancer disparities are evident in the South Dallas/Fair Park area, a low socioeconomic, largely minority population in Dallas, Texas, with a cancer mortality rate approximately 1.5 times greater than that of Dallas County as a whole. Community-based participatory research (CBPR), a collaborative research approach that combines community needs assessment with community capacity-building strategies, is one method that has been successfully used for cancer-control research. The Trans-HHS Cancer Health Disparities Progress Review Group suggests that CBPR may be an ideal way to tackle cancer disparities in underserved populations, such as that of South Dallas. The objective of this study is to implement an effective CBPR approach to reduce the presence of cancer and cancer-related health behavior in this population. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to work collaboratively with the community to identify priority cancer disparities based on the results of a community diagnosis that explores behavioral, cultural, dietary, socioeconomic, and political determinants of these disparities and the strengths and assets of the South Dallas/Fair Park area to mitigate these factors; and (2) to develop innovative community-based intervention approaches to reduce and eliminate cancer disparities in the South Dallas/Fair Park area. Investigators and community members will create an advisory board to initiate dialogue regarding cancer disparities. The results of a recently conducted South Dallas Needs Assessment will be discussed in focus groups to identify factors contributing to cancer disparities in the community. Investigators will analyze the data from the needs assessment and focus groups and disseminate the results to the community. The advisory board will design an appropriate intervention, and the intervention will be pilot tested in the Frazier Courts area. The outcomes and processes of the intervention as well as the CBPR processes will be evaluated. This project is expected to contribute to the reduction of cancer in the South Dallas/Fair Park area by educating residents about the level of cancer and disparities in the community; identifying determinants of cancer in the community; and implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention. Furthermore, this project will support the National Cancer Institute's commitment to eliminate cancer disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cancer disparities are a major public health concern, as seen by the National Cancer Institute's commitment to eliminate cancer disparities. The goal of the Dallas Cancer Disparities Research Coalition is to reduce the presence of cancer in the South Dallas/Fair Park area by educating residents about the level of cancer and cancer disparities in their community, by identifying determinants of cancer in the community, and by implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of the collaborative intervention. This project will empower the community in the cancer battle by involving them in every step of the research process, thus making the community members more likely to participate and succeed in the recommended cancer-control strategies.          ",Dallas Cancer Disparities Coalition,7428782,R21CA126732,"['cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Health Sciences ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Behavioral ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' court ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Physical activity ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' County ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Actions ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R21,2008,185700,0.07047120867940292
"Asian American Liver Cancer Education Program in  Maryland    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for over half of the 1.3 million chronic Hepatitis B cases and deaths from Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the U.S. This excess risk can be attributed to high rates of HBV infection (particularly among first generation immigrants), in combination with low rates of HBV screening and vaccination due to cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers. Because of these combined risk factors, Asian Americans are often diagnosed with late stage cancer, resulting in low survival rates and high mortality rates.       In response to this cancer-related health disparity, this project seeks to develop and implement educational programs to promote HBV screening and increase awareness of liver cancer prevention of Asian Americans in Maryland. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop educational strategies tailored to the needs of target communities to increase public awareness of liver cancer prevention; 2) Implement theory-driven and culturally integrated community-based cancer intervention programs; and 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention on hepatitis B and liver cancer awareness and HBV screening behavior.       Using a randomized control design, a total 900 Asian Americans (300 Vietnamese, Koreans, and Chinese each) age 18 and older will be recruited from 12 community-based organizations (CBO). Each CBO will be randomly assigned to either an intervention (n=6) or control group (n=6). Eligible participants will complete a survey and those in the intervention groups will participate in an educational program. An immediate post survey will be issued to examine the effects of the intervention on intention to obtain HBV screening. Participants will be telephone interviewed 6 months after the intervention to assess actual screening practice. Those in the control group will receive a delayed intervention after the posttest. The insights gained from this proposed liver cancer education program will be valuable in implementing cancer intervention programs for other high risk non-English speaking populations, including economically disadvantaged minorities and will address health disparities in immigrant populations.             ",Asian American Liver Cancer Education Program in  Maryland,7432919,R25CA129042,"['Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Awareness ', ' Country ', ' Hepatitis B Vaccination ', ' Hepatitis B series immunization ', ' Hepatitis B injection ', ' Hepatitis B immunization ', ' Hep B vaccination ', ' Behavior ', ' Chronic Hepatitis B ', ' chronic hepatitis B virus infection ', ' chronic HBV infection ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Korean American ', ' intervention program ', ' liver cancer prevention ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Generations ', ' Chinese American ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' eligible participant ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Rate ', ' Intention ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Chronic ', ' Solid ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Maryland ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' North America ', ' Koreans ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Simian B disease ', ' Simian B virus infection ', ' Simian B disorder ', ' Herpesvirus B infection ', ' Herpes simiae infection ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R25,2008,276609,0.056331091226951076

"Carolina Community Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Four in every ten North Carolinians will develop cancer during their lives.  It is evident that cancer is a major health concern as well as major health disparity, not only with regards to gender and racial differences but geographically as well.  The Carolina Community Network (CCN) has set as its mission to reduce prostate, breast and colorectal cancer disparities among adult African Americans by leveraging longstanding university-community relationships and the community-based participatory research expertise at UNC to enhance and extend cancer education and research, research training, and cancer health policy in both secular and faith-based communities.  Specifically, the CCN will:  educate both researchers and community members about cancer health disparities and methods of ameliorating them; train a cadre of academic and community researchers to implement and disseminate best cancer prevention and intervention practices; conduct community based participatory research; change treatment and care-seeking patterns for residents of the communities and identify areas for the development or modification of health policy in the area of cancer prevention and treatment to ultimately eliminate cancer health disparities in North Carolina.  The Carolina Community Network will form a pipeline of cancer education and cancer research projects that will be tailored and piloted in both secular and faith based community settings.  The long term goals of the CCN are to:  1) improve utilization of beneficial cancer interventions; 2) increase the number of minorities in clinical trials and other forms of research; 3) strengthen the community's knowledge of cancer disparities and treatment; and 4) impact cancer prevention and control policies.  The Carolina Community Network is well positioned to address these cancer health disparities because of the depth and breadth of the community-based participatory research expertise at UNC, the availability of contrasting faith-based and secular community partners, and the established ties to community groups.         ",Carolina Community Network,7686423,U01CA114629,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diffusion ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis ', ' Division of Cancer Treatment, Diagnosis and Center ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Information Service ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Secondary Cancer Prevention ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' North Carolina ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Church ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' member ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Genus Cola ', ' Cola ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Colon ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' care systems ', ' treatment center ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Cancer Research Network ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Clinical Trials, Other ', ' Other Minority ', ' UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Lineberger Cancer Center ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' minority health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Numbers ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2008,105889,0.04494081917945159

"American Indian and Latino Community Ambassadors to Cancer Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective cancer research programs often rely on a collaborative network of community and academic organizations, following the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR). CBPR can be defined as ""a partnership approach to research that equitably involves, for example, community members, organizational representatives, and researchers in all aspects of the research process and in which all partners contribute expertise and share decision making and ownership"". 1 Much successful CBPR work has been done to reduce cancer-related health disparities, yet no single, transferable model of CBPR that identifies specific ways for community members to participate in each stage of research exists. We propose the development of a CBPR model through a collaborative effort among cancer researchers at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) Cancer Center's Community Engagement Core and community members. This new core has developed through the union of two successful CBPR teams with the American Indian and Latino communities. The model will be developed through the pilot testing of a oneyear curriculum, Community Ambassadors to Cancer Research, and accompanying interactive web site that will educate community members about research while simultaneously educating researchers about the needs of the community. The primary goal of this project is to bring community members and researchers together to create a transferable model of CBPR with community involvement at each step of the research process. This will ensure a strong Community Engagement Core at the KUMC Cancer Center and allow us to create CBPR teams that can effectively compete for extramural grants. Ten competitively chosen community members will meet for two weeklong sessions at KUMC in months 1 and 12 of the program and 10 monthly oneday sessions held alternately at each of our community-based sites, the Heart of America Indian Center and el Centro, Inc. At each session, a researcher will present a part of the research process and a community leader will present a cancerrelated issue of importance to the community. Researchers and community members will then work together to determine the CBPR model for that stage of research. In addition, throughout the program researchers and community members with similar interests will be introduced to facilitate the formation of CBPR teams. We anticipate forming at least one new CBPR team that will be able to effectively submit for extramural funding within 6 months of program completion. In between sessions, participants and researchers will work together through an interactive web site. To determine effectiveness of program components, participants will complete preand posttesting on each step of the research process. We also plan a thorough process evaluation to determine strengths and weaknesses of the program. At program completion, we will have a transferable model of CBPR to present to both researchers and community members which will serve as the basis for the new Community Engagement Core of the KUMC Cancer Center.           ",American Indian and Latino Community Ambassadors to Cancer Research,7556555,R03CA139568,"['Credentialing ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Decision Making ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heart ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Kansas ', ' Learning ', ' Trust ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Americas ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Motivation ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Community Networks ', ' Ownership ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Staging ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' day ', ' Week ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Certification ', ' Medical Research ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' desire ', ' model development ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' forging ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2008,80850,0.007493055545041392
"Dissemination Research to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent advances in the practice of cancer prevention, cancer disparities have increased because the beneficial impact for vulnerable communities has been unrealized. A severely limited research base to inform dissemination practice has served as a major contributor to the uneven adoption of evidence-based interventions to promote health and prevent disease. As a result, minority and underserved communities suffer a disproportionate share of the national cancer burden. This application focuses on development of a conceptual model that will serve as the basis of developing a future program in dissemination research, related to reduction of cancer disparities. My research to date illustrates that I have developed a number of effective strategies to address cancer risk in diverse populations. The protected time provided by this award will permit me to focus on development of a conceptual framework that could guide my own and other's work related to dissemination and cancer disparities. This award would provide a critical opportunity for me to do the level of in-depth thinking and collaboration that is necessary to address the vexing problem of dissemination of effective cancer prevention interventions, particularly to populations facing persistent disparities. This award will also allow me to heighten and sustain my personal commitment to mentorship of promising new investigators. The focus of my mentoring to date has been largely with women and racial/ethnic minority group members, and I plan to continue to this focus in my future mentoring activities. The K05 award at this timely moment will heighten research productivity in the critical area of dissemination of cancer prevention and control, help foster the careers of many more dedicated cancer control scientists through my mentorship, and ultimately make an impact on reducing cancer disparities for the 21st century. The solid institutional commitment demonstrated for this protected time provides strong evidence of my ability to meet the proposed research and mentoring objectives.          ",Dissemination Research to Reduce Cancer Disparities,7499045,K05CA124415,"['Clinic ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' skills training ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' cost ', ' dissemination research ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' childhood cancer survivor ', ' pediatric cancer survivor ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' smoking intervention ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Low income ', ' Electronics ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Senior Scientist Award ', ' K05 Award ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Rate ', ' prescription document ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adoption ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Guidelines ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Housing ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Physical activity ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Fostering ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Oncologist ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' pediatric neoplasm/cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Patients ', ' prescription procedure ', ' Printing ', ' Productivity ', ' Condition ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K05,2008,160976,0.040124335077898955
"Loma Linda University Center for Health Disparities Res*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For a century, Loma Linda University (LLU) has played a major role in health care access and education in the Inland Empire (IE), California. For all these years LLU has supported the only medical and public health schools servicing a highly diverse community of more than three million people. The present application proposes a plan to establish the first Center for Health Disparities Research (CHDR) in the region. The five-year project proposes an innovative plan to integrate translational biomedical and community-based interdisciplinary research on health disparities with community based participatory research, partnerships for community outreach and education, and training and development of underrepresented scientists. The long-term goal of this application is to hasten the elimination of health disparities by the establishment of the LLUCHDR.

"Arkansas Cancer Community Network (ARCCN)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite cancer incidence rates that align with national averages, Arkansans suffer from the 12 highest cancer mortality rates in the US and severe disparities for breast, prostate, gynecological, and colorectal cancers.  Deeply ingrained demographic, access, and risk behavior factors contribute to these problems.  The proposed Arkansas Cancer Community Network (AR-CCN) seeks to build upon past experiences and accomplishments of the Arkansas Special Populations Access Network (ASPAN) to continue addressing these issues by bridging gaps from discovery to development and from development to delivery of appropriate interventions.  AR-CCN's ultimate purpose is to reduce health disparities at the local level by working with communities to: discover culturally competent methods to reduce disparities; measure disparity reduction; apply this information through dissemination and policy development; and sustain effective interventions at local, state, and possibly national levels by implementing policies and gaining support from varied sources.  AR-CCN's overall goal is to significantly improve access to and utilization of beneficial cancer interventions in communities with cancer health disparities, thereby reducing disparities.  The aims of the AR-CCN will further develop and increase capacity building that began with ASPAN, develop community-based participatory research and training programs, and establish credibility and create sustainability for productive local networks.  Backed by experienced leadership and staffing, AR-CCN will draw upon the expertise of multiple institutional and community partners, collaborations with NCI-related programs, and effective community interventions to support integrated community-based participatory activities, enhance and increase its partnerships and collaborations, increase use and integration of beneficial interventions, and increase leveraged non-CRCHD funds for community-based education, prevention, and screening activities to reduce cancer disparities.  CRCHD funding will enable the network to expand its training and preparation programs and develop additional pilot research projects to reduce cancer health disparities.  Experienced evaluators will determine reduction in cancer disparities at the community level while AR-CCN's team works to obtain non-CRCHD funding and provide evidence-based information to local, state, and federal decision and policy makers         ",Arkansas Cancer Community Network (ARCCN),7404430,U01CA114607,"['Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' development policy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Purpose ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Preparation ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Support of Research ', ' Prevention education ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Staging ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' programs ', ' Arkansas ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Work ', ' Source ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' Breast ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' community intervention ', ' Minority ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,U01,2008,967457,0.05151258846583415
"Hispanic Community Network to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hispanics are among the fastest growing population in the United States (US).   Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take advantage of cancer prevention activities than their non-Hispanic White counterparts.  Major concerns related to such under use are low socioeconomic status, lack of insurance, cultural values and norms, treatment options, and knowledge and beliefs concerning cancer.  Further, the Hispanic population as a whole has few mentors and researchers of Hispanic ethnicity to provide culturally appropriate role models for Hispanics to enter cancer research fields.  The overall goal of this proposed five year project is to work with community partners to reduce the cancer health disparities experienced by many Hispanics in a rural area.  We propose to build a Network, or infrastructure of community partners in the Yakima Valley.  With the partners we will promote cancer awareness and education in the Valley, establish a system to recruit minority students to work on cancer prevention projects, develop pilot research projects to address specific cancer disparities in the Valley, develop community research projects to increase cancer education among Hispanics, evaluate the success of the research projects, evaluate the intermediate effects of reducing cancer disparities, and sustain the Network by applying for at least one full-scale trial.   Each of the specific aims is targeted to occur in the three required phases of research.  Phase 1, mobilizing the community, will occur in the first year of the project and will continue throughout the remaining years as new partners join the collaboration and new tasks are selected for intervention.  We expect Phase 2, awareness and education activities, training activities, and pilot research projects to continue from years 02 through 05.  The last phase, Phase 3 will occur in Year 05 as we attempt to obtain independent funding to continue the work in the Valley.  An External Advisory Group will provide external feedback to the Network and Steering Committee of Network members will make decisions about the research, awareness, and education activities to be done.

"Dallas Cancer Disparities Coalition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant socioeconomic and racial cancer disparities are evident in the South Dallas/Fair Park area, a low socioeconomic, largely minority population in Dallas, Texas, with a cancer mortality rate approximately 1.5 times greater than that of Dallas County as a whole. Community-based participatory research (CBPR), a collaborative research approach that combines community needs assessment with community capacity-building strategies, is one method that has been successfully used for cancer-control research. The Trans-HHS Cancer Health Disparities Progress Review Group suggests that CBPR may be an ideal way to tackle cancer disparities in underserved populations, such as that of South Dallas. The objective of this study is to implement an effective CBPR approach to reduce the presence of cancer and cancer-related health behavior in this population. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to work collaboratively with the community to identify priority cancer disparities based on the results of a community diagnosis that explores behavioral, cultural, dietary, socioeconomic, and political determinants of these disparities and the strengths and assets of the South Dallas/Fair Park area to mitigate these factors; and (2) to develop innovative community-based intervention approaches to reduce and eliminate cancer disparities in the South Dallas/Fair Park area. Investigators and community members will create an advisory board to initiate dialogue regarding cancer disparities. The results of a recently conducted South Dallas Needs Assessment will be discussed in focus groups to identify factors contributing to cancer disparities in the community. Investigators will analyze the data from the needs assessment and focus groups and disseminate the results to the community. The advisory board will design an appropriate intervention, and the intervention will be pilot tested in the Frazier Courts area. The outcomes and processes of the intervention as well as the CBPR processes will be evaluated. This project is expected to contribute to the reduction of cancer in the South Dallas/Fair Park area by educating residents about the level of cancer and disparities in the community; identifying determinants of cancer in the community; and implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention. Furthermore, this project will support the National Cancer Institute's commitment to eliminate cancer disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cancer disparities are a major public health concern, as seen by the National Cancer Institute's commitment to eliminate cancer disparities. The goal of the Dallas Cancer Disparities Research Coalition is to reduce the presence of cancer in the South Dallas/Fair Park area by educating residents about the level of cancer and cancer disparities in their community, by identifying determinants of cancer in the community, and by implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of the collaborative intervention. This project will empower the community in the cancer battle by involving them in every step of the research process, thus making the community members more likely to participate and succeed in the recommended cancer-control strategies.

"ASIAN AMERICAN NETWORK FOR CANCER AWARENESS RESEARCH & TRAINING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The overall mission of the Asian American Network for Cancer Awareness, Research and Training (AANCART) is to reduce cancer health disparities by conducting community-based participatory education, training, and research by, for, and with Asian Americans in Sacramento, CA (also serves as Headquarters); San Francisco, CA; Los Angeles, CA; Seattle, WA; Hawaii (state); and Houston, TX.  This Network is a national one, comprised of seven NCI cancer centers and their associated universities, the California Department of Health Services, Chinese Community Health Care Association, and the Hmong Women's Heritage Association.  Cumulatively, this Network serves nearly 50 percent of all Asian Americans.  Consistent with RFA-CA-05-012, AANCART's deliverables are:  (1) Sustenance of a highly interactive Network among AANCART regions to catalyze cancer education for Asian Americans; (2) Establishment of research training programs that address Asian American cancer health disparities; and (3) Process and impact data to document the extent to which specific cancer health disparities are reduced among Cambodians, Chinese, Filipino, Hmong, Korean, and Vietnamese.  Examples of Asian American disparities to be addressed include those associated with smoking-related lung and hepatitis B-induced liver cancers, low breast and cervical cancer screening rates, and emerging cancer threats posed by acculturation, diet, and insufficient ethnically-specific representation in clinical trials. Aims will be achieved through both Network-wide and regional activities by the AANCART Steering Committee and involving Asian American-oriented community-based organizations, Cancer Information Service staff, and other supportive entities tied together through past histories of collaboration and memoranda of understanding and letters of support.  Universities associated with AANCART, the California Department of Health and the Chinese Community Health Plan are committed to additional support for AANCART.

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute at the University of South Florida, in collaboration with local community-based heath centers, social service agencies, faith-based groups, adult education and literacy groups, and local media will form the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TB-CCN).  This local network will aim to address critical access, prevention and control issues that impact medically underserved, low-literacy   and low-income populations in selected areas of Hillsborough, Pinellas and Pasco Counties.  This tri-county area is ethnically diverse and includes a growing number of foreign-born populations.  Meeting this goal will involve cancer awareness and education activities, the use of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods, and the creation of sustainable collaborations and partnerships.  The development of the network draws on the strengths of our existing community-academic partnerships, our considerable experience in developing innovative education and training programs that examine the nexus of culture and literacy across the continuum of cancer care, and community partners with a mutual goal of improved health.  Underlying theoretical principles that guide the development of our network include Freire's critical pedagogy and critical anthropology of health.  Specific aims are to:   1) Create a solid, robust and sustainable core organizational network infrastructure through collaborations, partnerships and community capacity building activities (Phase I):   2) Develop an Education and Training Hub for the delivery of innovative community-based participatory research, training and education (Phase II); and   3) Disseminate evidence-based information through traditional and community-based media (Phase III).

"Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Between 1992-2000 among all cancer types, liver cancer, with its 5-year survival rate of less than 10 percent, has the distinction of having the highest annual percent increase in incidence (3.9 percent), while the incidence for the majority of other cancers declined. The highest male incidence rate of liver cancer is among Vietnamese (41.8/100,000), and the highest female incidence is among Koreans (10.0/100,000); for Hmong, the male incidence rate of 25.7/100,000 and the female incidence rate of 8.8/100,000 is intermediate between these other two groups. By contrast, the comparable incidence rates for non-Hispanic White incidence are substantially less: (male, 3.7/100,000; female, 1.5/100,000). These rates indicate that hepatitis-B related liver cancer represents the most drastic cancer health disparity affecting Asian Americans. Each of these 3 Asian groups will be the focus of this P01 entitled, ""Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans."" This P01 is comprised of 3 projects: #1 ""Promoting Hepatitis B Screening for Vietnamese Adults""; #2 ""Community-based Hep B Interventions for Hmong Adults""; and #3 ""Increasing Hep B Screening Among Korean Church Attendees."" Synergy among these projects is exemplified by: having all projects focused on the same dependent variable: increasing hepatitis B serological testing rates among adults, ages 18-64; using the Health Behavior Framework; having interventions that compare effects between intervention and control conditions; having research leaders who have worked over 5 years together through the NCI's Asian American Network for Cancer Awareness Research and Training; and 2 supporting cores:  Biostatistics, and Methodology. Our goals are to: (1) Conduct community-based research interventions, focused on reducing hepatitis B-induced liver cancer morbidity and mortality within these 3 Asian American populations; (2) Analyze data and lessons across projects; and (3) Report progress and share findings with the NCI, ethnic leaders, populations-at-risk and professional audiences. If these goals and the specific aims of each of these three projects are achieved, we expect the relevance of this research to public health to include the first empirically derived data on the effectiveness of community based interventions to reduce hepatitis B-induced liver cancer mortality.           ",Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans,7689285,P01CA109091,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P01,2009,1424275,0.05685013949673395

"Identifying Disparities in Type 2 Diabetes Among Asian Americans: The Pan Asian C    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the Asian American population has grown dramatically in size and diversity in recent decades, there are wide gaps in our knowledge of health and healthcare for this population. Asian subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) are often aggregated in clinical and population-based studies because of small numbers in any one subgroup. In particular, data are lacking on Type 2 diabetes and obesity for Asian Americans, suggested to have increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. Moreover, no data explains whether this applies equally for all Asian American subgroups. The prevalence of obesity, pre-diabetes, diabetes and the diabetic complications of diabetes are largely unknown in specific Asian subgroups. There is also a controversy about how obesity should be defined for Asians. In 2004, the World Health Organization recommended lower body mass index (BMI) cut points to define overweight and obesity for people of Asian descent worldwide. However the evidence on which this is based is debatable, and it is possible that this association will be different in Asian subgroups living in the U.S. It is also unknown if risk factors for diabetes are similarly predictive for Asian American subgroups and Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Better information is needed concerning screening, incidence, prevalence, risk factors, natural history of obesity and diabetes, and healthcare and patient factors that affect treatment disparities for Asian American subgroups. This application aims to examine diabetes screening, risk and care both to fill gaps in knowledge of diabetes disparities and to inform clinical decision making regarding screening and healthcare for Asian Americans. We propose to construct a mixed historical and prospective longitudinal cohort by linking existing clinical databases in a large (20,000), multiethnic sample of contemporary Asians in California. We will define Asian subgroups through self-report, and will include a sample of NHWs for comparison. Use of electronic health records in this epidemiologic study will allow highly cost efficient assembly and follow-up of this cohort. The overall goal of this application is to address a substantial gap in existing knowledge regarding diabetes risk in Asian racial/ethnic minorities. This study will provide a greater understanding of diabetes among Asian ethnic minorities in a comparable environment, and would contribute both to a global understanding of risk for Asian populations and to more targeted research, public health and clinical efforts throughout the U.S.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Limited information is available about diabetes among Asians, one of the nation's fastest growing minority groups. The overall goal of this application is to address a substantial gap in existing knowledge about diabetes in Asians.

"Dallas Cancer Disparities Coalition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant socioeconomic and racial cancer disparities are evident in the South Dallas/Fair Park area, a low socioeconomic, largely minority population in Dallas, Texas, with a cancer mortality rate approximately 1.5 times greater than that of Dallas County as a whole. Community-based participatory research (CBPR), a collaborative research approach that combines community needs assessment with community capacity-building strategies, is one method that has been successfully used for cancer-control research. The Trans-HHS Cancer Health Disparities Progress Review Group suggests that CBPR may be an ideal way to tackle cancer disparities in underserved populations, such as that of South Dallas. The objective of this study is to implement an effective CBPR approach to reduce the presence of cancer and cancer-related health behavior in this population. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to work collaboratively with the community to identify priority cancer disparities based on the results of a community diagnosis that explores behavioral, cultural, dietary, socioeconomic, and political determinants of these disparities and the strengths and assets of the South Dallas/Fair Park area to mitigate these factors; and (2) to develop innovative community-based intervention approaches to reduce and eliminate cancer disparities in the South Dallas/Fair Park area. Investigators and community members will create an advisory board to initiate dialogue regarding cancer disparities. The results of a recently conducted South Dallas Needs Assessment will be discussed in focus groups to identify factors contributing to cancer disparities in the community. Investigators will analyze the data from the needs assessment and focus groups and disseminate the results to the community. The advisory board will design an appropriate intervention, and the intervention will be pilot tested in the Frazier Courts area. The outcomes and processes of the intervention as well as the CBPR processes will be evaluated. This project is expected to contribute to the reduction of cancer in the South Dallas/Fair Park area by educating residents about the level of cancer and disparities in the community; identifying determinants of cancer in the community; and implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention. Furthermore, this project will support the National Cancer Institute's commitment to eliminate cancer disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cancer disparities are a major public health concern, as seen by the National Cancer Institute's commitment to eliminate cancer disparities. The goal of the Dallas Cancer Disparities Research Coalition is to reduce the presence of cancer in the South Dallas/Fair Park area by educating residents about the level of cancer and cancer disparities in their community, by identifying determinants of cancer in the community, and by implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of the collaborative intervention. This project will empower the community in the cancer battle by involving them in every step of the research process, thus making the community members more likely to participate and succeed in the recommended cancer-control strategies.          ",Dallas Cancer Disparities Coalition,7637927,R21CA126732,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Health Sciences ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Progress Review Group ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Behavioral ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' court ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Physical activity ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' County ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Actions ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R21,2009,152150,0.07047120867940292
"P.L.A.N.E.T. MassCONECT to Promote Evidence-Based Interventions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community partnerships provide a key vehicle for dissemination of evidence-based interventions to promote cancer prevention. Despite fundamental advances in the development of evidence-based interventions, there are significant gaps in translation of this knowledge. In particular, little is known about the barriers faced by community groups in adopting successful evidence-based interventions and how dissemination can be accomplished in community settings. Even less is known about the adoption of these interventions by groups working with the underserved. The goal of our proposed project is to test a community participatory model for dissemination of evidence- based cancer prevention interventions by combining the elements of a national resource, the Cancer Control PLANET, and our close collaborative relationships with community partners developed through MassCONECT, a NCI-funded Community Network Program intervening to reduce cancer disparities in three Massachusetts communities: Boston, Lawrence & Worcester. Using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles as the central guiding framework, we will promote the adoption of our intervention called PLANET MassCONECT, a web portal that adopts the national resource to local conditions. This community participatory model includes several key steps: (1) to seek community input from the Community Project Advisory Committee (C-PAC) and through formative research to assess community- specific factors influencing adoption of the PLANET; and (2) establish a dedicated, customized web portal, PLANET MassCONECT, that presents useable information organized to prevent information overload. To test the model, we will examine if the provision of three types of capital } human capital (community health educators serving as technical resources and workshops to train community members), social capital (communications among potential users leading to social capital), and financial capital (modest infrastructure support and pilot intervention grants) } will increase the organizational capacity to plan, adopt and implement evidence-based cancer control interventions in communities of three different sizes and structures. The outcomes of interest are collective efficacy, use of PLANET MassCONECT, PLANET reach, program planning and program adoption. We plan to disseminate the intervention, if successful, using two national cancer prevention networks funded by NCI and CDC, NCI's Cancer Information Service and the American Cancer Society. This study builds from a solid foundation of collaboration among community, academic and national partners to advance our understanding of dissemination of evidence-based interventions through community-based participatory approach.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of PLANET MassCONECT is to design and test a model of dissemination of evidenced-based cancer-control interventions for adoption by community groups who serve the underserved in three Massachusetts communities - Boston, Lawrence, and Worcester. From research on health interventions, we know much about what should be done to promote health and prevent diseases, yet know little about how to translate those interventions into real world settings. The PLANET MassCONECT study will follow a community participatory model, allowing us to address the many barriers to successful dissemination, and is focused on building community capacity to ensure sustainability.

"Dissemination Research to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent advances in the practice of cancer prevention, cancer disparities have increased because the beneficial impact for vulnerable communities has been unrealized. A severely limited research base to inform dissemination practice has served as a major contributor to the uneven adoption of evidence-based interventions to promote health and prevent disease. As a result, minority and underserved communities suffer a disproportionate share of the national cancer burden. This application focuses on development of a conceptual model that will serve as the basis of developing a future program in dissemination research, related to reduction of cancer disparities. My research to date illustrates that I have developed a number of effective strategies to address cancer risk in diverse populations. The protected time provided by this award will permit me to focus on development of a conceptual framework that could guide my own and other's work related to dissemination and cancer disparities. This award would provide a critical opportunity for me to do the level of in-depth thinking and collaboration that is necessary to address the vexing problem of dissemination of effective cancer prevention interventions, particularly to populations facing persistent disparities. This award will also allow me to heighten and sustain my personal commitment to mentorship of promising new investigators. The focus of my mentoring to date has been largely with women and racial/ethnic minority group members, and I plan to continue to this focus in my future mentoring activities. The K05 award at this timely moment will heighten research productivity in the critical area of dissemination of cancer prevention and control, help foster the careers of many more dedicated cancer control scientists through my mentorship, and ultimately make an impact on reducing cancer disparities for the 21st century.

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute at the University of South Florida, in collaboration with local community-based heath centers, social service agencies, faith-based groups, adult education and literacy groups, and local media will form the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TB-CCN).  This local network will aim to address critical access, prevention and control issues that impact medically underserved, low-literacy   and low-income populations in selected areas of Hillsborough, Pinellas and Pasco Counties.  This tri-county area is ethnically diverse and includes a growing number of foreign-born populations.  Meeting this goal will involve cancer awareness and education activities, the use of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods, and the creation of sustainable collaborations and partnerships.  The development of the network draws on the strengths of our existing community-academic partnerships, our considerable experience in developing innovative education and training programs that examine the nexus of culture and literacy across the continuum of cancer care, and community partners with a mutual goal of improved health.  Underlying theoretical principles that guide the development of our network include Freire's critical pedagogy and critical anthropology of health.  Specific aims are to:   1) Create a solid, robust and sustainable core organizational network infrastructure through collaborations, partnerships and community capacity building activities (Phase I):   2) Develop an Education and Training Hub for the delivery of innovative community-based participatory research, training and education (Phase II); and   3) Disseminate evidence-based information through traditional and community-based media (Phase III).   Project evaluation will include both process and outcome evaluations according to each phase.  The overall success of the TB-CCN will be evaluated by the achievement of a sustainable network for education; research and diffusion of information as assessed by the creation of a solid sustainable infrastructure, development of relevant education and training activities, increased access and utilizations of screening services, generation of research proposals and other unique applications of knowledge.

Investigators and community members will create an advisory board to initiate dialogue regarding cancer disparities. The results of a recently conducted South Dallas Needs Assessment will be discussed in focus groups to identify factors contributing to cancer disparities in the community. Investigators will analyze the data from the needs assessment and focus groups and disseminate the results to the community. The advisory board will design an appropriate intervention, and the intervention will be pilot tested in the Frazier Courts area. The outcomes and processes of the intervention as well as the CBPR processes will be evaluated. This project is expected to contribute to the reduction of cancer in the South Dallas/Fair Park area by educating residents about the level of cancer and disparities in the community; identifying determinants of cancer in the community; and implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention. Furthermore, this project will support the National Cancer Institute's commitment to eliminate cancer disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cancer disparities are a major public health concern, as seen by the National Cancer Institute's commitment to eliminate cancer disparities. The goal of the Dallas Cancer Disparities Research Coalition is to reduce the presence of cancer in the South Dallas/Fair Park area by educating residents about the level of cancer and cancer disparities in their community, by identifying determinants of cancer in the community, and by implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of the collaborative intervention. This project will empower the community in the cancer battle by involving them in every step of the research process, thus making the community members more likely to participate and succeed in the recommended cancer-control strategies.

"Identifying Disparities in Type 2 Diabetes Among Asian Americans: The Pan Asian C    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The revision to the parent grant, 5 R01 DK081371-02: ""Identifying Disparities in Type 2 Diabetes Among Asian Americans: The Pan Asian Cohort Study,"" is in response to NOT-OD-09-058: ""NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications."" The parent grant is funded from January 15, 2009 - December 31, 2013 in response to Program Announcement PA-07-388: ""Identifying and Reducing Diabetes and Obesity Related Health Disparities within Healthcare Systems (R01)."" This five-year study addresses the lack of knowledge regarding type 2 diabetes and obesity in Asian Americans, both as an aggregate group and as distinct subgroups. Relatively little is known about how Asian subgroups differ in type 2 diabetes riskfactors and complications when compared to the Non-Hispanic White population, for which numerous study findings have informed both practice of care and public health efforts in the United States. The parent grant utilizes a mixed historical and prospective longitudinal cohort to address these research questions of significant public health import, linking existing clinical databases to construct a large (140,000 Asian adults) cohort of a multiethnic sample of contemporary Asians in California. The revision, a two-year study, aims to additionally compare the effectiveness of oral drugs for treatment of type 2 diabetes among Asian subgroups in the same electronically linked cohort. It is well-known that type 2 diabetes manifests differently in race/ethnic groups, and that race/ethnic groups respond differently to the same pharmacotherapy. Treatment options for type 2 diabetes are numerous, and previous studies have demonstrated differences in metabolic responses to certain oral drugs according to race/ethnicity. This creates a need for more race/ethnic specific data comparing the effects of medication use to be able to improve diabetes care in Asian Americans in the United States. The wealth of real-life data captured within the clinical cohort will be utilized to compare the effectiveness of oral drugs to treat type 2 diabetes among Asian subgroups and to study existing preferences for certain drugs among patients and physicians. Predictors of initial choice of oral drug (in physicians and patients), intermediate and long-term effectiveness of existing oral drugs on type 2 diabetes and its complications, and the cost-effectiveness of these therapies will be investigated under this competitive revision. This revision will contribute valuable knowledge for physicians, patients, and public health advocates on the clinical and cost effectiveness of various oral type 2diabetes therapies in Asian Americans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asian Americans (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes. There is no data on comparative effectiveness of oral drugs to treat type 2 diabetes in Asian American subgroups. Our study will address this gap in knowledge.                             Project Narrative Asian Americans (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes.

"ATECAR: Asian Training, Education on Cancer & Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Asian Americans represent the fastest growing ethnic group in the US.  In PA and NJ, the increase was 75 percent, comprising nearly 12 percent of PA's and more than 8 percent of NJ's populations.  In NY, Asians comprise 6.2 percent of the state's population.  A large subset of this multicultural population is poorly educated, medically uninsured and severely underserved.  As a group, Asians suffer inordinately high rates of cervical, breast, stomach, prostate, colorectal and hepatitis-B-related liver cancers.  While high rates of smoking contribute substantially to elevated rates of lung, esophageal and laryngeal cancers among males, the pervasiveness of secondhand smoke in Asian homes contributes significantly to high rates of these cancers among nonsmoker family members who share the same dwelling.  Specifically, both Asian American men and women have higher incidence and mortality rates of liver cancer than other ethnic groups in the U.S. Lung cancer remains a leading cause of death for Asian males and females and is highest among Vietnamese.  Mortality rates for breast cancer are high among Chinese women.  Vietnamese women have the highest rates of cervical cancer among ethnic groups in the US.  The cancer health disparity gap between Asians and mainstream populations is well documented, requiring a robust and vigorous intervention to ameliorate.  This proposal addresses four major ethnic groups residing in the eastern region of the US:  Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese and Cambodians, of whom more than 60 percent are recent immigrants.  The proposal goals and objectives are based on 5-years of ATECAR-SPN experience with Asian communities in this region and are supported by an elaborate system of experienced community-based partners, academic and research institutions and facilities, bilingual and multi-ethnic professional researchers and trainers and an extensive record of research publications on a range of cancer health disparity issues.  The primary goal of the proposed project is to establish a wider ATECAR Community Network (CN) and will work collaboratively to reduce cancer health disparities through innovative education, research and training strategies.  To accomplish this goal, we will undertake three aims in three phases.  Under Aim I, we plan to maintain and increase capacity building to support community-based participatory education, research, and training to reduce cancer health disparities in the Asian American populations (5 major objectives and 11 sub-objectives are proposed); Aim II, develop and implement community-based participatory research and training programs to reduce cancer health disparities in Asian American populations (3 major objectives and 11 sub-objectives are proposed); and Aim III, establish credibility and sustainability of ATECAR CN programs that reduce cancer health disparities (3 major objectives and 2 sub-objectives are proposed)         ","ATECAR: Asian Training, Education on Cancer & Research",7623241,U01CA114582,"['Needs Assessment ', ' Training and Education ', '

"(MASS CONECT) Mass. Community Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The Massachusetts Community Networks to Eliminate Cancer Disparities through Education, Research, and Training (MASS CONECT) is a comprehensive program initiative that will uniquely unite the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and the Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) with multiple community partners in three urban Massachusetts communities of low socioeconomic position (SEP).   MASS CONECT will advance cancer education, community-based participatory research (CBPR), training (for junior faculty, grassroots leaders, and the media), and services for low SEP minority populations in Massachusetts.   The three communities are Boston and Worcester (the two largest cities in New England), and Lawrence (the poorest city in New England).   In these communities, MASS CONECT will unite key partners, including major policy makers, to develop effective ways to reduce cancer disparities.   Our specific aims are to intervene in each of these low SEP Massachusetts communities to improve data on community-level cancer disparities (using formative research on community perceptions of cancer disparities data and also geocoding and mapping techniques); provide leadership, cancer education, and training through respected community coalitions; educate and train local media to increase their coverage of stories on cancer disparities; promote access to key cancer control and treatment services through a prevention and clinical services core; provide needs assessments that will lead to a community-specific plan to address gaps (including identifying policy opportunities to overcome barriers to optimal cancer control and treatment); evaluate outcomes related to cancer disparities in the three target communities (including outcomes relevant to prevention and screening, disparities research, and coverage of cancer disparities in the media); and establish relationships with NCI's Division of Cancer Control and Populations Sciences and the NCI Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities         ",(MASS CONECT) Mass.

"Asian American Center on Disparities Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application establishes the Asian American Center on Disparities Research (AACDR). AACDR builds upon a program of research on the mental health issues of Asian American populations that had been carried on since 1988 by the National Research Center on Asian American Mental Health (NRCAAMH). AACDR pursues a research agenda that investigates how cultural factors work to either enhance or mitigate the implementation and effectiveness of evidence-based treatments for Asian American clients.  The center's objectives are to (1) conduct programmatic, problem-oriented research toward the empirical testing of effective clinical   treatments for Asian American populations; (2) conduct research that has theoretical and policy significance for Asian Americans in particular and the mental health field in general; (3) promote and conduct research that addresses key methodological issues involved in the study of diversity and disparities; (4) be the focal point and stimulus for researchers conducting Asian American disparities research on a national level by maintaining and enhancing a network of researchers, service providers, and policy makers to facilitate theory and methodology development; and (5) bridge science into mental health practice, in particular, concerning cultural influences that affect critical problems of treatment and service delivery such as medical non-adherence and premature dropout. The center's Clinical Effectiveness Research Program tests the effectiveness of evidence-based treatments for depression for Asian American clients and identifies the cultural variables that moderate the effects of these interventions. The Therapist Factors Research Program determines if therapist characteristics associated with cultural competence and the use of evidence-based practices interact or independently affect treatment outcomes for mental health outpatient clients. The Medication Adherence Research Program develops and tests the effectiveness of a culturally targeted intervention designed to improve medication adherence among depressed Asian American clients.  Disparities in health care refer to the differential treatment of patients on the basis of race or ethnicity that is not explained by underlying health conditions or treatment preferences of patients (Institute of Medicine, 2002). Since 1978, various presidential commissions have concluded that the disparities were not so much due to racial and ethnic differences in rates of psychopathology but were due to inaccessible and ineffective treatment. Thus, one critical task is to improve therapeutic effectiveness and quality of care for these clients. Essentially, the center's research mission is devoted to and focused on this latter aspect of disparity-cultural factors that affect the effectiveness of treatment.          ",Asian American Center on Disparities Research,7643783,P50MH073511,[''],NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P50,2009,760235,0.02717673204867956

"ATECAR: Asian Training, Education on Cancer & Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Asian Americans represent the fastest growing ethnic group in the US.  In PA and NJ, the increase was 75 percent, comprising nearly 12 percent of PA's and more than 8 percent of NJ's populations.  In NY, Asians comprise 6.2 percent of the state's population.  A large subset of this multicultural population is poorly educated, medically uninsured and severely underserved.  As a group, Asians suffer inordinately high rates of cervical, breast, stomach, prostate, colorectal and hepatitis-B-related liver cancers.  While high rates of smoking contribute substantially to elevated rates of lung, esophageal and laryngeal cancers among males, the pervasiveness of secondhand smoke in Asian homes contributes significantly to high rates of these cancers among nonsmoker family members who share the same dwelling.  Specifically, both Asian American men and women have higher incidence and mortality rates of liver cancer than other ethnic groups in the U.S. Lung cancer remains a leading cause of death for Asian males and females and is highest among Vietnamese.  Mortality rates for breast cancer are high among Chinese women.  Vietnamese women have the highest rates of cervical cancer among ethnic groups in the US.  The cancer health disparity gap between Asians and mainstream populations is well documented, requiring a robust and vigorous intervention to ameliorate.  This proposal addresses four major ethnic groups residing in the eastern region of the US:  Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese and Cambodians, of whom more than 60 percent are recent immigrants.  The proposal goals and objectives are based on 5-years of ATECAR-SPN experience with Asian communities in this region and are supported by an elaborate system of experienced community-based partners, academic and research institutions and facilities, bilingual and multi-ethnic professional researchers and trainers and an extensive record of research publications on a range of cancer health disparity issues.  The primary goal of the proposed project is to establish a wider ATECAR Community Network (CN) and will work collaboratively to reduce cancer health disparities through innovative education, research and training strategies.  To accomplish this goal, we will undertake three aims in three phases.  Under Aim I, we plan to maintain and increase capacity building to support community-based participatory education, research, and training to reduce cancer health disparities in the Asian American populations (5 major objectives and 11 sub-objectives are proposed); Aim II, develop and implement community-based participatory research and training programs to reduce cancer health disparities in Asian American populations (3 major objectives and 11 sub-objectives are proposed); and Aim III, establish credibility and sustainability of ATECAR CN programs that reduce cancer health disparities (3 major objectives and 2 sub-objectives are proposed)         ","ATECAR: Asian Training, Education on Cancer & Research",7931474,U01CA114582,"['Caring ', ' Breast Cancer Education ', ' Doctor of

"Hispanic Community Network to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hispanics are among the fastest growing population in the United States (US).   Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take advantage of cancer prevention activities than their non-Hispanic White counterparts.  Major concerns related to such under use are low socioeconomic status, lack of insurance, cultural values and norms, treatment options, and knowledge and beliefs concerning cancer.  Further, the Hispanic population as a whole has few mentors and researchers of Hispanic ethnicity to provide culturally appropriate role models for Hispanics to enter cancer research fields.  The overall goal of this proposed five year project is to work with community partners to reduce the cancer health disparities experienced by many Hispanics in a rural area.  We propose to build a Network, or infrastructure of community partners in the Yakima Valley.  With the partners we will promote cancer awareness and education in the Valley, establish a system to recruit minority students to work on cancer prevention projects, develop pilot research projects to address specific cancer disparities in the Valley, develop community research projects to increase cancer education among Hispanics, evaluate the success of the research projects, evaluate the intermediate effects of reducing cancer disparities, and sustain the Network by applying for at least one full-scale trial.   Each of the specific aims is targeted to occur in the three required phases of research.  Phase 1, mobilizing the community, will occur in the first year of the project and will continue throughout the remaining years as new partners join the collaboration and new tasks are selected for intervention.  We expect Phase 2, awareness and education activities, training activities, and pilot research projects to continue from years 02 through 05.  The last phase, Phase 3 will occur in Year 05 as we attempt to obtain independent funding to continue the work in the Valley.  An External Advisory Group will provide external feedback to the Network and Steering Committee of Network members will make decisions about the research, awareness, and education activities to be done.

"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In Phase I of the South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network (SCCDCN), the overall goal is to develop and increase capacity to support community-based participatory education, research, and training to reduce cancer health disparities among African Americans in South Carolina.  Research activities focus on establishing an infrastructure including multidisciplinary professionals, primary community partners (Baptist Education and Missionary Convention and South Carolina Primary Health Care Association), and secondary partners and collaborators.  Organizations and individuals involved in this process will determine priorities for addressing cancer health disparities through a faith-based approach.  Further, Phase I activities will include working with community partners to collect baseline data, provide cancer education, and seek funding to support pilot research projects developed in concert with community partners.  An essential component of all phases will be dissemination to community partners and the larger African American community to ensure the researchers are addressing community interests related to cancer health disparities.  The goal of Phase II of the SCCDCN is to actually implement community-based participatory research education, and training programs to reduce cancer health disparities.  Research activities in this phase focus on initiating at least two pilot community-based participatory research projects with BEMC congregations, developing additional projects for future implementation, constructing a strategic plan for recruiting and training researchers and community practitioners to conduct cancer health disparities research, and evaluating programmatic and project-specific activities.

"Identifying Disparities in Type 2 Diabetes Among Asian Americans: The Pan Asian C    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the Asian American population has grown dramatically in size and diversity in recent decades, there are wide gaps in our knowledge of health and healthcare for this population. Asian subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) are often aggregated in clinical and population-based studies because of small numbers in any one subgroup. In particular, data are lacking on Type 2 diabetes and obesity for Asian Americans, suggested to have increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. Moreover, no data explains whether this applies equally for all Asian American subgroups. The prevalence of obesity, pre-diabetes, diabetes and the diabetic complications of diabetes are largely unknown in specific Asian subgroups. There is also a controversy about how obesity should be defined for Asians. In 2004, the World Health Organization recommended lower body mass index (BMI) cut points to define overweight and obesity for people of Asian descent worldwide. However the evidence on which this is based is debatable, and it is possible that this association will be different in Asian subgroups living in the U.S. It is also unknown if risk factors for diabetes are similarly predictive for Asian American subgroups and Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Better information is needed concerning screening, incidence, prevalence, risk factors, natural history of obesity and diabetes, and healthcare and patient factors that affect treatment disparities for Asian American subgroups. This application aims to examine diabetes screening, risk and care both to fill gaps in knowledge of diabetes disparities and to inform clinical decision making regarding screening and healthcare for Asian Americans. We propose to construct a mixed historical and prospective longitudinal cohort by linking existing clinical databases in a large (20,000), multiethnic sample of contemporary Asians in California. We will define Asian subgroups through self-report, and will include a sample of NHWs for comparison. Use of electronic health records in this epidemiologic study will allow highly cost efficient assembly and follow-up of this cohort. The overall goal of this application is to address a substantial gap in existing knowledge regarding diabetes risk in Asian racial/ethnic minorities. This study will provide a greater understanding of diabetes among Asian ethnic minorities in a comparable environment, and would contribute both to a global understanding of risk for Asian populations and to more targeted research, public health and clinical efforts throughout the U.S.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Limited information is available about diabetes among Asians, one of the nation's fastest growing minority groups.

"Asian American Liver Cancer Education Program in  Maryland    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for over half of the 1.3 million chronic Hepatitis B cases and deaths from Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the U.S. This excess risk can be attributed to high rates of HBV infection (particularly among first generation immigrants), in combination with low rates of HBV screening and vaccination due to cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers. Because of these combined risk factors, Asian Americans are often diagnosed with late stage cancer, resulting in low survival rates and high mortality rates.       In response to this cancer-related health disparity, this project seeks to develop and implement educational programs to promote HBV screening and increase awareness of liver cancer prevention of Asian Americans in Maryland. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop educational strategies tailored to the needs of target communities to increase public awareness of liver cancer prevention; 2) Implement theory-driven and culturally integrated community-based cancer intervention programs; and 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention on hepatitis B and liver cancer awareness and HBV screening behavior.       Using a randomized control design, a total 900 Asian Americans (300 Vietnamese, Koreans, and Chinese each) age 18 and older will be recruited from 12 community-based organizations (CBO). Each CBO will be randomly assigned to either an intervention (n=6) or control group (n=6). Eligible participants will complete a survey and those in the intervention groups will participate in an educational program. An immediate post survey will be issued to examine the effects of the intervention on intention to obtain HBV screening. Participants will be telephone interviewed 6 months after the intervention to assess actual screening practice. Those in the control group will receive a delayed intervention after the posttest. The insights gained from this proposed liver cancer education program will be valuable in implementing cancer intervention programs for other high risk non-English speaking populations, including economically disadvantaged minorities and will address health disparities in immigrant populations.             ",Asian American Liver Cancer Education Program in  Maryland,7676219,R25CA129042,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Intention ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Solid ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Maryland ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' North America ', ' Koreans ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Simian B disease ', ' Simian B virus infection ', ' Simian B disorder ', ' Herpesvirus B infection ', ' Herpes simiae infection ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Awareness ', ' Country ', ' Hepatitis B Vaccination ', ' Hepatitis B series immunization ', ' Hepatitis B injection ', ' Hepatitis B immunization ', ' Hep B vaccination ', ' Behavior ', ' Chronic Hepatitis B ', ' chronic hepatitis B virus infection ', ' chronic HBV infection ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Korean American ', ' intervention program ', ' liver cancer prevention ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Generations ', ' Chinese American ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' eligible participant ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R25,2009,277522,0.056331091226951076
"American Indian and Latino Community Ambassadors to Cancer Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective cancer research programs often rely on a collaborative network of community and academic organizations, following the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR). CBPR can be defined as ""a partnership approach to research that equitably involves, for example, community members, organizational representatives, and researchers in all aspects of the research process and in which all partners contribute expertise and share decision making and ownership"". 1 Much successful CBPR work has been done to reduce cancer-related health disparities, yet no single, transferable model of CBPR that identifies specific ways for community members to participate in each stage of research exists. We propose the development of a CBPR model through a collaborative effort among cancer researchers at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) Cancer Center's Community Engagement Core and community members. This new core has developed through the union of two successful CBPR teams with the American Indian and Latino communities. The model will be developed through the pilot testing of a oneyear curriculum, Community Ambassadors to Cancer Research, and accompanying interactive web site that will educate community members about research while simultaneously educating researchers about the needs of the community. The primary goal of this project is to bring community members and researchers together to create a transferable model of CBPR with community involvement at each step of the research process. This will ensure a strong Community Engagement Core at the KUMC Cancer Center and allow us to create CBPR teams that can effectively compete for extramural grants. Ten competitively chosen community members will meet for two weeklong sessions at KUMC in months 1 and 12 of the program and 10 monthly oneday sessions held alternately at each of our community-based sites, the Heart of America Indian Center and el Centro, Inc. At each session, a researcher will present a part of the research process and a community leader will present a cancerrelated issue of importance to the community. Researchers and community members will then work together to determine the CBPR model for that stage of research. In addition, throughout the program researchers and community members with similar interests will be introduced to facilitate the formation of CBPR teams. We anticipate forming at least one new CBPR team that will be able to effectively submit for extramural funding within 6 months of program completion. In between sessions, participants and researchers will work together through an interactive web site. To determine effectiveness of program components, participants will complete preand posttesting on each step of the research process. We also plan a thorough process evaluation to determine strengths and weaknesses of the program. At program completion, we will have a transferable model of CBPR to present to both researchers and community members which will serve as the basis for the new Community Engagement Core of the KUMC Cancer Center.           ",American Indian and Latino Community Ambassadors to Cancer Research,7692211,R03CA139568,"['Credentialing ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heart ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Kansas ', ' Learning ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Trust ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Americas ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Motivation ', ' Community Networks ', ' Ownership ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Staging ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Certification ', ' Medical Research ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' model development ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' forging ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' shared decision making ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Medical center ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2009,80850,0.007493055545041392
"Hispanic Community Network to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hispanics are among the fastest growing population in the United States (US).   Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take advantage of cancer prevention activities than their non-Hispanic White counterparts.  Major concerns related to such under use are low socioeconomic status, lack of insurance, cultural values and norms, treatment options, and knowledge and beliefs concerning cancer.  Further, the Hispanic population as a whole has few mentors and researchers of Hispanic ethnicity to provide culturally appropriate role models for Hispanics to enter cancer research fields.  The overall goal of this proposed five year project is to work with community partners to reduce the cancer health disparities experienced by many Hispanics in a rural area.  We propose to build a Network, or infrastructure of community partners in the Yakima Valley.  With the partners we will promote cancer awareness and education in the Valley, establish a system to recruit minority students to work on cancer prevention projects, develop pilot research projects to address specific cancer disparities in the Valley, develop community research projects to increase cancer education among Hispanics, evaluate the success of the research projects, evaluate the intermediate effects of reducing cancer disparities, and sustain the Network by applying for at least one full-scale trial.   Each of the specific aims is targeted to occur in the three required phases of research.  Phase 1, mobilizing the community, will occur in the first year of the project and will continue throughout the remaining years as new partners join the collaboration and new tasks are selected for intervention.  We expect Phase 2, awareness and education activities, training activities, and pilot research projects to continue from years 02 through 05.  The last phase, Phase 3 will occur in Year 05 as we attempt to obtain independent funding to continue the work in the Valley.  An External Advisory Group will provide external feedback to the Network and Steering Committee of Network members will make decisions about the research, awareness, and education activities to be done.

"HORIZON Center: Healthy Options, Research, Interventions & Community Organizing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass Boston) and Harvard University School of Public Health (HSPH) have partnered with the Cherishing Our Hearts and Souls Coalition (COHS) of Roxbury (a Boston neighborhood comprised of 51% African Americans and 23% Hispanics) to establish an exploratory Center (P20) for Health and Health Care Disparities that is dedicated to Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR). The Healthy Options, Research, Interventions & Community Organizing Center (HORIZON Center) will: 1) conduct health disparities related research projects in partnership with COHS, 2) offer research training, with an emphasis in CBPR, to faculty, students, and community stakeholders, and 3) build a neighborhood based infrastructure that can partner with academic institutions in Boston to research and implement ""best practices"" in CBPR and academic-community partnerships. UMass Boston was designated a minority-serving institution by the National Cancer Institute and is the lead partner in the HORIZON Center. The diverse characteristics and strengths reflected in both academic institutions and in the six-year old community coalition (COHS) set the stage for significant changes in cultural norms (public knowledge, attitudes and behaviors) and professional practices surrounding research activities and academic community partnerships. The implications of successfully engaging a diverse urban underserved community in health promotion activities, in research and in advancing the cause of research are nationally significant. We partner to further the research mission of COHS and its Community Research Advisory Board (CRAB). The HORIZON Center has 4 cores, 3 research projects and 6 pilot projects; all designed to strengthen the evidence-based practices and strategies for understanding and training practitioners in health disparities reduction. We propose to increase the number of local agencies, community organizations and residents that contribute to and participate in research, training, health promotion, and community organizing activities. The cores provide an infrastructure and process for the translation of research into innovative community outreach strategies, educational interventions and public policy initiatives. The Administrative Core provides overall support to the HORIZON Center by coordinating the other cores and projects. The Research Core supports the research projects which are investigating the behavioral, social, and biological sciences related to health disparities. The Community Engagement Core is responsible for projects that investigate the best practices for outreach and mobilization in an urban community. The Training Core is responsible for projects that implement and evaluate strategies for increasing the number of people who are trained and engaged in CBPR and from health disparity populations.          ","HORIZON Center: Healthy Options, Research, Interventions & Community Organizing",7864274,P20MD002290,[''],NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,P20,2010,2134484,-0.0009220843537467445
"Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Between 1992-2000 among all cancer types, liver cancer, with its 5-year survival rate of less than 10 percent, has the distinction of having the highest annual percent increase in incidence (3.9 percent), while the incidence for the majority of other cancers declined. The highest male incidence rate of liver cancer is among Vietnamese (41.8/100,000), and the highest female incidence is among Koreans (10.0/100,000); for Hmong, the male incidence rate of 25.7/100,000 and the female incidence rate of 8.8/100,000 is intermediate between these other two groups. By contrast, the comparable incidence rates for non-Hispanic White incidence are substantially less: (male, 3.7/100,000; female, 1.5/100,000). These rates indicate that hepatitis-B related liver cancer represents the most drastic cancer health disparity affecting Asian Americans. Each of these 3 Asian groups will be the focus of this P01 entitled, ""Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans."" This P01 is comprised of 3 projects: #1 ""Promoting Hepatitis B Screening for Vietnamese Adults""; #2 ""Community-based Hep B Interventions for Hmong Adults""; and #3 ""Increasing Hep B Screening Among Korean Church Attendees."" Synergy among these projects is exemplified by: having all projects focused on the same dependent variable: increasing hepatitis B serological testing rates among adults, ages 18-64; using the Health Behavior Framework; having interventions that compare effects between intervention and control conditions; having research leaders who have worked over 5 years together through the NCI's Asian American Network for Cancer Awareness Research and Training; and 2 supporting cores:  Biostatistics, and Methodology. Our goals are to: (1) Conduct community-based research interventions, focused on reducing hepatitis B-induced liver cancer morbidity and mortality within these 3 Asian American populations; (2) Analyze data and lessons across projects; and (3) Report progress and share findings with the NCI, ethnic leaders, populations-at-risk and professional audiences. If these goals and the specific aims of each of these three projects are achieved, we expect the relevance of this research to public health to include the first empirically derived data on the effectiveness of community based interventions to reduce hepatitis B-induced liver cancer mortality.           ",Liver Cancer Control Interventions for Asian Americans,7914087,P01CA109091,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P01,2010,1458650,0.05685013949673395
"Dissemination Research to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent advances in the practice of cancer prevention, cancer disparities have increased because the beneficial impact for vulnerable communities has been unrealized. A severely limited research base to inform dissemination practice has served as a major contributor to the uneven adoption of evidence-based interventions to promote health and prevent disease. As a result, minority and underserved communities suffer a disproportionate share of the national cancer burden. This application focuses on development of a conceptual model that will serve as the basis of developing a future program in dissemination research, related to reduction of cancer disparities. My research to date illustrates that I have developed a number of effective strategies to address cancer risk in diverse populations. The protected time provided by this award will permit me to focus on development of a conceptual framework that could guide my own and other's work related to dissemination and cancer disparities. This award would provide a critical opportunity for me to do the level of in-depth thinking and collaboration that is necessary to address the vexing problem of dissemination of effective cancer prevention interventions, particularly to populations facing persistent disparities. This award will also allow me to heighten and sustain my personal commitment to mentorship of promising new investigators. The focus of my mentoring to date has been largely with women and racial/ethnic minority group members, and I plan to continue to this focus in my future mentoring activities. The K05 award at this timely moment will heighten research productivity in the critical area of dissemination of cancer prevention and control, help foster the careers of many more dedicated cancer control scientists through my mentorship, and ultimately make an impact on reducing cancer disparities for the 21st century. The solid institutional commitment demonstrated for this protected time provides strong evidence of my ability to meet the proposed research and mentoring objectives.          ",Dissemination Research to Reduce Cancer Disparities,7890511,K05CA124415,"['Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Senior Scientist Award ', ' K05 Award ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Fostering ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Productivity ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' programs ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' member ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Modeling ', ' Communities ', ' dissemination research ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K05,2010,162999,0.040124335077898955
"Identifying Disparities in Type 2 Diabetes Among Asian Americans: The Pan Asian C    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the Asian American population has grown dramatically in size and diversity in recent decades, there are wide gaps in our knowledge of health and healthcare for this population. Asian subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) are often aggregated in clinical and population-based studies because of small numbers in any one subgroup. In particular, data are lacking on Type 2 diabetes and obesity for Asian Americans, suggested to have increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. Moreover, no data explains whether this applies equally for all Asian American subgroups. The prevalence of obesity, pre-diabetes, diabetes and the diabetic complications of diabetes are largely unknown in specific Asian subgroups. There is also a controversy about how obesity should be defined for Asians. In 2004, the World Health Organization recommended lower body mass index (BMI) cut points to define overweight and obesity for people of Asian descent worldwide. However the evidence on which this is based is debatable, and it is possible that this association will be different in Asian subgroups living in the U.S. It is also unknown if risk factors for diabetes are similarly predictive for Asian American subgroups and Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Better information is needed concerning screening, incidence, prevalence, risk factors, natural history of obesity and diabetes, and healthcare and patient factors that affect treatment disparities for Asian American subgroups. This application aims to examine diabetes screening, risk and care both to fill gaps in knowledge of diabetes disparities and to inform clinical decision making regarding screening and healthcare for Asian Americans. We propose to construct a mixed historical and prospective longitudinal cohort by linking existing clinical databases in a large (20,000), multiethnic sample of contemporary Asians in California. We will define Asian subgroups through self-report, and will include a sample of NHWs for comparison. Use of electronic health records in this epidemiologic study will allow highly cost efficient assembly and follow-up of this cohort. The overall goal of this application is to address a substantial gap in existing knowledge regarding diabetes risk in Asian racial/ethnic minorities. This study will provide a greater understanding of diabetes among Asian ethnic minorities in a comparable environment, and would contribute both to a global understanding of risk for Asian populations and to more targeted research, public health and clinical efforts throughout the U.S.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Limited information is available about diabetes among Asians, one of the nation's fastest growing minority groups.

"Participatory Design of a Text Message System to Support Community Health Advisor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer mortality is continuing to decline in the United States; however, African Americans and people with low income and/or education have the highest rates of both new cancers and cancer deaths. The differences in knowledge of cancer risks and possessing misinformation may be a potential contributing factor to cancer health disparities. Due to the unequal burden of cancer among African Americans, the Deep South Network (DSN) for Cancer Control was established in early 2000 to establish sustainable community infrastructure in order to promote cancer awareness and to develop and test innovative, community-based cancer control measures to eliminate cancer mortality disparities among African Americans in Alabama and Mississippi. Community Health Advisors as Research Partners (CHARPs) were trained to deliver cancer awareness activities in their community and to serve as partners in the coordination of community-based research. With the emergence of technology that allows individuals' increased access to information, the development of health promotion programs, e.g. smoking cessation, physical activity, weight management, which use the short messaging service (SMS), or text messaging function of the mobile phone, have shown many positive outcomes. By providing CHARPs with a mobile phone SMS system, CHARPs can have access to accurate and up-to-date cancer health information through synchronous, real-time, communication to community members. The overall goal of the project is to develop and pilot test an innovative, interactive SMS application designed to provide cancer health information and a support network for the DSN CHARPs. The project will be guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This theory suggests that when a user is presented with a new technology, a number of factors (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use) influence her decision about how and when she will use the technology. The specific aims are: to conduct extensive formative research among DSN CHARPs in order to assess the feasibility and acceptability of SMS technology to deliver information and identify cancer information needs; to collaborate with DSN CHARPs to draft and evaluate text messages to be included in the SMS database in order to develop a prototype SMS system aimed at providing cancer information; and to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of the SMS system for delivering cancer information through CHARPs. Results from this study will provide a basis for more extended research in the field of cancer health disparities and mobile phone technology. In addition, a greater understanding of how to distribute cancer health information to those in rural and low resource areas will lead to improved interventions.           Narrative The development of a text messaging system can be used to overcome barriers to obtaining cancer health information across socio-economic groups.

"Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC2) Center to Reduce Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Western New York (WNY) communities suffer from significant disparities in tobacco use and cessation practices, participation in research opportunities and rates of lung, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers. The proposed Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC) Center will address the most striking of these disparities and the burden of cancer in our region by focusing our efforts on minority and urban communities and clinical practices in the cities of Buffalo and Niagara Falls and rural Appalachian communities in neighboring Chautauqua County. We approach the reduction of disparities with clinical and community partnerships from a socio ecological model, with efforts to enhance social capital and reduce perceived racism. The goal of the Center is to ensure that all residents benefit from available clinical and scientific advances to reduce tobacco use, promote healthy lifestyles and behaviors, detect cancer early and participate in clinical and research programs in order to eliminate cancer inequities. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Enhance clinical environments by providing resources, training, outreach and interventions to improve the quality of clinical practice. Aim 2. Enhance outreach to the community by providing technical assistance and tailored outreach interventions to community organizations and partners to increase knowledge of, access to, and use of, beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures. Aim 3. Enhance CBPR training by provide training, mentoring, CBPR and trans-disciplinary research experiences and resources to prepare junior investigators and post-doctoral fellows. Aim 4. Conduct rigorous CBPR research by investigating variables and methods with our community partners to reduce cancer disparities. We propose a full ROI in collaboration with community PCP practices and patients to study the comparative effectiveness of practice enhancements to increase smoking cessation in African American and rural patients; and a pilot study with the Buffalo Latino community to study mechanisms to recruit participants to the cancer center biospecimen banking program. The WNYC^ Center also includes experienced leadership in an Administrative Core, multidimensional Outreach Program, and novel Training Program.          The proposed WNYC(2) Center is innovatively designed to reduce inequities in medically underserved populations in three counties in our region.

"Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Regional CNP located in Alameda County, California the home to one and a half million people and the most diverse county in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has large populations of Asian American (25%), Hispanic Americans (22%), African Americans (17%), and a decreasing Euro-American population (37%), and is the home of the largest group of Afghan refugees in the US. This county not only has diversity in its ethnic/racial composition but also a large population of persons who are uninsured or underinsured and of limited English proficiency. This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement.          At a time of reduced resources, low income populations who are uninsured and of limited English proficiency bear a disproportionate share of the burden of cancer.

"Asian American Liver Cancer Education Program in  Maryland    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for over half of the 1.3 million chronic Hepatitis B cases and deaths from Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the U.S. This excess risk can be attributed to high rates of HBV infection (particularly among first generation immigrants), in combination with low rates of HBV screening and vaccination due to cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers. Because of these combined risk factors, Asian Americans are often diagnosed with late stage cancer, resulting in low survival rates and high mortality rates.       In response to this cancer-related health disparity, this project seeks to develop and implement educational programs to promote HBV screening and increase awareness of liver cancer prevention of Asian Americans in Maryland. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop educational strategies tailored to the needs of target communities to increase public awareness of liver cancer prevention; 2) Implement theory-driven and culturally integrated community-based cancer intervention programs; and 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention on hepatitis B and liver cancer awareness and HBV screening behavior.       Using a randomized control design, a total 900 Asian Americans (300 Vietnamese, Koreans, and Chinese each) age 18 and older will be recruited from 12 community-based organizations (CBO). Each CBO will be randomly assigned to either an intervention (n=6) or control group (n=6). Eligible participants will complete a survey and those in the intervention groups will participate in an educational program. An immediate post survey will be issued to examine the effects of the intervention on intention to obtain HBV screening. Participants will be telephone interviewed 6 months after the intervention to assess actual screening practice. Those in the control group will receive a delayed intervention after the posttest.

AACDR builds upon a program of research on the mental health issues of Asian American populations that had been carried on since 1988 by the National Research Center on Asian American Mental Health (NRCAAMH). AACDR pursues a research agenda that investigates how cultural factors work to either enhance or mitigate the implementation and effectiveness of evidence-based treatments for Asian American clients.  The center's objectives are to (1) conduct programmatic, problem-oriented research toward the empirical testing of effective clinical treatments for Asian American populations; (2) conduct research that has theoretical and policy significance for Asian Americans in particular and the mental health field in general; (3) promote and conduct research that addresses key methodological issues involved in the study of diversity and disparities; (4) be the focal point and stimulus for researchers conducting Asian American disparities research on a national level by maintaining and enhancing a network of researchers, service providers, and policy makers to facilitate theory and methodology development; and (5) bridge science into mental health practice, in particular, concerning cultural influences that affect critical problems of treatment and service delivery such as medical non-adherence and premature dropout. The center's Clinical Effectiveness Research Program tests the effectiveness of evidence-based treatments for depression for Asian American clients and identifies the cultural variables that moderate the effects of these interventions. The Therapist Factors Research Program determines if therapist characteristics associated with cultural competence and the use of evidence-based practices interact or independently affect treatment outcomes for mental health outpatient clients. The Medication Adherence Research Program develops and tests the effectiveness of a culturally targeted intervention designed to improve medication adherence among depressed Asian American clients.    Disparities in health care refer to the differential treatment of patients on the basis of race or ethnicity that is not explained by underlying health conditions or treatment preferences of patients (Institute of Medicine, 2002). Since 1978, various presidential commissions have concluded that the disparities were not so much due to racial and ethnic differences in rates of psychopathology but were due to inaccessible and ineffective treatment. Thus, one critical task is to improve therapeutic effectiveness and quality of care for these clients. Essentially, the center's research mission is devoted to and focused on this latter aspect of disparity-cultural factors that affect the effectiveness of treatment.

"Minnesota Community Networks Center For Eliminating Cancer Disparaties DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this application is to establish a Regional Community Networks Program known as the Minnesota Community Networks Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities among racial/ethnic minority populations in Minnesota with an initial focus on Minnesota's growing new immigrant and refugee populations using Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach. While Minnesota is often perceived to have few minorities, the state's racial/ethnic distribution has changed substantially. Between 1990 and 2008, African Americans in Minnesota grew from 94,944 to 225,648 (138% growth) Latinos grew from 53,884 to 200,736 (273% growth), Asians grew from 77,886 to 180,835 (132% growth), compared to whites who grew from 4,130,395 to 4,559,336 (10% growth). During the same period, the population of foreign-born individuals in Minnesota increased from 260,000 to 340,000. The proposed Center will build on existing statewide cancer prevention and control infrastructure known as Minnesota Cancer Alliance, and on established successful university-community partnerships. In addition to the CNP headquarters at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, the Center will have sites in Willmar (West Central) and Owatonna (Southern), both rural communities in Minnesota.

"Hispanic Community Network to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hispanics are among the fastest growing population in the United States (US).   Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take advantage of cancer prevention activities than their non-Hispanic White counterparts.  Major concerns related to such under use are low socioeconomic status, lack of insurance, cultural values and norms, treatment options, and knowledge and beliefs concerning cancer.  Further, the Hispanic population as a whole has few mentors and researchers of Hispanic ethnicity to provide culturally appropriate role models for Hispanics to enter cancer research fields.  The overall goal of this proposed five year project is to work with community partners to reduce the cancer health disparities experienced by many Hispanics in a rural area.  We propose to build a Network, or infrastructure of community partners in the Yakima Valley.  With the partners we will promote cancer awareness and education in the Valley, establish a system to recruit minority students to work on cancer prevention projects, develop pilot research projects to address specific cancer disparities in the Valley, develop community research projects to increase cancer education among Hispanics, evaluate the success of the research projects, evaluate the intermediate effects of reducing cancer disparities, and sustain the Network by applying for at least one full-scale trial.   Each of the specific aims is targeted to occur in the three required phases of research.  Phase 1, mobilizing the community, will occur in the first year of the project and will continue throughout the remaining years as new partners join the collaboration and new tasks are selected for intervention.  We expect Phase 2, awareness and education activities, training activities, and pilot research projects to continue from years 02 through 05.  The last phase, Phase 3 will occur in Year 05 as we attempt to obtain independent funding to continue the work in the Valley.

"Asian American Liver Cancer Education Program in  Maryland    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for over half of the 1.3 million chronic Hepatitis B cases and deaths from Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the U.S. This excess risk can be attributed to high rates of HBV infection (particularly among first generation immigrants), in combination with low rates of HBV screening and vaccination due to cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers. Because of these combined risk factors, Asian Americans are often diagnosed with late stage cancer, resulting in low survival rates and high mortality rates.       In response to this cancer-related health disparity, this project seeks to develop and implement educational programs to promote HBV screening and increase awareness of liver cancer prevention of Asian Americans in Maryland. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop educational strategies tailored to the needs of target communities to increase public awareness of liver cancer prevention; 2) Implement theory-driven and culturally integrated community-based cancer intervention programs; and 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention on hepatitis B and liver cancer awareness and HBV screening behavior.       Using a randomized control design, a total 900 Asian Americans (300 Vietnamese, Koreans, and Chinese each) age 18 and older will be recruited from 12 community-based organizations (CBO). Each CBO will be randomly assigned to either an intervention (n=6) or control group (n=6). Eligible participants will complete a survey and those in the intervention groups will participate in an educational program. An immediate post survey will be issued to examine the effects of the intervention on intention to obtain HBV screening. Participants will be telephone interviewed 6 months after the intervention to assess actual screening practice. Those in the control group will receive a delayed intervention after the posttest. The insights gained from this proposed liver cancer education program will be valuable in implementing cancer intervention programs for other high risk non-English speaking populations, including economically disadvantaged minorities and will address health disparities in immigrant populations.

"P.L.A.N.E.T. MassCONECT to Promote Evidence-Based Interventions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community partnerships provide a key vehicle for dissemination of evidence-based interventions to promote cancer prevention. Despite fundamental advances in the development of evidence-based interventions, there are significant gaps in translation of this knowledge. In particular, little is known about the barriers faced by community groups in adopting successful evidence-based interventions and how dissemination can be accomplished in community settings. Even less is known about the adoption of these interventions by groups working with the underserved. The goal of our proposed project is to test a community participatory model for dissemination of evidence- based cancer prevention interventions by combining the elements of a national resource, the Cancer Control PLANET, and our close collaborative relationships with community partners developed through MassCONECT, a NCI-funded Community Network Program intervening to reduce cancer disparities in three Massachusetts communities: Boston, Lawrence & Worcester. Using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles as the central guiding framework, we will promote the adoption of our intervention called PLANET MassCONECT, a web portal that adopts the national resource to local conditions. This community participatory model includes several key steps: (1) to seek community input from the Community Project Advisory Committee (C-PAC) and through formative research to assess community- specific factors influencing adoption of the PLANET; and (2) establish a dedicated, customized web portal, PLANET MassCONECT, that presents useable information organized to prevent information overload. To test the model, we will examine if the provision of three types of capital } human capital (community health educators serving as technical resources and workshops to train community members), social capital (communications among potential users leading to social capital), and financial capital (modest infrastructure support and pilot intervention grants) } will increase the organizational capacity to plan, adopt and implement evidence-based cancer control interventions in communities of three different sizes and structures. The outcomes of interest are collective efficacy, use of PLANET MassCONECT, PLANET reach, program planning and program adoption. We plan to disseminate the intervention, if successful, using two national cancer prevention networks funded by NCI and CDC, NCI's Cancer Information Service and the American Cancer Society. This study builds from a solid foundation of collaboration among community, academic and national partners to advance our understanding of dissemination of evidence-based interventions through community-based participatory approach.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of PLANET MassCONECT is to design and test a model of dissemination of evidenced-based cancer-control interventions for adoption by community groups who serve the underserved in three Massachusetts communities - Boston, Lawrence, and Worcester. From research on health interventions, we know much about what should be done to promote health and prevent diseases, yet know little about how to translate those interventions into real world settings. The PLANET MassCONECT study will follow a community participatory model, allowing us to address the many barriers to successful dissemination, and is focused on building community capacity to ensure sustainability.

"Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC)    DESCRIPTION: In response to RFA CA-09-032, the Center for Asian Health of Temple University proposes to establish a regional Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) to address the cancer burden and co-morbidities among underserved Asian American populations through community outreach, research, and training. The proposed Center builds upon the successful collaborations that were fostered during the previous ATECAR SPN and ATECAR CNP-I cycles and consists of academic institutions, community organizations, and community healthcare providers. The ACCHDC will work towards the overall goal of reducing cancer health disparities by increasing knowledge of, access to and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures in underserved Asian American communities. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to guide all Center activities, which fall within four components: the Administrative Core (AC), Community Outreach Program (COP), Research Program (RP) and Training Program (TP). The AC will provide essential administrative, scientific, programmatic, and community leadership and timely coordination of Center operations. The COP will focus on building cancer control capacity and increasing knowledge and access to cancer prevention among the multi-ethnic and multilingual Asian communities in the eastern region of the US (PA, NJ and NYC). Under the RP, a large-scale controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBPR colorectal cancer (CRC) intervention in increasing screening, knowledge of, perceived risks of and susceptibility to CRC and benefits of screening, as well as reducing health system barriers to screening. The pilot study, led by a junior investigator, will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate education intervention in increasing knowledge of and intent to participate in Hepatitis B biospecimen research and examining cultural factors associated with the participation in biospecimen research. The TP will develop and implement a comprehensive research training program in CBPR methods and provide mentorship and key resources to junior researchers from racial/ethnic minority and underrepresented groups.

"Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP)     University of Washington (UW) and Black Hills Center for American Indian Health (BHCAIH) seek support for Native People for Cancer Control (NPCC), a currentiy-funded regional Community Networks Program (CNP). NPCC is organized into an Administrafive Core and Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs. Directorship of NPCC will be shared by Dedra Buchwald, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director, Partnerships for Native Health, UW; and Jeffrey Henderson (Cheyenne River Sioux), MD, MPH, President and CEO of the community-based, non-profit BHCAIH in Rapid City, SD. NPCC serves an 8-state region and is headquartered at UW in Seattle, with 3 additional sites that align geographically with the conduct of our Community Outreach Program activities. Site 1 includes Washington, Alaska, and Oregon; Site 2 includes Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming; and Site 3 includes North and South Dakota. NPCC will include 15 American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) investigators, staff, and partners. AI/ANs have the poorest 5-year sun/ival from all cancers combined among all U.S. racial/ethnic groups,(12) and access to cancer clinical trials is difficult. Our overarching aim, therefore, is to direcfiy contribute to improved cancer health outcomes and quality of life for AI/AN populations, which experience dramafic health inequities. Our central strategy is to capitalize on opportunlties and leverage existing resources to pursue an integrated, mulfifaceted research program that is catalyzed by tight partnerships with Native communities. We will address cancer health issues ranging from prevenfion and clinical trials to survivorship. Our long-term goal is to generate findings that can be translated into practices and policies that will reduce AI/AN cancer-related health disparities. Thus, our Specific Aims are to: 1) increase cancer educafion, outreach, health promotion, and prevention efforts among urban and mral AI/ANs through the activities of the Community Outreach Program; 2) conduct 1 Research Project, 2 CNP Pilot Projects, and 2 Training Projects using community-based participatory methods that focus on colorectal cancer screening, health literacy and communication, cancer risk factors and care, and clinical trials educafion among Al/ANs; 3) train at least 5 AI/AN junior faculty members to conduct research through the efforts of the Training Program; and 4) reduce cancer health disparities by increasing access to, and use of, inten/entions among AI/AN populations through all NPCC activifies. These activities will be coordinated by the Administrafive Core. With a wide network of partners, 25 funded cancer-related grants and 54 publications by NPCC-affiliated investigators, NPPC has the essential elements of a successful CNP, both as an individual site and as a member ofthe CNP network.        Healthy People 2010 focuses on health disparities, yet progress reports revealed minimal improvement for Al/ANs in areas previously identified as problematic. For example, only 62% of AI/ANs had health insurance, virtually unchanged over the previous 4 years, and life expectancy for AI/ANs was up to 8 years shorter than for non-Al/ANs. Cancer morbidity, mortality, risk prevalence, and barriers to care remain major problems in Native communities. Concerted, coordinated, multidisciplinary efforts are needed to redress the striking cancer-related disparities experienced by this vulnerable population.",Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP),8008555,U54CA153498,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U54,2010,767285,0.02178703211876607

"ASIAN AMERICAN NETWORK FOR CANCER AWARENESS RESEARCH & TRAINING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The overall mission of the Asian American Network for Cancer Awareness, Research and Training (AANCART) is to reduce cancer health disparities by conducting community-based participatory education, training, and research by, for, and with Asian Americans in Sacramento, CA (also serves as Headquarters); San Francisco, CA; Los Angeles, CA; Seattle, WA; Hawaii (state); and Houston, TX.  This Network is a national one, comprised of seven NCI cancer centers and their associated universities, the California Department of Health Services, Chinese Community Health Care Association, and the Hmong Women's Heritage Association.  Cumulatively, this Network serves nearly 50 percent of all Asian Americans.  Consistent with RFA-CA-05-012, AANCART's deliverables are:  (1) Sustenance of a highly interactive Network among AANCART regions to catalyze cancer education for Asian Americans; (2) Establishment of research training programs that address Asian American cancer health disparities; and (3) Process and impact data to document the extent to which specific cancer health disparities are reduced among Cambodians, Chinese, Filipino, Hmong, Korean, and Vietnamese.  Examples of Asian American disparities to be addressed include those associated with smoking-related lung and hepatitis B-induced liver cancers, low breast and cervical cancer screening rates, and emerging cancer threats posed by acculturation, diet, and insufficient ethnically-specific representation in clinical trials. Aims will be achieved through both Network-wide and regional activities by the AANCART Steering Committee and involving Asian American-oriented community-based organizations, Cancer Information Service staff, and other supportive entities tied together through past histories of collaboration and memoranda of understanding and letters of support.  Universities associated with AANCART, the California Department of Health and the Chinese Community Health Plan are committed to additional support for AANCART.

"Community Networks Program: The Johns Hopkins Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under the direction of its community partners within Baltimore City and Prince George's County, the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center proposes to formally establish the ""Community Networks Program (CNP): The Johns Hopkins Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities."" The proposed Center arises from an established community-academic practice partnership that has been active across the two counties, in delivery of cancer screening services, and in research. These predominantly African American counties differ in socio economic status, but both experience disproportionate mortality due to breast, cervix and colorectal cancer. The objective of this proposal is to create an infrastructure to support community-driven research that creates training opportunities for early-stage investigators. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To establish an Administrative Core to provide leadership for the Center's overall strategic planning, including scientific leader-ship-and-oversight-on using-the-GBPR approach and its core-principles; 2) To develop a Community- Outreach Program that leverages existing community outreach initiatives targeted to multiethnic underserved populations in Baltimore City and Prince George's County; 3) To implement a Research Program consisting of two projects: a) the Full Research Project, ""Evaluating Coaches of Older Adults for Cancer Care and Healthy Behaviors (COACH)"", a randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of trained, participant designated coaches vs. professionally-based navigators, in supporting adherence to cancer screening; and b) the Pilot Educational Research Project, a mixed-methods study that examines knowledge, attitudes and willingness of multiethnic older adults to participate in a cancer-related biospecimen repository; 4) To establish a Training Program with the primary goal of increasing the number of qualified health disparity researchers experienced in using CBPR in the context of cancer disparities. The CNP Center at Johns Hopkins will create a sustainable infrastructure for community based participatory research on a large, multiple project, highly collaborative scale, It will increase knowledge of, access to, and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures related to cancer in areas ranging from prevention to early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.              ",Community Networks Program: The Johns Hopkins Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities,8137964,U54CA153710,[''],NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U54,2011,895972,0.03732786189923304
"Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN)    DESCRIPTION: Moffitt Cancer Center and an established network of community partners propose the formation of a regional Center for addressing the cancer burden in a tri-county area. This Center builds on the significant successes of an existing community-academic network program called the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network, draws on enriching programmatic partnerships, and builds on our considerable experience in developing innovative education, training and research programs that recognize the importance of culture and literacy in cancer care. The Center strengthens our community-based infrastructure that is currently characterized by relevant, sincere and trustworthy partnerships that serve medically underserved individuals and families, and which cuts across all racial/ethnic groups including a growing number of foreign-born populations. Grounded in methodological approaches that use community-based participatory research (CBPR), Center aims are to: increase knowledge of, access, and use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures through health promotion and outreach activities; conduct innovative evidence-based research following CBPR principles and to train qualified health disparity researchers in using CBPR approaches. The Center is   comprised of an Administrative Core that provides oversight and three highly complementary Programs   (Outreach, Research and Training) that work synergistically with members of the Steering Committee and Community Advisory Group. The Outreach Program, anchored by activities that engage communities around cancer prevention and control activities, centers on dissemination of credible resources, and makes linkages to the NCI National Outreach Network. The Research Program addresses several determinants (access, knowledge and health literacy) that impact health disparities, and offers solutions by conduct of an investigator initiated intervention research study for increasing uptake of colorectal cancer screening, and a pilot educational research project that extends the CNP Center's interests in biobanking. The Training Program draws on the tenets of mentoring, collaboration and networking, and innovatively puts into place didactic and immersion training opportunities involving academic and community mentors.             The goal of the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network is to find ways to reduce the cancer burden among medically underserved populations in our community.

"Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC)    DESCRIPTION: In response to RFA CA-09-032, the Center for Asian Health of Temple University proposes to establish a regional Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) to address the cancer burden and co-morbidities among underserved Asian American populations through community outreach, research, and training. The proposed Center builds upon the successful collaborations that were fostered during the previous ATECAR SPN and ATECAR CNP-I cycles and consists of academic institutions, community organizations, and community healthcare providers. The ACCHDC will work towards the overall goal of reducing cancer health disparities by increasing knowledge of, access to and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures in underserved Asian American communities. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to guide all Center activities, which fall within four components: the Administrative Core (AC), Community Outreach Program (COP), Research Program (RP) and Training Program (TP). The AC will provide essential administrative, scientific, programmatic, and community leadership and timely coordination of Center operations. The COP will focus on building cancer control capacity and increasing knowledge and access to cancer prevention among the multi-ethnic and multilingual Asian communities in the eastern region of the US (PA, NJ and NYC). Under the RP, a large-scale controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBPR colorectal cancer (CRC) intervention in increasing screening, knowledge of, perceived risks of and susceptibility to CRC and benefits of screening, as well as reducing health system barriers to screening. The pilot study, led by a junior investigator, will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate education intervention in increasing knowledge of and intent to participate in Hepatitis B biospecimen research and examining cultural factors associated with the participation in biospecimen research. The TP will develop and implement a comprehensive research training program in CBPR methods and provide mentorship and key resources to junior researchers from racial/ethnic minority and underrepresented groups. Center team members have forged successful collaborations during ATECAR SPN and CNP-I, have established strong partnerships with Asian communities and are dedicated to the Center's mission of reducing cancer health disparities in underserved Asian Americans.             The proposed ACCHDC program will make a significant contributions toward enhancing our understanding of, and increasing our capacity to reduce, cancer health disparities among Asian Americans.

"Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN)    DESCRIPTION: Moffitt Cancer Center and an established network of community partners propose the formation of a regional Center for addressing the cancer burden in a tri-county area. This Center builds on the significant successes of an existing community-academic network program called the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network, draws on enriching programmatic partnerships, and builds on our considerable experience in developing innovative education, training and research programs that recognize the importance of culture and literacy in cancer care. The Center strengthens our community-based infrastructure that is currently characterized by relevant, sincere and trustworthy partnerships that serve medically underserved individuals and families, and which cuts across all racial/ethnic groups including a growing number of foreign-born populations. Grounded in methodological approaches that use community-based participatory research (CBPR), Center aims are to: increase knowledge of, access, and use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures through health promotion and outreach activities; conduct innovative evidence-based research following CBPR principles and to train qualified health disparity researchers in using CBPR approaches. The Center is   comprised of an Administrative Core that provides oversight and three highly complementary Programs   (Outreach, Research and Training) that work synergistically with members of the Steering Committee and Community Advisory Group. The Outreach Program, anchored by activities that engage communities around cancer prevention and control activities, centers on dissemination of credible resources, and makes linkages to the NCI National Outreach Network. The Research Program addresses several determinants (access, knowledge and health literacy) that impact health disparities, and offers solutions by conduct of an investigator initiated intervention research study for increasing uptake of colorectal cancer screening, and a pilot educational research project that extends the CNP Center's interests in biobanking. The Training Program draws on the tenets of mentoring, collaboration and networking, and innovatively puts into place didactic and immersion training opportunities involving academic and community mentors.             The goal of the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network is to find ways to reduce the cancer burden among medically underserved populations in our community. This will be achieved by building on an established network of community partners working collaboratively with an academic partner, the Moffitt Cancer Center, through innovative outreach, research and training activities involving community members..",Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN),8319831,U54CA153509,"['Outreach Research ', ' Community Surveys ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' health literacy ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer care ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Training Activity ', ' Peer Review ', ' Research Activity ', ' Knowledge ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Outcome ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Training Programs ', ' Cancer Center ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' skills ', ' experience ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Address ', ' Training ', ' improved ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Procedures ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Family ', ' Faculty ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Research ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Health ', ' Communities ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Solutions ', ' Funding ', ' Area ', ' Generations ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Mentors ', ' evidence base ', ' career ', ' literacy ', ' Awareness ', ' outreach ', ' interest ', ' Behavioral ', ' base ', ' Ethnic group ', ' County ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Output ', ' Community Networks ', ' Community Health ', ' satisfaction ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Training and Education ', ' uptake ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Qualifying ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Goals ', ' Individual ', ' Grant ', ' success ', ' member ', ' tool ', ' Work ', ' Population ', ' programs ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved ', ' Immersion Investigative Technique ', ' Immersion ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"NU:  NEIGHBORS:  A Social Science Partnership to Reduce Cancer Disparities ( 1 of DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (RHLCCC-NU) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) - the only Midwestern four-year Hispanic Serving Institution are partnering to establish the NU-Northeastern Illinois Guild for Health Behavior Oncology Research & Science.  This NU NEIGHBORS application represents a strategic collaboration with the ultimate goal of reducing and eliminating cancer disparities which are prominent in Chicago. We aim to foster community-engaged, social science cancer disparities research, build a platform for public health-related curriculum modification, and create a pipeline of well-trained and experienced cancer researchers and students who choose health and science-related careers. NEIU has evolved into a comprehensive university with a track record of training highly qualified bachelor's and master's-level students for professional careers in the social sciences, education, and science fields. Complementary to NEIU strengths, RHLCCC-NU conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research with an excess of $158 million in annual extramural funding and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  This synergy will facilitate accomplishment of the following objectives: 1) to expose NEIU faculty and students to research conducted at RHLCCC-NU in the areas of medical social sciences, community engagement and health disparities; 2) to enhance RHLCCC-NU and NEIUs collaborative research efforts and networking opportunities through increased participation in conferences and symposia; 3) to introduce cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research principles through workshops, seminars, lectures, community/university outreach, and academic instruction; 4) to incorporate team-based research projects that will generate a steady pipeline of students to continue advanced studies; 5) to incorporate innovative experience-learning curricular modifications to expose students to cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research; and 6) to develop scientists who will succeed in securing funding that addresses cancer disparities. We propose a three-pronged approach to achieve these objectives.  First, in the initial planning phase, we will establish our administrative leadership and a community steering committee (CSC) focused on integrating scientific research training, education modification, and community engagement throughout the 4 years of this effort. Second, administrative leadership and the CSC will work to set priorities. Finally, during the implementation stage, we will conduct a series of NEIU-NU pilot research and education projects meant to develop into competitive and collaborative research and training grants and a larger U54 MSI-CCC Partnership Grant. Collectively, these efforts will engage the diverse faculty and student populations at NEIU and NU into a cohesive network of cancer-related social sciences research and education aimed at reducing cancer health disparities. RELEVANCE: The presence of major cancer health disparities in Chicago is well-documented, and this proposed partnership poses a unique approach to reduce deeply-engrained disparities. NU NEIGHBORS is a partnership in research and education; we aim to foster and enhance efforts to build a pipeline of students entering health-related careers, increase the number of cancer health disparities researchers and facilitate translation of cancer research to Chicago land communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",NU:  NEIGHBORS:  A Social Science Partnership to Reduce Cancer Disparities ( 1 of,8259267,P20CA165588,"['Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Graduate Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Illinois ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mentorship ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Students ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' skills training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' science education ', ' success ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' outreach ', ' technological innovation ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' R25 Program ', ' R25 Mechanism ', ' Education Projects ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Qualifying ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' social science research ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,P20,2011,125350,0.014875794614402355

"HORIZON Center: Healthy Options, Research, Interventions & Community Organizing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass Boston) and Harvard University School of Public Health (HSPH) have partnered with the Cherishing Our Hearts and Souls Coalition (COHS) of Roxbury (a Boston neighborhood comprised of 51% African Americans and 23% Hispanics) to establish an exploratory Center (P20) for Health and Health Care Disparities that is dedicated to Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR). The Healthy Options, Research, Interventions & Community Organizing Center (HORIZON Center) will: 1) conduct health disparities related research projects in partnership with COHS, 2) offer research training, with an emphasis in CBPR, to faculty, students, and community stakeholders, and 3) build a neighborhood based infrastructure that can partner with academic institutions in Boston to research and implement ""best practices"" in CBPR and academic-community partnerships. UMass Boston was designated a minority-serving institution by the National Cancer Institute and is the lead partner in the HORIZON Center. The diverse characteristics and strengths reflected in both academic institutions and in the six-year old community coalition (COHS) set the stage for significant changes in cultural norms (public knowledge, attitudes and behaviors) and professional practices surrounding research activities and academic community partnerships. The implications of successfully engaging a diverse urban underserved community in health promotion activities, in research and in advancing the cause of research are nationally significant. We partner to further the research mission of COHS and its Community Research Advisory Board (CRAB). The HORIZON Center has 4 cores, 3 research projects and 6 pilot projects; all designed to strengthen the evidence-based practices and strategies for understanding and training practitioners in health disparities reduction. We propose to increase the number of local agencies, community organizations and residents that contribute to and participate in research, training, health promotion, and community organizing activities. The cores provide an infrastructure and process for the translation of research into innovative community outreach strategies, educational interventions and public policy initiatives. The Administrative Core provides overall support to the HORIZON Center by coordinating the other cores and projects. The Research Core supports the research projects which are investigating the behavioral, social, and biological sciences related to health disparities. The Community Engagement Core is responsible for projects that investigate the best practices for outreach and mobilization in an urban community. The Training Core is responsible for projects that implement and evaluate strategies for increasing the number of people who are trained and engaged in CBPR and from health disparity populations.          ","HORIZON Center: Healthy Options, Research, Interventions & Community Organizing",8077401,P20MD002290,[''],NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,P20,2011,1941773,-0.0009220843537467445
"Asian American Liver Cancer Education Program in  Maryland    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for over half of the 1.3 million chronic Hepatitis B cases and deaths from Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the U.S. This excess risk can be attributed to high rates of HBV infection (particularly among first generation immigrants), in combination with low rates of HBV screening and vaccination due to cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers. Because of these combined risk factors, Asian Americans are often diagnosed with late stage cancer, resulting in low survival rates and high mortality rates.       In response to this cancer-related health disparity, this project seeks to develop and implement educational programs to promote HBV screening and increase awareness of liver cancer prevention of Asian Americans in Maryland. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop educational strategies tailored to the needs of target communities to increase public awareness of liver cancer prevention; 2) Implement theory-driven and culturally integrated community-based cancer intervention programs; and 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention on hepatitis B and liver cancer awareness and HBV screening behavior.       Using a randomized control design, a total 900 Asian Americans (300 Vietnamese, Koreans, and Chinese each) age 18 and older will be recruited from 12 community-based organizations (CBO). Each CBO will be randomly assigned to either an intervention (n=6) or control group (n=6). Eligible participants will complete a survey and those in the intervention groups will participate in an educational program. An immediate post survey will be issued to examine the effects of the intervention on intention to obtain HBV screening. Participants will be telephone interviewed 6 months after the intervention to assess actual screening practice. Those in the control group will receive a delayed intervention after the posttest. The insights gained from this proposed liver cancer education program will be valuable in implementing cancer intervention programs for other high risk non-English speaking populations, including economically disadvantaged minorities and will address health disparities in immigrant populations.             ",Asian American Liver Cancer Education Program in  Maryland,8111862,R25CA129042,"['Cancer Intervention ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Chronic Hepatitis B ', ' chronic hepatitis B virus infection ', ' chronic HBV infection ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Chinese American ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' intervention effect ', ' Caucasians ', ' Awareness ', ' Prevention program ', ' intervention program ', ' North America ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Research Training ', ' Intention ', ' outreach ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Immigrant ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' liver cancer prevention ', ' group intervention ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Survival Rate ', ' improved ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Control Groups ', ' Time ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Country ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' high risk ', ' Goals ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Generations ', ' Solid ', ' programs ', ' Population ', ' American ', ' Age ', ' Research ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' base ', ' Address ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Work ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Effectiveness ', ' insight ', ' Accounting ', ' response ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Behavior ', ' Risk ', ' Individual ', ' theories ', ' Participant ', ' Collaborations ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Minority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Universities ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Vaccination ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Maryland ', ' community organizations ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' eligible participant ', ' cancer education ', ' Koreans ', ' Improve Access ', ' Korean American ', ' Hepatitis B Vaccination ', ' Hepatitis B series immunization ', ' Hepatitis B injection ', ' Hepatitis B immunization ', ' Hep B vaccination ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R25,2011,274632,0.056331091226951076
"Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the United States. Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take part in cancer prevention and screening activities than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. The overall goal of this project is to work collaboratively with regional partners to reduce cancer disparities. It is the long-term goal of this proposed Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to reduce the cancer disparities experienced by Hispanics in the two regions selected for this project. Our short-term objectives are to:   1. Develop and enhance our existing relationships with community partners in Regions 1 and 2 to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos and members of the Yakama Nation (Administrative Core)   2. Increase health promotion outreach and cancer screening activities among Latinos and members of   the Yakama Nation (Outreach Core); 3. Increase cervical cancer screening among Latinas using a rigorous research project (Research Core); 4. Develop and assess the feasibility of a sustainable support system for cancer patients and survivors (research Core); and 5. Train junior investigators, especially underrepresented minorities, in grant writing and CBPR to reduce cancer disparities.    This proposed Community Networks Program (CNP) builds on our existing CNP (2005 - 2010). It proposes to add a randomized clinical trial to assess two different approaches to motivate cervical cancer screening. Further it adds a patient navigator approach to reduce time to follow-up of an abnormal pap test. The pilot project builds on existing community concerns. Through its outreach core, the proposed Center will spread information and support at the population level. The training core will help train a new generation of scientists in CBPR and scientific research. Through its four cores, the proposed Center will cover a myriad of cancer disparities and assist NCI in its endeavor to reduce such disparities.             Latinos are at high risk for specific types of cancer and have a higher mortality rate for other types of cancer.  In this project, we will increase cancer education and outreach to Latinos as well as conduct research to reduce their cancer disparities.

"Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Regional CNP located in Alameda County, California the home to one and a half million people and the most diverse county in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has large populations of Asian American (25%), Hispanic Americans (22%), African Americans (17%), and a decreasing Euro-American population (37%), and is the home of the largest group of Afghan refugees in the US. This county not only has diversity in its ethnic/racial composition but also a large population of persons who are uninsured or underinsured and of limited English proficiency. This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement.          At a time of reduced resources, low income populations who are uninsured and of limited English proficiency bear a disproportionate share of the burden of cancer.

"Dissemination Research to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent advances in the practice of cancer prevention, cancer disparities have increased because the beneficial impact for vulnerable communities has been unrealized. A severely limited research base to inform dissemination practice has served as a major contributor to the uneven adoption of evidence-based interventions to promote health and prevent disease. As a result, minority and underserved communities suffer a disproportionate share of the national cancer burden. This application focuses on development of a conceptual model that will serve as the basis of developing a future program in dissemination research, related to reduction of cancer disparities. My research to date illustrates that I have developed a number of effective strategies to address cancer risk in diverse populations. The protected time provided by this award will permit me to focus on development of a conceptual framework that could guide my own and other's work related to dissemination and cancer disparities. This award would provide a critical opportunity for me to do the level of in-depth thinking and collaboration that is necessary to address the vexing problem of dissemination of effective cancer prevention interventions, particularly to populations facing persistent disparities. This award will also allow me to heighten and sustain my personal commitment to mentorship of promising new investigators. The focus of my mentoring to date has been largely with women and racial/ethnic minority group members, and I plan to continue to this focus in my future mentoring activities. The K05 award at this timely moment will heighten research productivity in the critical area of dissemination of cancer prevention and control, help foster the careers of many more dedicated cancer control scientists through my mentorship, and ultimately make an impact on reducing cancer disparities for the 21st century.

"Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Regional CNP located in Alameda County, California the home to one and a half million people and the most diverse county in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has large populations of Asian American (25%), Hispanic Americans (22%), African Americans (17%), and a decreasing Euro-American population (37%), and is the home of the largest group of Afghan refugees in the US. This county not only has diversity in its ethnic/racial composition but also a large population of persons who are uninsured or underinsured and of limited English proficiency. This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement.          At a time of reduced resources, low income populations who are uninsured and of limited English proficiency bear a disproportionate share of the burden of cancer.

"Asian American Center on Disparities Research This application establishes the Asian American Center on Disparities Research (AACDR). AACDR builds upon a program of research on the mental health issues of Asian American populations that had been carried on since 1988 by the National Research Center on Asian American Mental Health (NRCAAMH). AACDR pursues a research agenda that investigates how cultural factors work to either enhance or mitigate the implementation and effectiveness of evidence-based treatments for Asian American clients.  The center's objectives are to (1) conduct programmatic, problem-oriented research toward the empirical testing of effective clinical treatments for Asian American populations; (2) conduct research that has theoretical and policy significance for Asian Americans in particular and the mental health field in general; (3) promote and conduct research that addresses key methodological issues involved in the study of diversity and disparities; (4) be the focal point and stimulus for researchers conducting Asian American disparities research on a national level by maintaining and enhancing a network of researchers, service providers, and policy makers to facilitate theory and methodology development; and (5) bridge science into mental health practice, in particular, concerning cultural influences that affect critical problems of treatment and service delivery such as medical non-adherence and premature dropout. The center's Clinical Effectiveness Research Program tests the effectiveness of evidence-based treatments for depression for Asian American clients and identifies the cultural variables that moderate the effects of these interventions. The Therapist Factors Research Program determines if therapist characteristics associated with cultural competence and the use of evidence-based practices interact or independently affect treatment outcomes for mental health outpatient clients. The Medication Adherence Research Program develops and tests the effectiveness of a culturally targeted intervention designed to improve medication adherence among depressed Asian American clients.    Disparities in health care refer to the differential treatment of patients on the basis of race or ethnicity that is not explained by underlying health conditions or treatment preferences of patients (Institute of Medicine, 2002). Since 1978, various presidential commissions have concluded that the disparities were not so much due to racial and ethnic differences in rates of psychopathology but were due to inaccessible and ineffective treatment. Thus, one critical task is to improve therapeutic effectiveness and quality of care for these clients. Essentially, the center's research mission is devoted to and focused on this latter aspect of disparity-cultural factors that affect the effectiveness of treatment.

"NU:  NEIGHBORS:  A Social Science Partnership to Reduce Cancer Disparities (2 of* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (RHLCCC-NU) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) - the only Midwestern four-year Hispanic Serving Institution are partnering to establish the NU-Northeastern Illinois Guild for Health Behavior Oncology Research & Science.  This NU NEIGHBORS application represents a strategic collaboration with the ultimate goal of reducing and eliminating cancer disparities which are prominent in Chicago. We aim to foster community-engaged, social science cancer disparities research, build a platform for public health-related curriculum modification, and create a pipeline of well-trained and experienced cancer researchers and students who choose health and science-related careers. NEIU has evolved into a comprehensive university with a track record of training highly qualified bachelor's and master's-level students for professional careers in the social sciences, education, and science fields. Complementary to NEIU strengths, RHLCCC-NU conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research with an excess of $158 million in annual extramural funding and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  This synergy will facilitate accomplishment of the following objectives: 1) to expose NEIU faculty and students to research conducted at RHLCCC-NU in the areas of medical social sciences, community engagement and health disparities; 2) to enhance RHLCCC-NU and NEIUs collaborative research efforts and networking opportunities through increased participation in conferences and symposia; 3) to introduce cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research principles through workshops, seminars, lectures, community/university outreach, and academic instruction; 4) to incorporate team-based research projects that will generate a steady pipeline of students to continue advanced studies; 5) to incorporate innovative experience-learning curricular modifications to expose students to cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research; and 6) to develop scientists who will succeed in securing funding that addresses cancer disparities. We propose a three-pronged approach to achieve these objectives.  First, in the initial planning phase, we will establish our administrative leadership and a community steering committee (CSC) focused on integrating scientific research training, education modification, and community engagement throughout the 4 years of this effort. Second, administrative leadership and the CSC will work to set priorities. Finally, during the implementation stage, we will conduct a series of NEIU-NU pilot research and education projects meant to develop into competitive and collaborative research and training grants and a larger U54 MSI-CCC Partnership Grant. Collectively, these efforts will engage the diverse faculty and student populations at NEIU and NU into a cohesive network of cancer-related social sciences research and education aimed at reducing cancer health disparities. RELEVANCE: The presence of major cancer health disparities in Chicago is well-documented, and this proposed partnership poses a unique approach to reduce deeply-engrained disparities.

"Southeast Michigan Community Network Program    DESCRIPTION: This application, in response to RFA-CA-09-032, Community Networks Program (U54), proposes to continue our vibrant, comprehensive, and sustainable program to reduce disparities in breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in southeast Michigan. Under CNP I, we have mobilized with extraordinary community partners to implement an integrated system of community-based participatory education, training, and research activities. Our regional CNP II Center will include four large urban areas severely impacted by economic hardship: Detroit, Inkster, Southfield, and Pontiac. This tri-county area accounts for 71.3% of Michigan's African American population and 42% of the state's below poverty population. In SE Michigan, older African Americans have higher rates of poverty and comorbid medical diseases related to being underserved medically (5, 6). Our team of collaborating investigators and community partners will continue to build on our established partnerships. The effort will be led by the Karmanos Cancer Institute, the School of Medicine at Wayne State University, and the Josephine Ford Cancer Center of the Henry Ford Health System. Support for our CNP I and now CNP II is broadly based, demonstrated by the community leaders, researchers, clinicians and public officials with whom we have strong relationships and who have joined our Center Steering Committee and Community Advisory Group, and have written letters of support included in this application. We propose a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach to address three aims for reducing disparities: Aim 1. To continue to increase knowledge, access and use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures to reduce disparities related to breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer, among older, underserved African American adults in southeast Michigan; Aim 2. To continue to develop and implement evidence-based intervention research to increase use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures for cancer prevention, detection and treatment of older African Americans; and Aim 3. To recruit and train a critical mass of promising and successful new researchers in CBPR to reduce cancer health disparities.          RELEVANCE (See Instructions):  Older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of cancers, are first diagnosed at advanced stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates.

"Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP)     University of Washington (UW) and Black Hills Center for American Indian Health (BHCAIH) seek support for Native People for Cancer Control (NPCC), a currentiy-funded regional Community Networks Program (CNP). NPCC is organized into an Administrafive Core and Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs. Directorship of NPCC will be shared by Dedra Buchwald, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director, Partnerships for Native Health, UW; and Jeffrey Henderson (Cheyenne River Sioux), MD, MPH, President and CEO of the community-based, non-profit BHCAIH in Rapid City, SD. NPCC serves an 8-state region and is headquartered at UW in Seattle, with 3 additional sites that align geographically with the conduct of our Community Outreach Program activities. Site 1 includes Washington, Alaska, and Oregon; Site 2 includes Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming; and Site 3 includes North and South Dakota. NPCC will include 15 American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) investigators, staff, and partners. AI/ANs have the poorest 5-year sun/ival from all cancers combined among all U.S. racial/ethnic groups,(12) and access to cancer clinical trials is difficult. Our overarching aim, therefore, is to direcfiy contribute to improved cancer health outcomes and quality of life for AI/AN populations, which experience dramafic health inequities. Our central strategy is to capitalize on opportunlties and leverage existing resources to pursue an integrated, mulfifaceted research program that is catalyzed by tight partnerships with Native communities. We will address cancer health issues ranging from prevenfion and clinical trials to survivorship. Our long-term goal is to generate findings that can be translated into practices and policies that will reduce AI/AN cancer-related health disparities. Thus, our Specific Aims are to: 1) increase cancer educafion, outreach, health promotion, and prevention efforts among urban and mral AI/ANs through the activities of the Community Outreach Program; 2) conduct 1 Research Project, 2 CNP Pilot Projects, and 2 Training Projects using community-based participatory methods that focus on colorectal cancer screening, health literacy and communication, cancer risk factors and care, and clinical trials educafion among Al/ANs; 3) train at least 5 AI/AN junior faculty members to conduct research through the efforts of the Training Program; and 4) reduce cancer health disparities by increasing access to, and use of, inten/entions among AI/AN populations through all NPCC activifies. These activities will be coordinated by the Administrafive Core. With a wide network of partners, 25 funded cancer-related grants and 54 publications by NPCC-affiliated investigators, NPPC has the essential elements of a successful CNP, both as an individual site and as a member ofthe CNP network.        Healthy People 2010 focuses on health disparities, yet progress reports revealed minimal improvement for Al/ANs in areas previously identified as problematic. For example, only 62% of AI/ANs had health insurance, virtually unchanged over the previous 4 years, and life expectancy for AI/ANs was up to 8 years shorter than for non-Al/ANs. Cancer morbidity, mortality, risk prevalence, and barriers to care remain major problems in Native communities.

"Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN)    DESCRIPTION: Moffitt Cancer Center and an established network of community partners propose the formation of a regional Center for addressing the cancer burden in a tri-county area. This Center builds on the significant successes of an existing community-academic network program called the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network, draws on enriching programmatic partnerships, and builds on our considerable experience in developing innovative education, training and research programs that recognize the importance of culture and literacy in cancer care. The Center strengthens our community-based infrastructure that is currently characterized by relevant, sincere and trustworthy partnerships that serve medically underserved individuals and families, and which cuts across all racial/ethnic groups including a growing number of foreign-born populations. Grounded in methodological approaches that use community-based participatory research (CBPR), Center aims are to: increase knowledge of, access, and use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures through health promotion and outreach activities; conduct innovative evidence-based research following CBPR principles and to train qualified health disparity researchers in using CBPR approaches. The Center is   comprised of an Administrative Core that provides oversight and three highly complementary Programs   (Outreach, Research and Training) that work synergistically with members of the Steering Committee and Community Advisory Group. The Outreach Program, anchored by activities that engage communities around cancer prevention and control activities, centers on dissemination of credible resources, and makes linkages to the NCI National Outreach Network. The Research Program addresses several determinants (access, knowledge and health literacy) that impact health disparities, and offers solutions by conduct of an investigator initiated intervention research study for increasing uptake of colorectal cancer screening, and a pilot educational research project that extends the CNP Center's interests in biobanking. The Training Program draws on the tenets of mentoring, collaboration and networking, and innovatively puts into place didactic and immersion training opportunities involving academic and community mentors.             The goal of the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network is to find ways to reduce the cancer burden among medically underserved populations in our community.

"Arkansas Cancer Community Network (ARCCN)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite cancer incidence rates that align with national averages, Arkansans suffer from the 12 highest cancer mortality rates in the US and severe disparities for breast, prostate, gynecological, and colorectal cancers.  Deeply ingrained demographic, access, and risk behavior factors contribute to these problems.  The proposed Arkansas Cancer Community Network (AR-CCN) seeks to build upon past experiences and accomplishments of the Arkansas Special Populations Access Network (ASPAN) to continue addressing these issues by bridging gaps from discovery to development and from development to delivery of appropriate interventions.  AR-CCN's ultimate purpose is to reduce health disparities at the local level by working with communities to: discover culturally competent methods to reduce disparities; measure disparity reduction; apply this information through dissemination and policy development; and sustain effective interventions at local, state, and possibly national levels by implementing policies and gaining support from varied sources.  AR-CCN's overall goal is to significantly improve access to and utilization of beneficial cancer interventions in communities with cancer health disparities, thereby reducing disparities.  The aims of the AR-CCN will further develop and increase capacity building that began with ASPAN, develop community-based participatory research and training programs, and establish credibility and create sustainability for productive local networks.  Backed by experienced leadership and staffing, AR-CCN will draw upon the expertise of multiple institutional and community partners, collaborations with NCI-related programs, and effective community interventions to support integrated community-based participatory activities, enhance and increase its partnerships and collaborations, increase use and integration of beneficial interventions, and increase leveraged non-CRCHD funds for community-based education, prevention, and screening activities to reduce cancer disparities.  CRCHD funding will enable the network to expand its training and preparation programs and develop additional pilot research projects to reduce cancer health disparities.  Experienced evaluators will determine reduction in cancer disparities at the community level while AR-CCN's team works to obtain non-CRCHD funding and provide evidence-based information to local, state, and federal decision and policy makers         ",Arkansas Cancer Community Network (ARCCN),8335649,U01CA114607,"['Cancer Intervention ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Female Reproductive System ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Tumor ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Neoplasm ', ' Gynecological Cancer ', ' Gynecologic Cancer ', ' Female Reproductive Cancer ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Training Activity ', ' Advocate ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Provider ', ' Improve Access ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' effective intervention ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Training Programs ', ' Policy Developments ', ' evidence base ', ' Leadership ', ' outreach ', ' Minority ', ' Arkansas ', ' community intervention ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Community Networks ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' programs ', ' Reporting ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Staging ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' meetings ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Communities ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Preparation ', ' Mission ', ' Research Training ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' experience ', ' Training ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Funding ', ' Methods ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Source ', ' Goals ', ' Address ', ' Participant ', ' Research Activity ', ' improved ', ' Collaborations ', ' Site ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Individual ', ' Incidence ', ' Link ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Services ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Work ', ' Procedures ', ' Measures ', ' Policies ', ' Research ', ' Phase ', ' base ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Prevention education ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,U01,2011,140000,0.05151258846583415

"Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is now the leading cause of death in the state of North Carolina. In 2006, over 17,000 North Carolinians died from cancer. African Americans carry a disproportionate burden of cancer disease, with higher mortality rates than Caucasians from prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer. The Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) will leverage the myriad successes of CCN I and continue to promote the community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in adhering to the established mission of reducing cancer health disparities among adult African Americans in North Carolina. CCN II will be based at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will provide a three-pronged research infrastructure that includes: Outreach, Research, and Training. CCN II will continue to work with faith-based and secular community groups in two regional areas in North Carolina that comprise 13 urban and rural counties. CCN II program activities will be undertaken through the coordinating efforts of the Administrative Core, the partnership strengthening activities of the Community Outreach Program and the junior faculty development activities of the Training Program to form a comprehensive, interactive, community-academic research center.   Specifically, 1) the Administrative core will provide scientific leadership and direction to all three of CCN M's programs, cultivating cohesion and synergy to meet Center goals; 2) the Community Outreach Program will provide needs assessments, culturally sensitive cancer education, and targeted health promotion and dissemination efforts in concert with existing Community Partners; 3) the Training Program will identify, instruct and support the development of early-stage investigators interested in developing their own health disparities research programs using the CBPR approach; and 4) the Research Program will support the conduct of an evidence-based intervention study to increase colorectal cancer screening rates among African Americans using data generated from CCN I preliminary research and existing partnerships.          Racial/ethnic minorities carry a greater burden of cancer than other population groups. Although there are many beneficial biomedical and behavioral services available for cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, many health disparities continue because these benefits are not shared by all.

"Asian American Liver Cancer Education Program in  Maryland    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for over half of the 1.3 million chronic Hepatitis B cases and deaths from Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the U.S. This excess risk can be attributed to high rates of HBV infection (particularly among first generation immigrants), in combination with low rates of HBV screening and vaccination due to cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers. Because of these combined risk factors, Asian Americans are often diagnosed with late stage cancer, resulting in low survival rates and high mortality rates.       In response to this cancer-related health disparity, this project seeks to develop and implement educational programs to promote HBV screening and increase awareness of liver cancer prevention of Asian Americans in Maryland. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop educational strategies tailored to the needs of target communities to increase public awareness of liver cancer prevention; 2) Implement theory-driven and culturally integrated community-based cancer intervention programs; and 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention on hepatitis B and liver cancer awareness and HBV screening behavior.       Using a randomized control design, a total 900 Asian Americans (300 Vietnamese, Koreans, and Chinese each) age 18 and older will be recruited from 12 community-based organizations (CBO). Each CBO will be randomly assigned to either an intervention (n=6) or control group (n=6). Eligible participants will complete a survey and those in the intervention groups will participate in an educational program. An immediate post survey will be issued to examine the effects of the intervention on intention to obtain HBV screening. Participants will be telephone interviewed 6 months after the intervention to assess actual screening practice. Those in the control group will receive a delayed intervention after the posttest. The insights gained from this proposed liver cancer education program will be valuable in implementing cancer intervention programs for other high risk non-English speaking populations, including economically disadvantaged minorities and will address health disparities in immigrant populations.

"Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC)    DESCRIPTION: In response to RFA CA-09-032, the Center for Asian Health of Temple University proposes to establish a regional Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) to address the cancer burden and co-morbidities among underserved Asian American populations through community outreach, research, and training. The proposed Center builds upon the successful collaborations that were fostered during the previous ATECAR SPN and ATECAR CNP-I cycles and consists of academic institutions, community organizations, and community healthcare providers. The ACCHDC will work towards the overall goal of reducing cancer health disparities by increasing knowledge of, access to and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures in underserved Asian American communities. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to guide all Center activities, which fall within four components: the Administrative Core (AC), Community Outreach Program (COP), Research Program (RP) and Training Program (TP). The AC will provide essential administrative, scientific, programmatic, and community leadership and timely coordination of Center operations. The COP will focus on building cancer control capacity and increasing knowledge and access to cancer prevention among the multi-ethnic and multilingual Asian communities in the eastern region of the US (PA, NJ and NYC). Under the RP, a large-scale controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBPR colorectal cancer (CRC) intervention in increasing screening, knowledge of, perceived risks of and susceptibility to CRC and benefits of screening, as well as reducing health system barriers to screening. The pilot study, led by a junior investigator, will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate education intervention in increasing knowledge of and intent to participate in Hepatitis B biospecimen research and examining cultural factors associated with the participation in biospecimen research. The TP will develop and implement a comprehensive research training program in CBPR methods and provide mentorship and key resources to junior researchers from racial/ethnic minority and underrepresented groups. Center team members have forged successful collaborations during ATECAR SPN and CNP-I, have established strong partnerships with Asian communities and are dedicated to the Center's mission of reducing cancer health disparities in underserved Asian Americans.             The proposed ACCHDC program will make a significant contributions toward enhancing our understanding of, and increasing our capacity to reduce, cancer health disparities among Asian Americans.

"Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC2) Center to Reduce Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Western New York (WNY) communities suffer from significant disparities in tobacco use and cessation practices, participation in research opportunities and rates of lung, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers. The proposed Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC) Center will address the most striking of these disparities and the burden of cancer in our region by focusing our efforts on minority and urban communities and clinical practices in the cities of Buffalo and Niagara Falls and rural Appalachian communities in neighboring Chautauqua County. We approach the reduction of disparities with clinical and community partnerships from a socio ecological model, with efforts to enhance social capital and reduce perceived racism. The goal of the Center is to ensure that all residents benefit from available clinical and scientific advances to reduce tobacco use, promote healthy lifestyles and behaviors, detect cancer early and participate in clinical and research programs in order to eliminate cancer inequities. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Enhance clinical environments by providing resources, training, outreach and interventions to improve the quality of clinical practice. Aim 2. Enhance outreach to the community by providing technical assistance and tailored outreach interventions to community organizations and partners to increase knowledge of, access to, and use of, beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures. Aim 3. Enhance CBPR training by provide training, mentoring, CBPR and trans-disciplinary research experiences and resources to prepare junior investigators and post-doctoral fellows. Aim 4. Conduct rigorous CBPR research by investigating variables and methods with our community partners to reduce cancer disparities.

"Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECAD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECaD) at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center, St Louis, MO of Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital was established in 2003 with institutional funds in response to known excess cancer burden within the region particularly for minority and medically underserved populations. The Goals are to create a national model for eliminating disparities In cancer through community-based partnerships and community based participatory research (CBPR); to increase access by breaking down barriers to quality cancer care; and to be a catalyst for change in our region by fostering healthy communities. Given the fractured history of St Louis and its segregation, PECaD has worked with numerous community organizations and provider groups to build trust and has harnessed resources from non federal sources and NCI. We now propose to further strengthen partnerships in the St. Louis region and extend our activities to additional areas chosen based on poverty levels; limited access to cancer screening and prevention services; excess cancer incidence or mortality; and expressed community Interest In collaborative efforts to address cancer health disparities. Our three communities are St Louis City and North County, MO; St. Clair County, IL, and southeastern Missouri. The Specific aims are: 1. In collaboration with our community partners, using the community outreach program and working with our community partnerships, we will extend and evaluate the effectiveness of outreach. 2. In a research project created in partnership with our colorectal cancer community partnership, we will design and conduct a RCT of community awareness plus systems level changes to reinforce provider behavior change to order and follow-up on colorectal cancer screening tests. 3.

"Southeast Michigan Community Network Program    DESCRIPTION: This application, in response to RFA-CA-09-032, Community Networks Program (U54), proposes to continue our vibrant, comprehensive, and sustainable program to reduce disparities in breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in southeast Michigan. Under CNP I, we have mobilized with extraordinary community partners to implement an integrated system of community-based participatory education, training, and research activities. Our regional CNP II Center will include four large urban areas severely impacted by economic hardship: Detroit, Inkster, Southfield, and Pontiac. This tri-county area accounts for 71.3% of Michigan's African American population and 42% of the state's below poverty population. In SE Michigan, older African Americans have higher rates of poverty and comorbid medical diseases related to being underserved medically (5, 6). Our team of collaborating investigators and community partners will continue to build on our established partnerships. The effort will be led by the Karmanos Cancer Institute, the School of Medicine at Wayne State University, and the Josephine Ford Cancer Center of the Henry Ford Health System. Support for our CNP I and now CNP II is broadly based, demonstrated by the community leaders, researchers, clinicians and public officials with whom we have strong relationships and who have joined our Center Steering Committee and Community Advisory Group, and have written letters of support included in this application. We propose a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach to address three aims for reducing disparities: Aim 1. To continue to increase knowledge, access and use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures to reduce disparities related to breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer, among older, underserved African American adults in southeast Michigan; Aim 2. To continue to develop and implement evidence-based intervention research to increase use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures for cancer prevention, detection and treatment of older African Americans; and Aim 3. To recruit and train a critical mass of promising and successful new researchers in CBPR to reduce cancer health disparities.          RELEVANCE (See Instructions):  Older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of cancers, are first diagnosed at advanced stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates. Our proposed CNP has high public health relevance because our goal is to continue our catalytic effort to sustain a strong community based health movement that will improve knowledge of, access to, and usage of beneficial behavioral and biomedical interventions to reduce cancer disparities and improve detection diagnosis treatment and survivorship",Southeast Michigan Community Network Program,8137962,U54CA153606,[''],NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U54,2011,1011060,-0.002003021423115957
"Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is now the leading cause of death in the state of North Carolina. In 2006, over 17,000 North Carolinians died from cancer. African Americans carry a disproportionate burden of cancer disease, with higher mortality rates than Caucasians from prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer. The Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) will leverage the myriad successes of CCN I and continue to promote the community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in adhering to the established mission of reducing cancer health disparities among adult African Americans in North Carolina. CCN II will be based at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will provide a three-pronged research infrastructure that includes: Outreach, Research, and Training. CCN II will continue to work with faith-based and secular community groups in two regional areas in North Carolina that comprise 13 urban and rural counties. CCN II program activities will be undertaken through the coordinating efforts of the Administrative Core, the partnership strengthening activities of the Community Outreach Program and the junior faculty development activities of the Training Program to form a comprehensive, interactive, community-academic research center.   Specifically, 1) the Administrative core will provide scientific leadership and direction to all three of CCN M's programs, cultivating cohesion and synergy to meet Center goals; 2) the Community Outreach Program will provide needs assessments, culturally sensitive cancer education, and targeted health promotion and dissemination efforts in concert with existing Community Partners; 3) the Training Program will identify, instruct and support the development of early-stage investigators interested in developing their own health disparities research programs using the CBPR approach; and 4) the Research Program will support the conduct of an evidence-based intervention study to increase colorectal cancer screening rates among African Americans using data generated from CCN I preliminary research and existing partnerships.          Racial/ethnic minorities carry a greater burden of cancer than other population groups. Although there are many beneficial biomedical and behavioral services available for cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, many health disparities continue because these benefits are not shared by all.

"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network -- II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network N's overarching goal is to contribute materially to: understanding the underlying causes of cancer-related health disparities; discovering and developing effective innovations to lower incidence, improving survival, and reducing suffering; delivering these innovations to high-risk populations and moving them to widespread dissemination. We focus on African Americans (AAs) in South Carolina, a group in a region with much higher-than-average cancer incidence and extraordinarily high mortality given incidence. Our goal will be realized by achieving these Specific Aims: 1. to increase the knowledge base needed to understand which biomedical and behavioral procedures are most likely to prevent and control cancer in the high-risk African-American communities in South Carolina; 2. to develop and test interventions that are likely to reduce cancer incidence, downstage disease at time of diagnosis, increase longevity, and improve quality of life in people with cancer; 3. To deliver interventions shown to be effective to places of greatest receptivity and public health need and to evaluate them in terms of generalizability (i.e., external validity); and 4. To disseminate results from successful interventions in the form of intervention ""packages"" within our communities in South Carolina and to work with national partners to determine and distinguish universal elements that will work most (or at least many) places and others that are more place- and culture-specific. The success of SCCDCN-ll is predicated on: strong community support; dedication to the principles of community-based participatory research; understanding that the philosophical underpinnings and practical methods of applying knowledge are essentially the same across interdisciplinary, translational and community-based participatory research; that the tripartite missions of research, education, and service are both inseparable and highly interdependent; and that training of the next generation of scientists dedicated to the highest ideals of community-based participatory, interdisciplinary, and translational research is necessary in order to reduce, and then finally eliminate cancer-related health disparities.              The SCCDCN-ll builds on work begun in CNP-I that allows us to expand programming to reduce, and finally eliminate entirely, cancer-related health disparities.

"Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP)     University of Washington (UW) and Black Hills Center for American Indian Health (BHCAIH) seek support for Native People for Cancer Control (NPCC), a currentiy-funded regional Community Networks Program (CNP). NPCC is organized into an Administrafive Core and Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs. Directorship of NPCC will be shared by Dedra Buchwald, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director, Partnerships for Native Health, UW; and Jeffrey Henderson (Cheyenne River Sioux), MD, MPH, President and CEO of the community-based, non-profit BHCAIH in Rapid City, SD. NPCC serves an 8-state region and is headquartered at UW in Seattle, with 3 additional sites that align geographically with the conduct of our Community Outreach Program activities. Site 1 includes Washington, Alaska, and Oregon; Site 2 includes Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming; and Site 3 includes North and South Dakota. NPCC will include 15 American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) investigators, staff, and partners. AI/ANs have the poorest 5-year sun/ival from all cancers combined among all U.S. racial/ethnic groups,(12) and access to cancer clinical trials is difficult. Our overarching aim, therefore, is to direcfiy contribute to improved cancer health outcomes and quality of life for AI/AN populations, which experience dramafic health inequities. Our central strategy is to capitalize on opportunlties and leverage existing resources to pursue an integrated, mulfifaceted research program that is catalyzed by tight partnerships with Native communities. We will address cancer health issues ranging from prevenfion and clinical trials to survivorship. Our long-term goal is to generate findings that can be translated into practices and policies that will reduce AI/AN cancer-related health disparities. Thus, our Specific Aims are to: 1) increase cancer educafion, outreach, health promotion, and prevention efforts among urban and mral AI/ANs through the activities of the Community Outreach Program; 2) conduct 1 Research Project, 2 CNP Pilot Projects, and 2 Training Projects using community-based participatory methods that focus on colorectal cancer screening, health literacy and communication, cancer risk factors and care, and clinical trials educafion among Al/ANs; 3) train at least 5 AI/AN junior faculty members to conduct research through the efforts of the Training Program; and 4) reduce cancer health disparities by increasing access to, and use of, inten/entions among AI/AN populations through all NPCC activifies. These activities will be coordinated by the Administrafive Core. With a wide network of partners, 25 funded cancer-related grants and 54 publications by NPCC-affiliated investigators, NPPC has the essential elements of a successful CNP, both as an individual site and as a member ofthe CNP network.        Healthy People 2010 focuses on health disparities, yet progress reports revealed minimal improvement for Al/ANs in areas previously identified as problematic. For example, only 62% of AI/ANs had health insurance, virtually unchanged over the previous 4 years, and life expectancy for AI/ANs was up to 8 years shorter than for non-Al/ANs.

"P.L.A.N.E.T. MassCONECT to Promote Evidence-Based Interventions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community partnerships provide a key vehicle for dissemination of evidence-based interventions to promote cancer prevention. Despite fundamental advances in the development of evidence-based interventions, there are significant gaps in translation of this knowledge. In particular, little is known about the barriers faced by community groups in adopting successful evidence-based interventions and how dissemination can be accomplished in community settings. Even less is known about the adoption of these interventions by groups working with the underserved. The goal of our proposed project is to test a community participatory model for dissemination of evidence- based cancer prevention interventions by combining the elements of a national resource, the Cancer Control PLANET, and our close collaborative relationships with community partners developed through MassCONECT, a NCI-funded Community Network Program intervening to reduce cancer disparities in three Massachusetts communities: Boston, Lawrence & Worcester. Using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles as the central guiding framework, we will promote the adoption of our intervention called PLANET MassCONECT, a web portal that adopts the national resource to local conditions. This community participatory model includes several key steps: (1) to seek community input from the Community Project Advisory Committee (C-PAC) and through formative research to assess community- specific factors influencing adoption of the PLANET; and (2) establish a dedicated, customized web portal, PLANET MassCONECT, that presents useable information organized to prevent information overload. To test the model, we will examine if the provision of three types of capital } human capital (community health educators serving as technical resources and workshops to train community members), social capital (communications among potential users leading to social capital), and financial capital (modest infrastructure support and pilot intervention grants) } will increase the organizational capacity to plan, adopt and implement evidence-based cancer control interventions in communities of three different sizes and structures. The outcomes of interest are collective efficacy, use of PLANET MassCONECT, PLANET reach, program planning and program adoption. We plan to disseminate the intervention, if successful, using two national cancer prevention networks funded by NCI and CDC, NCI's Cancer Information Service and the American Cancer Society. This study builds from a solid foundation of collaboration among community, academic and national partners to advance our understanding of dissemination of evidence-based interventions through community-based participatory approach.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of PLANET MassCONECT is to design and test a model of dissemination of evidenced-based cancer-control interventions for adoption by community groups who serve the underserved in three Massachusetts communities - Boston, Lawrence, and Worcester. From research on health interventions, we know much about what should be done to promote health and prevent diseases, yet know little about how to translate those interventions into real world settings. The PLANET MassCONECT study will follow a community participatory model, allowing us to address the many barriers to successful dissemination, and is focused on building community capacity to ensure sustainability.

"Participatory Design of a Text Message System to Support Community Health Advisor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer mortality is continuing to decline in the United States; however, African Americans and people with low income and/or education have the highest rates of both new cancers and cancer deaths. The differences in knowledge of cancer risks and possessing misinformation may be a potential contributing factor to cancer health disparities. Due to the unequal burden of cancer among African Americans, the Deep South Network (DSN) for Cancer Control was established in early 2000 to establish sustainable community infrastructure in order to promote cancer awareness and to develop and test innovative, community-based cancer control measures to eliminate cancer mortality disparities among African Americans in Alabama and Mississippi. Community Health Advisors as Research Partners (CHARPs) were trained to deliver cancer awareness activities in their community and to serve as partners in the coordination of community-based research. With the emergence of technology that allows individuals' increased access to information, the development of health promotion programs, e.g. smoking cessation, physical activity, weight management, which use the short messaging service (SMS), or text messaging function of the mobile phone, have shown many positive outcomes. By providing CHARPs with a mobile phone SMS system, CHARPs can have access to accurate and up-to-date cancer health information through synchronous, real-time, communication to community members. The overall goal of the project is to develop and pilot test an innovative, interactive SMS application designed to provide cancer health information and a support network for the DSN CHARPs. The project will be guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This theory suggests that when a user is presented with a new technology, a number of factors (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use) influence her decision about how and when she will use the technology. The specific aims are: to conduct extensive formative research among DSN CHARPs in order to assess the feasibility and acceptability of SMS technology to deliver information and identify cancer information needs; to collaborate with DSN CHARPs to draft and evaluate text messages to be included in the SMS database in order to develop a prototype SMS system aimed at providing cancer information; and to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of the SMS system for delivering cancer information through CHARPs. Results from this study will provide a basis for more extended research in the field of cancer health disparities and mobile phone technology. In addition, a greater understanding of how to distribute cancer health information to those in rural and low resource areas will lead to improved interventions.           Narrative The development of a text messaging system can be used to overcome barriers to obtaining cancer health information across socio-economic groups.

"Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC2) Center to Reduce Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Western New York (WNY) communities suffer from significant disparities in tobacco use and cessation practices, participation in research opportunities and rates of lung, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers. The proposed Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC) Center will address the most striking of these disparities and the burden of cancer in our region by focusing our efforts on minority and urban communities and clinical practices in the cities of Buffalo and Niagara Falls and rural Appalachian communities in neighboring Chautauqua County. We approach the reduction of disparities with clinical and community partnerships from a socio ecological model, with efforts to enhance social capital and reduce perceived racism. The goal of the Center is to ensure that all residents benefit from available clinical and scientific advances to reduce tobacco use, promote healthy lifestyles and behaviors, detect cancer early and participate in clinical and research programs in order to eliminate cancer inequities. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Enhance clinical environments by providing resources, training, outreach and interventions to improve the quality of clinical practice. Aim 2. Enhance outreach to the community by providing technical assistance and tailored outreach interventions to community organizations and partners to increase knowledge of, access to, and use of, beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures. Aim 3. Enhance CBPR training by provide training, mentoring, CBPR and trans-disciplinary research experiences and resources to prepare junior investigators and post-doctoral fellows. Aim 4.

"Community Networks Program: The Johns Hopkins Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under the direction of its community partners within Baltimore City and Prince George's County, the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center proposes to formally establish the ""Community Networks Program (CNP): The Johns Hopkins Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities."" The proposed Center arises from an established community-academic practice partnership that has been active across the two counties, in delivery of cancer screening services, and in research. These predominantly African American counties differ in socio economic status, but both experience disproportionate mortality due to breast, cervix and colorectal cancer. The objective of this proposal is to create an infrastructure to support community-driven research that creates training opportunities for early-stage investigators. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To establish an Administrative Core to provide leadership for the Center's overall strategic planning, including scientific leader-ship-and-oversight-on using-the-GBPR approach and its core-principles; 2) To develop a Community- Outreach Program that leverages existing community outreach initiatives targeted to multiethnic underserved populations in Baltimore City and Prince George's County; 3) To implement a Research Program consisting of two projects: a) the Full Research Project, ""Evaluating Coaches of Older Adults for Cancer Care and Healthy Behaviors (COACH)"", a randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of trained, participant designated coaches vs. professionally-based navigators, in supporting adherence to cancer screening; and b) the Pilot Educational Research Project, a mixed-methods study that examines knowledge, attitudes and willingness of multiethnic older adults to participate in a cancer-related biospecimen repository; 4) To establish a Training Program with the primary goal of increasing the number of qualified health disparity researchers experienced in using CBPR in the context of cancer disparities. The CNP Center at Johns Hopkins will create a sustainable infrastructure for community based participatory research on a large, multiple project, highly collaborative scale, It will increase knowledge of, access to, and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures related to cancer in areas ranging from prevention to early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.

"Identifying Disparities in Type 2 Diabetes Among Asian Americans: The Pan Asian C    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the Asian American population has grown dramatically in size and diversity in recent decades, there are wide gaps in our knowledge of health and healthcare for this population. Asian subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) are often aggregated in clinical and population-based studies because of small numbers in any one subgroup. In particular, data are lacking on Type 2 diabetes and obesity for Asian Americans, suggested to have increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. Moreover, no data explains whether this applies equally for all Asian American subgroups. The prevalence of obesity, pre-diabetes, diabetes and the diabetic complications of diabetes are largely unknown in specific Asian subgroups. There is also a controversy about how obesity should be defined for Asians. In 2004, the World Health Organization recommended lower body mass index (BMI) cut points to define overweight and obesity for people of Asian descent worldwide. However the evidence on which this is based is debatable, and it is possible that this association will be different in Asian subgroups living in the U.S. It is also unknown if risk factors for diabetes are similarly predictive for Asian American subgroups and Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Better information is needed concerning screening, incidence, prevalence, risk factors, natural history of obesity and diabetes, and healthcare and patient factors that affect treatment disparities for Asian American subgroups. This application aims to examine diabetes screening, risk and care both to fill gaps in knowledge of diabetes disparities and to inform clinical decision making regarding screening and healthcare for Asian Americans. We propose to construct a mixed historical and prospective longitudinal cohort by linking existing clinical databases in a large (20,000), multiethnic sample of contemporary Asians in California. We will define Asian subgroups through self-report, and will include a sample of NHWs for comparison. Use of electronic health records in this epidemiologic study will allow highly cost efficient assembly and follow-up of this cohort. The overall goal of this application is to address a substantial gap in existing knowledge regarding diabetes risk in Asian racial/ethnic minorities. This study will provide a greater understanding of diabetes among Asian ethnic minorities in a comparable environment, and would contribute both to a global understanding of risk for Asian populations and to more targeted research, public health and clinical efforts throughout the U.S.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Limited information is available about diabetes among Asians, one of the nation's fastest growing minority groups.

This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement.          At a time of reduced resources, low income populations who are uninsured and of limited English proficiency bear a disproportionate share of the burden of cancer. This CNP will provide the opportunity to increase collaboration between communities of color, academic institutions and health serving organizations to make more efficient use of existing

"Access to care in Asian Americans: Assessing determinants of usual source of care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As one of the most diverse and the fastest growing minority population in the United States, understanding the resources and barriers that impact the health and health behaviors of Asian Americans is increasingly prioritized in the national health agenda. Persistent inequities in access to care highlight the need for systematic assessment of the intricate factors influencing health, especially those related to acculturation, or the long-term psychosocial and cultural effects of immigration. Having a usual source of care is an especially important measure of equity in access because of its associations with better health outcomes and utilization with preventative and primary care services. However, the little empirical research conducted on how key resources and barriers contribute to access to care for Asian Americans lacks clarity. Findings have been largely inconsistent and often do not account for unique patterns in access to care among Asian American subgroups. The broad research goals of this study to determine whether the determinants of usual source of care differs for Asian Americans, specifically, how acculturation and other predisposing and enabling resources impact usual source of care, and whether Asian American ethnicity influences the relationships of these factors on usual source of care. Two specific Aims align with the broad research goals. Specific Aim 1 seeks assess how the direct and indirect associations of acculturation and key predisposing and enabling resources affects the likelihood of having a usual source of care in Asian American adults compared to non-Hispanic white adults. Specific Aim 2 seeks to examine usual source of care by Asian American ethnic subgroups (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, South Asian, and Vietnamese) and to assess the interrelationships among acculturation, predisposing and enabling resources, and usual source of care for two important AA groups with distinct migration histories, Chinese and Vietnamese Americans. This study will fill the critical gaps in literature on the measurement and determinants of usual source of care among Asian Americans and Asian subgroups. This study will use both multivariate logistic regression and path analysis to more clearly specify how acculturation directly and indirectly influences enabling resources and having a usual source of care among Asian Americans. Findings from this study can facilitate the development of targeted interventions to promote effective health seeking behavior for underserved Asian American groups. This study draws on the California Health Interview Survey, a rich, representative, statewide, cross- sectional dataset that provides adequate sample size for Asian subgroups and detailed Asian ethnicity and demographic information that is necessary to understand the resources and barriers that Asian Americans face when accessing care. By examining Asian Americans, this study highlights differences and determinants of access to care for Asian Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites. By examining Asian American subgroups, this study highlights the heterogeneity inherent in the Asian American population. Better understanding of how immigration and acculturation impacts access to care will help policy and decision makers and community workers target attention and scarce resources to most effectively reduce inequalities in access to care.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed study will address an important health equity issue among Asian Americans and Asian American subgroups. This study will broaden the understanding of variations and underlying mechanisms of access to care by assessing key determinants (individual- and community-level acculturation, and predisposing and enabling resources) among Asian American adults. This study is expected to generate new knowledge to support policymakers, providers, and community workers in better targeting their activities to improve access to care for the understudied and underserved Asian American population.              This proposed study will address an important health equity issue among Asian Americans and Asian American subgroups.

"Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is now the leading cause of death in the state of North Carolina. In 2006, over 17,000 North Carolinians died from cancer. African Americans carry a disproportionate burden of cancer disease, with higher mortality rates than Caucasians from prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer. The Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) will leverage the myriad successes of CCN I and continue to promote the community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in adhering to the established mission of reducing cancer health disparities among adult African Americans in North Carolina. CCN II will be based at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will provide a three-pronged research infrastructure that includes: Outreach, Research, and Training. CCN II will continue to work with faith-based and secular community groups in two regional areas in North Carolina that comprise 13 urban and rural counties. CCN II program activities will be undertaken through the coordinating efforts of the Administrative Core, the partnership strengthening activities of the Community Outreach Program and the junior faculty development activities of the Training Program to form a comprehensive, interactive, community-academic research center.   Specifically, 1) the Administrative core will provide scientific leadership and direction to all three of CCN M's programs, cultivating cohesion and synergy to meet Center goals; 2) the Community Outreach Program will provide needs assessments, culturally sensitive cancer education, and targeted health promotion and dissemination efforts in concert with existing Community Partners; 3) the Training Program will identify, instruct and support the development of early-stage investigators interested in developing their own health disparities research programs using the CBPR approach; and 4) the Research Program will support the conduct of an evidence-based intervention study to increase colorectal cancer screening rates among African Americans using data generated from CCN I preliminary research and existing partnerships.          Racial/ethnic minorities carry a greater burden of cancer than other population groups. Although there are many beneficial biomedical and behavioral services available for cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, many health disparities continue because these benefits are not shared by all.

"Minnesota Community Networks Center For Eliminating Cancer Disparaties DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this application is to establish a Regional Community Networks Program known as the Minnesota Community Networks Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities among racial/ethnic minority populations in Minnesota with an initial focus on Minnesota's growing new immigrant and refugee populations using Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach. While Minnesota is often perceived to have few minorities, the state's racial/ethnic distribution has changed substantially. Between 1990 and 2008, African Americans in Minnesota grew from 94,944 to 225,648 (138% growth) Latinos grew from 53,884 to 200,736 (273% growth), Asians grew from 77,886 to 180,835 (132% growth), compared to whites who grew from 4,130,395 to 4,559,336 (10% growth). During the same period, the population of foreign-born individuals in Minnesota increased from 260,000 to 340,000. The proposed Center will build on existing statewide cancer prevention and control infrastructure known as Minnesota Cancer Alliance, and on established successful university-community partnerships. In addition to the CNP headquarters at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, the Center will have sites in Willmar (West Central) and Owatonna (Southern), both rural communities in Minnesota. The proposed CNP center will comprise of four cores: Administrative Core, Community Outreach Core, Research Core, and Training Core. The Administrative Core will provide overall leadership and organizational infrastructure for the Center; the Community Outreach Core will collaborate with established partners. New American Community Services (African immigrants) and Centro Campesino (Latino immigrants) increasing community members' awareness of, knowledge about, and access to cervical and breast cancer screening; the Research Core will support one full project (tobacco use) and one pilot research project (cervical cancer screening); the Training Core will prepare a cadre of scientists and health professionals with focus on underrepresented groups across Minnesota to incorporate CBPR into their cancer research and promote their capacity to achieve sustained career success as community-engaged health disparity researchers.

"Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECAD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECaD) at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center, St Louis, MO of Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital was established in 2003 with institutional funds in response to known excess cancer burden within the region particularly for minority and medically underserved populations. The Goals are to create a national model for eliminating disparities In cancer through community-based partnerships and community based participatory research (CBPR); to increase access by breaking down barriers to quality cancer care; and to be a catalyst for change in our region by fostering healthy communities. Given the fractured history of St Louis and its segregation, PECaD has worked with numerous community organizations and provider groups to build trust and has harnessed resources from non federal sources and NCI. We now propose to further strengthen partnerships in the St. Louis region and extend our activities to additional areas chosen based on poverty levels; limited access to cancer screening and prevention services; excess cancer incidence or mortality; and expressed community Interest In collaborative efforts to address cancer health disparities. Our three communities are St Louis City and North County, MO; St. Clair County, IL, and southeastern Missouri. The Specific aims are: 1. In collaboration with our community partners, using the community outreach program and working with our community partnerships, we will extend and evaluate the effectiveness of outreach. 2. In a research project created in partnership with our colorectal cancer community partnership, we will design and conduct a RCT of community awareness plus systems level changes to reinforce provider behavior change to order and follow-up on colorectal cancer screening tests. 3. In our pilot educational research project created with our prostate cancer community partnership, we will evaluate barriers and facilitators to participation in prostate CA tissue collection for research (biobanking). 4. Through our training program, provide CBPR training for researchers and community members collaborating with the program and institute an ongoing process for Identifying and vetting future pilot projects. 5. In conjunction with our community Disparities Elimination Advisory Committee (DEAC), we will develop a framework for evaluation within and across our Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs.          Excess cancer mortality In low income, minority and underserved populations will be addressed through community based participatory research projects that bring prevention information and access to 3 high risk populations. In addition a research project addressing disparities in access to colorectal cancer screening will be Implemented and evaluated along with education and training program s to Increase expertise among junior investigators addressing cancer health disparities.",Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECAD),8547221,U54CA153460,[''],NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U54,2012,50000,0.020359993803235225
"Identifying Disparities in Type 2 Diabetes Among Asian Americans: The Pan Asian C    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the Asian American population has grown dramatically in size and diversity in recent decades, there are wide gaps in our knowledge of health and healthcare for this population. Asian subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) are often aggregated in clinical and population-based studies because of small numbers in any one subgroup. In particular, data are lacking on Type 2 diabetes and obesity for Asian Americans, suggested to have increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. Moreover, no data explains whether this applies equally for all Asian American subgroups. The prevalence of obesity, pre-diabetes, diabetes and the diabetic complications of diabetes are largely unknown in specific Asian subgroups. There is also a controversy about how obesity should be defined for Asians. In 2004, the World Health Organization recommended lower body mass index (BMI) cut points to define overweight and obesity for people of Asian descent worldwide. However the evidence on which this is based is debatable, and it is possible that this association will be different in Asian subgroups living in the U.S. It is also unknown if risk factors for diabetes are similarly predictive for Asian American subgroups and Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Better information is needed concerning screening, incidence, prevalence, risk factors, natural history of obesity and diabetes, and healthcare and patient factors that affect treatment disparities for Asian American subgroups. This application aims to examine diabetes screening, risk and care both to fill gaps in knowledge of diabetes disparities and to inform clinical decision making regarding screening and healthcare for Asian Americans. We propose to construct a mixed historical and prospective longitudinal cohort by linking existing clinical databases in a large (20,000), multiethnic sample of contemporary Asians in California. We will define Asian subgroups through self-report, and will include a sample of NHWs for comparison. Use of electronic health records in this epidemiologic study will allow highly cost efficient assembly and follow-up of this cohort. The overall goal of this application is to address a substantial gap in existing knowledge regarding diabetes risk in Asian racial/ethnic minorities. This study will provide a greater understanding of diabetes among Asian ethnic minorities in a comparable environment, and would contribute both to a global understanding of risk for Asian populations and to more targeted research, public health and clinical efforts throughout the U.S.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Limited information is available about diabetes among Asians, one of the nation's fastest growing minority groups. The overall goal of this application is to address a substantial gap in existing knowledge about diabetes in Asians.

"P.L.A.N.E.T. MassCONECT to Promote Evidence-Based Interventions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community partnerships provide a key vehicle for dissemination of evidence-based interventions to promote cancer prevention. Despite fundamental advances in the development of evidence-based interventions, there are significant gaps in translation of this knowledge. In particular, little is known about the barriers faced by community groups in adopting successful evidence-based interventions and how dissemination can be accomplished in community settings. Even less is known about the adoption of these interventions by groups working with the underserved. The goal of our proposed project is to test a community participatory model for dissemination of evidence- based cancer prevention interventions by combining the elements of a national resource, the Cancer Control PLANET, and our close collaborative relationships with community partners developed through MassCONECT, a NCI-funded Community Network Program intervening to reduce cancer disparities in three Massachusetts communities: Boston, Lawrence & Worcester. Using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles as the central guiding framework, we will promote the adoption of our intervention called PLANET MassCONECT, a web portal that adopts the national resource to local conditions. This community participatory model includes several key steps: (1) to seek community input from the Community Project Advisory Committee (C-PAC) and through formative research to assess community- specific factors influencing adoption of the PLANET; and (2) establish a dedicated, customized web portal, PLANET MassCONECT, that presents useable information organized to prevent information overload. To test the model, we will examine if the provision of three types of capital } human capital (community health educators serving as technical resources and workshops to train community members), social capital (communications among potential users leading to social capital), and financial capital (modest infrastructure support and pilot intervention grants) } will increase the organizational capacity to plan, adopt and implement evidence-based cancer control interventions in communities of three different sizes and structures. The outcomes of interest are collective efficacy, use of PLANET MassCONECT, PLANET reach, program planning and program adoption. We plan to disseminate the intervention, if successful, using two national cancer prevention networks funded by NCI and CDC, NCI's Cancer Information Service and the American Cancer Society. This study builds from a solid foundation of collaboration among community, academic and national partners to advance our understanding of dissemination of evidence-based interventions through community-based participatory approach.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of PLANET MassCONECT is to design and test a model of dissemination of evidenced-based cancer-control interventions for adoption by community groups who serve the underserved in three Massachusetts communities - Boston, Lawrence, and Worcester. From research on health interventions, we know much about what should be done to promote health and prevent diseases, yet know little about how to translate those interventions into real world settings. The PLANET MassCONECT study will follow a community participatory model, allowing us to address the many barriers to successful dissemination, and is focused on building community capacity to ensure sustainability.

"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network -- II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network N's overarching goal is to contribute materially to: understanding the underlying causes of cancer-related health disparities; discovering and developing effective innovations to lower incidence, improving survival, and reducing suffering; delivering these innovations to high-risk populations and moving them to widespread dissemination. We focus on African Americans (AAs) in South Carolina, a group in a region with much higher-than-average cancer incidence and extraordinarily high mortality given incidence. Our goal will be realized by achieving these Specific Aims: 1. to increase the knowledge base needed to understand which biomedical and behavioral procedures are most likely to prevent and control cancer in the high-risk African-American communities in South Carolina; 2. to develop and test interventions that are likely to reduce cancer incidence, downstage disease at time of diagnosis, increase longevity, and improve quality of life in people with cancer; 3. To deliver interventions shown to be effective to places of greatest receptivity and public health need and to evaluate them in terms of generalizability (i.e., external validity); and 4. To disseminate results from successful interventions in the form of intervention ""packages"" within our communities in South Carolina and to work with national partners to determine and distinguish universal elements that will work most (or at least many) places and others that are more place- and culture-specific. The success of SCCDCN-ll is predicated on: strong community support; dedication to the principles of community-based participatory research; understanding that the philosophical underpinnings and practical methods of applying knowledge are essentially the same across interdisciplinary, translational and community-based participatory research; that the tripartite missions of research, education, and service are both inseparable and highly interdependent; and that training of the next generation of scientists dedicated to the highest ideals of community-based participatory, interdisciplinary, and translational research is necessary in order to reduce, and then finally eliminate cancer-related health disparities.              The SCCDCN-ll builds on work begun in CNP-I that allows us to expand programming to reduce, and finally eliminate entirely, cancer-related health disparities.

"Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC)    DESCRIPTION: In response to RFA CA-09-032, the Center for Asian Health of Temple University proposes to establish a regional Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) to address the cancer burden and co-morbidities among underserved Asian American populations through community outreach, research, and training. The proposed Center builds upon the successful collaborations that were fostered during the previous ATECAR SPN and ATECAR CNP-I cycles and consists of academic institutions, community organizations, and community healthcare providers. The ACCHDC will work towards the overall goal of reducing cancer health disparities by increasing knowledge of, access to and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures in underserved Asian American communities. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to guide all Center activities, which fall within four components: the Administrative Core (AC), Community Outreach Program (COP), Research Program (RP) and Training Program (TP). The AC will provide essential administrative, scientific, programmatic, and community leadership and timely coordination of Center operations. The COP will focus on building cancer control capacity and increasing knowledge and access to cancer prevention among the multi-ethnic and multilingual Asian communities in the eastern region of the US (PA, NJ and NYC). Under the RP, a large-scale controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBPR colorectal cancer (CRC) intervention in increasing screening, knowledge of, perceived risks of and susceptibility to CRC and benefits of screening, as well as reducing health system barriers to screening. The pilot study, led by a junior investigator, will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate education intervention in increasing knowledge of and intent to participate in Hepatitis B biospecimen research and examining cultural factors associated with the participation in biospecimen research. The TP will develop and implement a comprehensive research training program in CBPR methods and provide mentorship and key resources to junior researchers from racial/ethnic minority and underrepresented groups. Center team members have forged successful collaborations during ATECAR SPN and CNP-I, have established strong partnerships with Asian communities and are dedicated to the Center's mission of reducing cancer health disparities in underserved Asian Americans.             The proposed ACCHDC program will make a significant contributions toward enhancing our understanding of, and increasing our capacity to reduce, cancer health disparities among Asian Americans. In addition, the program has great potential for serving as a model program that can be implemented in other communities to achieve the NCI strategic goal of reaching underserved communities touched by cancer.",Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC),8528039,U54CA153513,"['Asian Americans ', ' Attitude ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chinese American ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Health Education ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Generations ', ' falls ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cervical ', ' Area ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' psychosocial ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' cancer risk ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' Korean American ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Qualifying ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Outreach Research ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' forging ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based program ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' operation ', ' ']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,U54,2012,50000,0.08231426612485664
"Deep South Network for Cancer Control    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Deep South Network for Cancer Control (DSNCC) focuses on some of the most impoverished and underserved areas in the US. The rural MS Delta, AL Black Belt and inner city of Birmingham, AL and Hattiesburg, Laurel, MS have exceptionally high rates of cancer mortality, cancer disparity and obesity. The DSNCC has for 9 yrs systematically addressed the major cancer health concerns of these areas. A community based infrastructure was established that in collaboration with three academic institutions addressed disparity in cervical and breast cancer screening and more recently in colorectal cancer screening, lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating. During this period we have expanded our community infrastructure in our targeted areas to include a Community Network Partnership (CNP) in each county. Building upon our community-academic partnership, our success in promoting cancer screening, increasing physical activity and incorporating healthy eating into churches, we have the following overall Specific Aims: 1-Through the Community Outreach Core, promote screening for breast, cervix, and colorectal cancer and increased physical activity and healthy eating through a community based participatory approach that includes development of a Community Action Plan that targets all levels of the socio-ecological model; 2-   through the Research Core develop, implement, and evaluate the efficacy of a community-based,   participatory, culturally-relevant intervention to reduce body weight among African American women residing in rural communities in the Deep South through a group randomized trial. Also, develop, implement, and disseminate the results of 3 pilot projects that address the needs of the community as well as the NCI requirements, with the first having a primary focus of addressing the need of revisiting the current colorectal cancer screening guidelines for African Americans; 3-through the Training Core train a cadre of new investigators who are committed to community based participatory research (CBPR) to eliminate cancer health disparities. The activities of these cores will be coordinated by an Administrative Core.          This is a highly relevant project that addresses an African-American population in a geographic location that suffers disproportionately from cancer, obesity and related co-morbidities.

"South Asian Health: From Research to Practice and Policy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary The number of South Asians in the United States has grown tremendously in the past decades, and now stands at over 2.5 million. This population, which hails largely from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, has staggering cardiovascular and cancer risk. Although diverse, it often faces tremendous cultural, socioeconomic, linguistic and structural obstacles to achieving good health. Coupled with this is a paucity of detailed data on the populations' unique cardiovascular and cancer risk profiles, etiologic mechanisms, and effective interventions to address the health disparities affecting first and second- generation South Asians in the United States. This data gap compels a convening of those who are working in these areas to develop more targeted research and evidence-based practice and policy. Two leaders in the field, the South Asian Health Initiative (SAHI), a community based participatory research program in New York, co-directed by the Center for Immigrant Health and Cancer Disparities (CIHCD) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and the South Asian Council for Social Services (SACSS), and the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Research Institute (PAMFRI) in California, are thus partnering to bring together the first national South Asian translational research convening, South Asian Health: From Research to Practice and Policy, to take place in New York City on September 20th, 2013. This one day invitational conference will join a multidisciplinary group of researchers, community members, and practitioners in medicine, nursing, health policy, social science, public health, and economics to partner in a multi-faceted South Asian health disparities research review to identify gaps and synergies, and to develop a blueprint for future research priorities. Conference planning efforts will be led by a robust Steering Committee consisting of national and international experts in South Asian health disparities research and practice, and community leaders. They will advise all aspects of conference planning and execution, which will lead to a blueprint for a translational research agenda and action on cardiovascular disease and cancer in the South Asian community. The convening will include approximately 50 invited experts, and a group of observers, who will participate in working group sessions divided by themes: genetic risk and metabolic syndrome; smokeless tobacco use; inflammation, infection, and exposure; and health care access. The conference will be truly translational in nature, bridging outreach and education, research, practice, and policy. Five post-conference community town hall meetings, in New York, San Francisco, and Chicago, will extend the conference's interactions with the community. The meetings will utilize a modified Delphi process to further engage the SA community in identifying research and service priorities, facilitate the development of the research blueprint, and disseminate conference findings. The working group sessions and the community town hall meetings will be the foundation for a yearlong collaborative effort to chart a blueprint for South Asian health disparities translational research and action, and to develop resultant research programs. The work will culminate in a special supplement in the Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: South Asian Health: From Research to Practice and Policy will review current research, identify gaps, and develop an action agenda moving forward to address the staggering cardiovascular disease and cancer risk in the large, growing South Asian communities in the United States.

"Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC2) Center to Reduce Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Western New York (WNY) communities suffer from significant disparities in tobacco use and cessation practices, participation in research opportunities and rates of lung, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers. The proposed Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC) Center will address the most striking of these disparities and the burden of cancer in our region by focusing our efforts on minority and urban communities and clinical practices in the cities of Buffalo and Niagara Falls and rural Appalachian communities in neighboring Chautauqua County. We approach the reduction of disparities with clinical and community partnerships from a socio ecological model, with efforts to enhance social capital and reduce perceived racism. The goal of the Center is to ensure that all residents benefit from available clinical and scientific advances to reduce tobacco use, promote healthy lifestyles and behaviors, detect cancer early and participate in clinical and research programs in order to eliminate cancer inequities. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Enhance clinical environments by providing resources, training, outreach and interventions to improve the quality of clinical practice. Aim 2. Enhance outreach to the community by providing technical assistance and tailored outreach interventions to community organizations and partners to increase knowledge of, access to, and use of, beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures. Aim 3. Enhance CBPR training by provide training, mentoring, CBPR and trans-disciplinary research experiences and resources to prepare junior investigators and post-doctoral fellows. Aim 4. Conduct rigorous CBPR research by investigating variables and methods with our community partners to reduce cancer disparities.

"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network -- II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network N's overarching goal is to contribute materially to: understanding the underlying causes of cancer-related health disparities; discovering and developing effective innovations to lower incidence, improving survival, and reducing suffering; delivering these innovations to high-risk populations and moving them to widespread dissemination. We focus on African Americans (AAs) in South Carolina, a group in a region with much higher-than-average cancer incidence and extraordinarily high mortality given incidence. Our goal will be realized by achieving these Specific Aims: 1. to increase the knowledge base needed to understand which biomedical and behavioral procedures are most likely to prevent and control cancer in the high-risk African-American communities in South Carolina; 2. to develop and test interventions that are likely to reduce cancer incidence, downstage disease at time of diagnosis, increase longevity, and improve quality of life in people with cancer; 3. To deliver interventions shown to be effective to places of greatest receptivity and public health need and to evaluate them in terms of generalizability (i.e., external validity); and 4. To disseminate results from successful interventions in the form of intervention ""packages"" within our communities in South Carolina and to work with national partners to determine and distinguish universal elements that will work most (or at least many) places and others that are more place- and culture-specific. The success of SCCDCN-ll is predicated on: strong community support; dedication to the principles of community-based participatory research; understanding that the philosophical underpinnings and practical methods of applying knowledge are essentially the same across interdisciplinary, translational and community-based participatory research; that the tripartite missions of research, education, and service are both inseparable and highly interdependent; and that training of the next generation of scientists dedicated to the highest ideals of community-based participatory, interdisciplinary, and translational research is necessary in order to reduce, and then finally eliminate cancer-related health disparities.              The SCCDCN-ll builds on work begun in CNP-I that allows us to expand programming to reduce, and finally eliminate entirely, cancer-related health disparities.

"Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC)    DESCRIPTION: In response to RFA CA-09-032, the Center for Asian Health of Temple University proposes to establish a regional Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) to address the cancer burden and co-morbidities among underserved Asian American populations through community outreach, research, and training. The proposed Center builds upon the successful collaborations that were fostered during the previous ATECAR SPN and ATECAR CNP-I cycles and consists of academic institutions, community organizations, and community healthcare providers. The ACCHDC will work towards the overall goal of reducing cancer health disparities by increasing knowledge of, access to and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures in underserved Asian American communities. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to guide all Center activities, which fall within four components: the Administrative Core (AC), Community Outreach Program (COP), Research Program (RP) and Training Program (TP). The AC will provide essential administrative, scientific, programmatic, and community leadership and timely coordination of Center operations. The COP will focus on building cancer control capacity and increasing knowledge and access to cancer prevention among the multi-ethnic and multilingual Asian communities in the eastern region of the US (PA, NJ and NYC). Under the RP, a large-scale controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBPR colorectal cancer (CRC) intervention in increasing screening, knowledge of, perceived risks of and susceptibility to CRC and benefits of screening, as well as reducing health system barriers to screening. The pilot study, led by a junior investigator, will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate education intervention in increasing knowledge of and intent to participate in Hepatitis B biospecimen research and examining cultural factors associated with the participation in biospecimen research. The TP will develop and implement a comprehensive research training program in CBPR methods and provide mentorship and key resources to junior researchers from racial/ethnic minority and underrepresented groups. Center team members have forged successful collaborations during ATECAR SPN and CNP-I, have established strong partnerships with Asian communities and are dedicated to the Center's mission of reducing cancer health disparities in underserved Asian Americans.             The proposed ACCHDC program will make a significant contributions toward enhancing our understanding of, and increasing our capacity to reduce, cancer health disparities among Asian Americans.

"Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is now the leading cause of death in the state of North Carolina. In 2006, over 17,000 North Carolinians died from cancer. African Americans carry a disproportionate burden of cancer disease, with higher mortality rates than Caucasians from prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer. The Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) will leverage the myriad successes of CCN I and continue to promote the community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in adhering to the established mission of reducing cancer health disparities among adult African Americans in North Carolina. CCN II will be based at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will provide a three-pronged research infrastructure that includes: Outreach, Research, and Training. CCN II will continue to work with faith-based and secular community groups in two regional areas in North Carolina that comprise 13 urban and rural counties. CCN II program activities will be undertaken through the coordinating efforts of the Administrative Core, the partnership strengthening activities of the Community Outreach Program and the junior faculty development activities of the Training Program to form a comprehensive, interactive, community-academic research center.   Specifically, 1) the Administrative core will provide scientific leadership and direction to all three of CCN M's programs, cultivating cohesion and synergy to meet Center goals; 2) the Community Outreach Program will provide needs assessments, culturally sensitive cancer education, and targeted health promotion and dissemination efforts in concert with existing Community Partners; 3) the Training Program will identify, instruct and support the development of early-stage investigators interested in developing their own health disparities research programs using the CBPR approach; and 4) the Research Program will support the conduct of an evidence-based intervention study to increase colorectal cancer screening rates among African Americans using data generated from CCN I preliminary research and existing partnerships.          Racial/ethnic minorities carry a greater burden of cancer than other population groups. Although there are many beneficial biomedical and behavioral services available for cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, many health disparities continue because these benefits are not shared by all.

"Deep South Network for Cancer Control    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Deep South Network for Cancer Control (DSNCC) focuses on some of the most impoverished and underserved areas in the US. The rural MS Delta, AL Black Belt and inner city of Birmingham, AL and Hattiesburg, Laurel, MS have exceptionally high rates of cancer mortality, cancer disparity and obesity. The DSNCC has for 9 yrs systematically addressed the major cancer health concerns of these areas. A community based infrastructure was established that in collaboration with three academic institutions addressed disparity in cervical and breast cancer screening and more recently in colorectal cancer screening, lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating. During this period we have expanded our community infrastructure in our targeted areas to include a Community Network Partnership (CNP) in each county. Building upon our community-academic partnership, our success in promoting cancer screening, increasing physical activity and incorporating healthy eating into churches, we have the following overall Specific Aims: 1-Through the Community Outreach Core, promote screening for breast, cervix, and colorectal cancer and increased physical activity and healthy eating through a community based participatory approach that includes development of a Community Action Plan that targets all levels of the socio-ecological model; 2-   through the Research Core develop, implement, and evaluate the efficacy of a community-based,   participatory, culturally-relevant intervention to reduce body weight among African American women residing in rural communities in the Deep South through a group randomized trial. Also, develop, implement, and disseminate the results of 3 pilot projects that address the needs of the community as well as the NCI requirements, with the first having a primary focus of addressing the need of revisiting the current colorectal cancer screening guidelines for African Americans; 3-through the Training Core train a cadre of new investigators who are committed to community based participatory research (CBPR) to eliminate cancer health disparities. The activities of these cores will be coordinated by an Administrative Core.          This is a highly relevant project that addresses an African-American population in a geographic location that suffers disproportionately from cancer, obesity and related co-morbidities.

"Community Networks Program: The Johns Hopkins Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under the direction of its community partners within Baltimore City and Prince George's County, the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center proposes to formally establish the ""Community Networks Program (CNP): The Johns Hopkins Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities."" The proposed Center arises from an established community-academic practice partnership that has been active across the two counties, in delivery of cancer screening services, and in research. These predominantly African American counties differ in socio economic status, but both experience disproportionate mortality due to breast, cervix and colorectal cancer. The objective of this proposal is to create an infrastructure to support community-driven research that creates training opportunities for early-stage investigators. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To establish an Administrative Core to provide leadership for the Center's overall strategic planning, including scientific leader-ship-and-oversight-on using-the-GBPR approach and its core-principles; 2) To develop a Community- Outreach Program that leverages existing community outreach initiatives targeted to multiethnic underserved populations in Baltimore City and Prince George's County; 3) To implement a Research Program consisting of two projects: a) the Full Research Project, ""Evaluating Coaches of Older Adults for Cancer Care and Healthy Behaviors (COACH)"", a randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of trained, participant designated coaches vs. professionally-based navigators, in supporting adherence to cancer screening; and b) the Pilot Educational Research Project, a mixed-methods study that examines knowledge, attitudes and willingness of multiethnic older adults to participate in a cancer-related biospecimen repository; 4) To establish a Training Program with the primary goal of increasing the number of qualified health disparity researchers experienced in using CBPR in the context of cancer disparities. The CNP Center at Johns Hopkins will create a sustainable infrastructure for community based participatory research on a large, multiple project, highly collaborative scale, It will increase knowledge of, access to, and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures related to cancer in areas ranging from prevention to early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.

"Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Regional CNP located in Alameda County, California the home to one and a half million people and the most diverse county in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has large populations of Asian American (25%), Hispanic Americans (22%), African Americans (17%), and a decreasing Euro-American population (37%), and is the home of the largest group of Afghan refugees in the US. This county not only has diversity in its ethnic/racial composition but also a large population of persons who are uninsured or underinsured and of limited English proficiency. This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement.          At a time of reduced resources, low income populations who are uninsured and of limited English proficiency bear a disproportionate share of the burden of cancer.

"Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the United States. Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take part in cancer prevention and screening activities than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. The overall goal of this project is to work collaboratively with regional partners to reduce cancer disparities. It is the long-term goal of this proposed Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to reduce the cancer disparities experienced by Hispanics in the two regions selected for this project. Our short-term objectives are to:   1. Develop and enhance our existing relationships with community partners in Regions 1 and 2 to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos and members of the Yakama Nation (Administrative Core)   2. Increase health promotion outreach and cancer screening activities among Latinos and members of   the Yakama Nation (Outreach Core); 3. Increase cervical cancer screening among Latinas using a rigorous research project (Research Core); 4. Develop and assess the feasibility of a sustainable support system for cancer patients and survivors (research Core); and 5. Train junior investigators, especially underrepresented minorities, in grant writing and CBPR to reduce cancer disparities.    This proposed Community Networks Program (CNP) builds on our existing CNP (2005 - 2010). It proposes to add a randomized clinical trial to assess two different approaches to motivate cervical cancer screening. Further it adds a patient navigator approach to reduce time to follow-up of an abnormal pap test. The pilot project builds on existing community concerns. Through its outreach core, the proposed Center will spread information and support at the population level. The training core will help train a new generation of scientists in CBPR and scientific research. Through its four cores, the proposed Center will cover a myriad of cancer disparities and assist NCI in its endeavor to reduce such disparities.             Latinos are at high risk for specific types of cancer and have a higher mortality rate for other types of cancer.

"Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is now the leading cause of death in the state of North Carolina. In 2006, over 17,000 North Carolinians died from cancer. African Americans carry a disproportionate burden of cancer disease, with higher mortality rates than Caucasians from prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer. The Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) will leverage the myriad successes of CCN I and continue to promote the community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in adhering to the established mission of reducing cancer health disparities among adult African Americans in North Carolina. CCN II will be based at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will provide a three-pronged research infrastructure that includes: Outreach, Research, and Training. CCN II will continue to work with faith-based and secular community groups in two regional areas in North Carolina that comprise 13 urban and rural counties. CCN II program activities will be undertaken through the coordinating efforts of the Administrative Core, the partnership strengthening activities of the Community Outreach Program and the junior faculty development activities of the Training Program to form a comprehensive, interactive, community-academic research center.   Specifically, 1) the Administrative core will provide scientific leadership and direction to all three of CCN M's programs, cultivating cohesion and synergy to meet Center goals; 2) the Community Outreach Program will provide needs assessments, culturally sensitive cancer education, and targeted health promotion and dissemination efforts in concert with existing Community Partners; 3) the Training Program will identify, instruct and support the development of early-stage investigators interested in developing their own health disparities research programs using the CBPR approach; and 4) the Research Program will support the conduct of an evidence-based intervention study to increase colorectal cancer screening rates among African Americans using data generated from CCN I preliminary research and existing partnerships.          Racial/ethnic minorities carry a greater burden of cancer than other population groups. Although there are many beneficial biomedical and behavioral services available for cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, many health disparities continue because these benefits are not shared by all.

"NU:  NEIGHBORS:  A Social Science Partnership to Reduce Cancer Disparities ( 1 of DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (RHLCCC-NU) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) - the only Midwestern four-year Hispanic Serving Institution are partnering to establish the NU-Northeastern Illinois Guild for Health Behavior Oncology Research & Science.  This NU NEIGHBORS application represents a strategic collaboration with the ultimate goal of reducing and eliminating cancer disparities which are prominent in Chicago. We aim to foster community-engaged, social science cancer disparities research, build a platform for public health-related curriculum modification, and create a pipeline of well-trained and experienced cancer researchers and students who choose health and science-related careers. NEIU has evolved into a comprehensive university with a track record of training highly qualified bachelor's and master's-level students for professional careers in the social sciences, education, and science fields. Complementary to NEIU strengths, RHLCCC-NU conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research with an excess of $158 million in annual extramural funding and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  This synergy will facilitate accomplishment of the following objectives: 1) to expose NEIU faculty and students to research conducted at RHLCCC-NU in the areas of medical social sciences, community engagement and health disparities; 2) to enhance RHLCCC-NU and NEIUs collaborative research efforts and networking opportunities through increased participation in conferences and symposia; 3) to introduce cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research principles through workshops, seminars, lectures, community/university outreach, and academic instruction; 4) to incorporate team-based research projects that will generate a steady pipeline of students to continue advanced studies; 5) to incorporate innovative experience-learning curricular modifications to expose students to cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research; and 6) to develop scientists who will succeed in securing funding that addresses cancer disparities. We propose a three-pronged approach to achieve these objectives.  First, in the initial planning phase, we will establish our administrative leadership and a community steering committee (CSC) focused on integrating scientific research training, education modification, and community engagement throughout the 4 years of this effort. Second, administrative leadership and the CSC will work to set priorities. Finally, during the implementation stage, we will conduct a series of NEIU-NU pilot research and education projects meant to develop into competitive and collaborative research and training grants and a larger U54 MSI-CCC Partnership Grant. Collectively, these efforts will engage the diverse faculty and student populations at NEIU and NU into a cohesive network of cancer-related social sciences research and education aimed at reducing cancer health disparities. RELEVANCE: The presence of major cancer health disparities in Chicago is well-documented, and this proposed partnership poses a unique approach to reduce deeply-engrained disparities.

"Deep South Network for Cancer Control    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Deep South Network for Cancer Control (DSNCC) focuses on some of the most impoverished and underserved areas in the US. The rural MS Delta, AL Black Belt and inner city of Birmingham, AL and Hattiesburg, Laurel, MS have exceptionally high rates of cancer mortality, cancer disparity and obesity. The DSNCC has for 9 yrs systematically addressed the major cancer health concerns of these areas. A community based infrastructure was established that in collaboration with three academic institutions addressed disparity in cervical and breast cancer screening and more recently in colorectal cancer screening, lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating. During this period we have expanded our community infrastructure in our targeted areas to include a Community Network Partnership (CNP) in each county. Building upon our community-academic partnership, our success in promoting cancer screening, increasing physical activity and incorporating healthy eating into churches, we have the following overall Specific Aims: 1-Through the Community Outreach Core, promote screening for breast, cervix, and colorectal cancer and increased physical activity and healthy eating through a community based participatory approach that includes development of a Community Action Plan that targets all levels of the socio-ecological model; 2-   through the Research Core develop, implement, and evaluate the efficacy of a community-based,   participatory, culturally-relevant intervention to reduce body weight among African American women residing in rural communities in the Deep South through a group randomized trial. Also, develop, implement, and disseminate the results of 3 pilot projects that address the needs of the community as well as the NCI requirements, with the first having a primary focus of addressing the need of revisiting the current colorectal cancer screening guidelines for African Americans; 3-through the Training Core train a cadre of new investigators who are committed to community based participatory research (CBPR) to eliminate cancer health disparities. The activities of these cores will be coordinated by an Administrative Core.          This is a highly relevant project that addresses an African-American population in a geographic location that suffers disproportionately from cancer, obesity and related co-morbidities.

"Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Regional CNP located in Alameda County, California the home to one and a half million people and the most diverse county in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has large populations of Asian American (25%), Hispanic Americans (22%), African Americans (17%), and a decreasing Euro-American population (37%), and is the home of the largest group of Afghan refugees in the US. This county not only has diversity in its ethnic/racial composition but also a large population of persons who are uninsured or underinsured and of limited English proficiency. This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement.          At a time of reduced resources, low income populations who are uninsured and of limited English proficiency bear a disproportionate share of the burden of cancer. This CNP will provide the opportunity to increase collaboration between communities of color, academic institutions and health serving organizations to make more efficient use of existing

"Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP)     University of Washington (UW) and Black Hills Center for American Indian Health (BHCAIH) seek support for Native People for Cancer Control (NPCC), a currentiy-funded regional Community Networks Program (CNP). NPCC is organized into an Administrafive Core and Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs. Directorship of NPCC will be shared by Dedra Buchwald, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director, Partnerships for Native Health, UW; and Jeffrey Henderson (Cheyenne River Sioux), MD, MPH, President and CEO of the community-based, non-profit BHCAIH in Rapid City, SD. NPCC serves an 8-state region and is headquartered at UW in Seattle, with 3 additional sites that align geographically with the conduct of our Community Outreach Program activities. Site 1 includes Washington, Alaska, and Oregon; Site 2 includes Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming; and Site 3 includes North and South Dakota. NPCC will include 15 American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) investigators, staff, and partners. AI/ANs have the poorest 5-year sun/ival from all cancers combined among all U.S. racial/ethnic groups,(12) and access to cancer clinical trials is difficult. Our overarching aim, therefore, is to direcfiy contribute to improved cancer health outcomes and quality of life for AI/AN populations, which experience dramafic health inequities. Our central strategy is to capitalize on opportunlties and leverage existing resources to pursue an integrated, mulfifaceted research program that is catalyzed by tight partnerships with Native communities. We will address cancer health issues ranging from prevenfion and clinical trials to survivorship. Our long-term goal is to generate findings that can be translated into practices and policies that will reduce AI/AN cancer-related health disparities. Thus, our Specific Aims are to: 1) increase cancer educafion, outreach, health promotion, and prevention efforts among urban and mral AI/ANs through the activities of the Community Outreach Program; 2) conduct 1 Research Project, 2 CNP Pilot Projects, and 2 Training Projects using community-based participatory methods that focus on colorectal cancer screening, health literacy and communication, cancer risk factors and care, and clinical trials educafion among Al/ANs; 3) train at least 5 AI/AN junior faculty members to conduct research through the efforts of the Training Program; and 4) reduce cancer health disparities by increasing access to, and use of, inten/entions among AI/AN populations through all NPCC activifies. These activities will be coordinated by the Administrafive Core. With a wide network of partners, 25 funded cancer-related grants and 54 publications by NPCC-affiliated investigators, NPPC has the essential elements of a successful CNP, both as an individual site and as a member ofthe CNP network.        Healthy People 2010 focuses on health disparities, yet progress reports revealed minimal improvement for Al/ANs in areas previously identified as problematic. For example, only 62% of AI/ANs had health insurance, virtually unchanged over the previous 4 years, and life expectancy for AI/ANs was up to 8 years shorter than for non-Al/ANs. Cancer morbidity, mortality, risk prevalence, and barriers to care remain major problems in Native communities. Concerted, coordinated, multidisciplinary efforts are needed to redress the striking cancer-related disparities experienced by this vulnerable population.",Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP),8318909,U54CA153498,"['Alaska ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Idaho ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Montana ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' North Dakota ', ' Oregon ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' South Dakota ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Wyoming ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Native Americans ', ' Community Networks ', ' Rivers ', ' sun ', ' The Sun ', ' programs ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' member ', ' sioux community ', ' Sioux ', ' Sioux Indians ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' outreach program ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer education ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Health Communication ', ' Research Training ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Outreach Research ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U54,2012,859372,0.02178703211876607
"Lay Health Worker Model to Reduce Liver Cancer Disparities in Asian Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is globally most common and serious viral infection of the liver. It can cause premature death from liver diseases or liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection and liver cancer caused by HBV among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) is one of the most serious - but frequently neglected-health disparity issues in the U.S. AAPIs account for over half of the 1.3 million chronic hepatitis B cases and deaths from HBV infection. This excess risk can be attributed to high rates of HBV infection (particularly among first-generation immigrants) in combination with low rates of HBV screening and vaccination due to cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers. HBV infection affect Asian Americans disproportionately, and thus it leads to a huge liver cancer disparity among Asian Americans compared to other racial/ethnic groups.  In response to these cancer disparities, the objective of this project is to build a sustainable, community-based, participator program of lay health workers (LHWs) who can promote liver cancer prevention programs among high-risk groups of Asian Americans. This proposed study attempts to implement culturally integrated liver cancer prevention programs for Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americans through outreach, screening, education, research, and training in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The specific aims are: (1) To develop a training protocol and certificate program for LHWs; (2) To assess the prevalence of HBV infection; (3) To implement intervention programs, based on screening test results; and (4) To evaluate the effectiveness of LHW intervention on adherence to HBV vaccinations among those unprotected.  A total of 600 Asian American adults (200 Chinese, Koreans, and Vietnamese in each group), 18 years of age and older will be recruited from the community. Trained and certified LHWs will recruit participants at community-based organizations and hep B free screening events. All the eligible participants will complete a self-administered questionnaire and receive liver cancer education. Then, they will receive hepatitis B test. Every participant will receive the results of screening tests by mail or phone. We will provide referral services for treatment to those infected. For those unprotected, we will implement intervention programs to increase a series of vaccinations within 6 months using a randomized controlled design. Seven months after mailing the results, we will conduct telephone interviews among those unprotected. Upon completing follow-up, those in the control will receive the delayed LHW intervention. The insights gained from this proposed LHW intervention will be valuable in implementing liver cancer prevention programs for other high-risk non-English speaking populations and will address health disparities among immigrant populations.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop and build a sustainable, community-based participatory program to promote live cancer prevention programs for Asian Americans through outreach, education, screening, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of chronic HBV infection in the Baltimore Washington Metropolitan Area.              We will develop and

"CAUSES: Causes of Asian American mortality Understood by Socio-Economic Status     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States, with a population of over 14 million that is projected to reach nearly 34 million by 2050. However, our current understanding of Asian Americans is as an aggregated group, and very little is known about the six diverse Asian American racial/ethnic subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese), who have a wide range of disease risks, immigration histories, and socioeconomic status. There is currently a knowledge gap on the health of these expanding subpopulations, and there is no information to recommend research agendas, create public health policy, and offer clinical guidelines. Our current understanding of Asian American mortality patterns is distorted by the aggregation of distinct subgroups, the grouping of foreign-born and U.S.- born populations, and the unknown impact of sociodemographic factors. While the U.S. Census first started disaggregating Asian subgroups in 1980, disaggregation of Asian subgroups on U.S. death records occurred much later in 2003, and now over half of the 50 U.S. States disaggregate Asian subgroups. The goal of this study is to examine racial/ethnic, nativity, and geographic differences in Asian American subgroup mortality compared to other racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics). Investigation of cause-specific mortality in distinct subgroups, by nativity, and considering sociodemographic factors will be fundamental in assessing and addressing health disparities in Asian American communities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The current lack of national mortality statistics for Asian American subgroups makes it difficult to recommend research agendas, create public health policy, and offer clinical guidelines for diverse Asian American subgroups. The goal of this study is to examine racial/ethnic, nativity, and geographic disparities in Asian American subgroup mortality compared to other racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics).              The current lack of national mortality statistics for Asian American subgroups makes it difficult to recommend research agendas, create public health policy, and offer clinical guidelines for diverse Asian American subgroups.

"Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECAD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECaD) at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center, St Louis, MO of Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital was established in 2003 with institutional funds in response to known excess cancer burden within the region particularly for minority and medically underserved populations. The Goals are to create a national model for eliminating disparities In cancer through community-based partnerships and community based participatory research (CBPR); to increase access by breaking down barriers to quality cancer care; and to be a catalyst for change in our region by fostering healthy communities. Given the fractured history of St Louis and its segregation, PECaD has worked with numerous community organizations and provider groups to build trust and has harnessed resources from non federal sources and NCI. We now propose to further strengthen partnerships in the St. Louis region and extend our activities to additional areas chosen based on poverty levels; limited access to cancer screening and prevention services; excess cancer incidence or mortality; and expressed community Interest In collaborative efforts to address cancer health disparities. Our three communities are St Louis City and North County, MO; St. Clair County, IL, and southeastern Missouri. The Specific aims are: 1. In collaboration with our community partners, using the community outreach program and working with our community partnerships, we will extend and evaluate the effectiveness of outreach. 2. In a research project created in partnership with our colorectal cancer community partnership, we will design and conduct a RCT of community awareness plus systems level changes to reinforce provider behavior change to order and follow-up on colorectal cancer screening tests. 3. In our pilot educational research project created with our prostate cancer community partnership, we will evaluate barriers and facilitators to participation in prostate CA tissue collection for research (biobanking). 4. Through our training program, provide CBPR training for researchers and community members collaborating with the program and institute an ongoing process for Identifying and vetting future pilot projects. 5. In conjunction with our community Disparities Elimination Advisory Committee (DEAC), we will develop a framework for evaluation within and across our Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs.          Excess cancer mortality In low income, minority and underserved populations will be addressed through community based participatory research projects that bring prevention information and access to 3 high risk populations.

This U54 application shows: 1) How the Center is administratively organized; 2)   How the Outreach Program will be implemented among 4 Asian American populations in California and  Hawaii by creating and increasing access to culturally appropriate, linguistically-specific, and evidence-based materials designed to increase knowledge about cancer and the use of beneficial preventive procedures; 3) How a 5-year Full Research Project will develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate the results of a cluster randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of lay health educators to promote colorectal cancer screening among 4 Asian American groups (Filipinos, Hmong, Korean, and Vietnamese) in 4 regions (Honolulu, Los Angeles, Sacramento, & San Francisco) and how a 2-year Pilot Research Project will assess cognitive & cultural perspectives among Chinese Americans regarding biospecimen collection; and 4) How a Training Program will develop new and early stage investigators by combining individualized mentoring plans, scheduled seminars, and a curriculum linked to the NIH Clinical & Translational Science Awards.          This application focuses on reducing the unique, unusual, and unnecessary cancer disparities that confront Asian Americans through well-conceived plans in outreach, research, and training. Asian Americans have experienced a higher population growth rate than others, in percentage terms, and are predicted to experience a triple digit increase in invasive cancers by 2030.",AANCART: The National Center for Reducing Asian American Cancer Health Disparitie,8322180,U54CA153499,"['Asian Americans ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chinese American ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Leadership ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mentors ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' Population Growth ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' San Francisco ', ' Training Programs ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Filipino ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Community Networks ', ' Staging ', ' Koreans ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' experience ', ' outreach ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Preventive ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Outreach Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U54,2012,1010841,0.11524498753988233
"Southeast Michigan Community Network Program    DESCRIPTION: This application, in response to RFA-CA-09-032, Community Networks Program (U54), proposes to continue our vibrant, comprehensive, and sustainable program to reduce disparities in breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in southeast Michigan. Under CNP I, we have mobilized with extraordinary community partners to implement an integrated system of community-based participatory education, training, and research activities. Our regional CNP II Center will include four large urban areas severely impacted by economic hardship: Detroit, Inkster, Southfield, and Pontiac. This tri-county area accounts for 71.3% of Michigan's African American population and 42% of the state's below poverty population. In SE Michigan, older African Americans have higher rates of poverty and comorbid medical diseases related to being underserved medically (5, 6). Our team of collaborating investigators and community partners will continue to build on our established partnerships. The effort will be led by the Karmanos Cancer Institute, the School of Medicine at Wayne State University, and the Josephine Ford Cancer Center of the Henry Ford Health System. Support for our CNP I and now CNP II is broadly based, demonstrated by the community leaders, researchers, clinicians and public officials with whom we have strong relationships and who have joined our Center Steering Committee and Community Advisory Group, and have written letters of support included in this application. We propose a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach to address three aims for reducing disparities: Aim 1. To continue to increase knowledge, access and use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures to reduce disparities related to breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer, among older, underserved African American adults in southeast Michigan; Aim 2. To continue to develop and implement evidence-based intervention research to increase use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures for cancer prevention, detection and treatment of older African Americans; and Aim 3. To recruit and train a critical mass of promising and successful new researchers in CBPR to reduce cancer health disparities.          RELEVANCE (See Instructions):  Older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of cancers, are first diagnosed at advanced stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates. Our proposed CNP has high public health relevance because our goal is to continue our catalytic effort to sustain a strong community based health movement that will improve knowledge of, access to, and usage of beneficial behavioral and biomedical interventions to reduce cancer disparities and improve detection diagnosis treatment and survivorship",Southeast Michigan Community Network Program,8329668,U54CA153606,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Award ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Michigan ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' survivorship ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' County ', ' Medically Uninsured ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Medically Underinsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Research Activity ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Letters ', ' Community Networks ', ' Staging ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' economic impact ', ' social ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Preventive screening ', ' Instruction ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' safety net ', ' community organizations ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U54,2012,898018,-0.002003021423115957
"Minnesota Community Networks Center For Eliminating Cancer Disparaties DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this application is to establish a Regional Community Networks Program known as the Minnesota Community Networks Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities among racial/ethnic minority populations in Minnesota with an initial focus on Minnesota's growing new immigrant and refugee populations using Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach. While Minnesota is often perceived to have few minorities, the state's racial/ethnic distribution has changed substantially. Between 1990 and 2008, African Americans in Minnesota grew from 94,944 to 225,648 (138% growth) Latinos grew from 53,884 to 200,736 (273% growth), Asians grew from 77,886 to 180,835 (132% growth), compared to whites who grew from 4,130,395 to 4,559,336 (10% growth). During the same period, the population of foreign-born individuals in Minnesota increased from 260,000 to 340,000. The proposed Center will build on existing statewide cancer prevention and control infrastructure known as Minnesota Cancer Alliance, and on established successful university-community partnerships. In addition to the CNP headquarters at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, the Center will have sites in Willmar (West Central) and Owatonna (Southern), both rural communities in Minnesota. The proposed CNP center will comprise of four cores: Administrative Core, Community Outreach Core, Research Core, and Training Core. The Administrative Core will provide overall leadership and organizational infrastructure for the Center; the Community Outreach Core will collaborate with established partners. New American Community Services (African immigrants) and Centro Campesino (Latino immigrants) increasing community members' awareness of, knowledge about, and access to cervical and breast cancer screening; the Research Core will support one full project (tobacco use) and one pilot research project (cervical cancer screening); the Training Core will prepare a cadre of scientists and health professionals with focus on underrepresented groups across Minnesota to incorporate CBPR into their cancer research and promote their capacity to achieve sustained career success as community-engaged health disparity researchers.

"Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Regional CNP located in Alameda County, California the home to one and a half million people and the most diverse county in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has large populations of Asian American (25%), Hispanic Americans (22%), African Americans (17%), and a decreasing Euro-American population (37%), and is the home of the largest group of Afghan refugees in the US. This county not only has diversity in its ethnic/racial composition but also a large population of persons who are uninsured or underinsured and of limited English proficiency. This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement.          At a time of reduced resources, low income populations who are uninsured and of limited English proficiency bear a disproportionate share of the burden of cancer. This CNP will provide the opportunity to increase collaboration between communities of color, academic institutions and health serving organizations to make more efficient use of existing

"Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is now the leading cause of death in the state of North Carolina. In 2006, over 17,000 North Carolinians died from cancer. African Americans carry a disproportionate burden of cancer disease, with higher mortality rates than Caucasians from prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer. The Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) will leverage the myriad successes of CCN I and continue to promote the community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in adhering to the established mission of reducing cancer health disparities among adult African Americans in North Carolina. CCN II will be based at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will provide a three-pronged research infrastructure that includes: Outreach, Research, and Training. CCN II will continue to work with faith-based and secular community groups in two regional areas in North Carolina that comprise 13 urban and rural counties. CCN II program activities will be undertaken through the coordinating efforts of the Administrative Core, the partnership strengthening activities of the Community Outreach Program and the junior faculty development activities of the Training Program to form a comprehensive, interactive, community-academic research center.   Specifically, 1) the Administrative core will provide scientific leadership and direction to all three of CCN M's programs, cultivating cohesion and synergy to meet Center goals; 2) the Community Outreach Program will provide needs assessments, culturally sensitive cancer education, and targeted health promotion and dissemination efforts in concert with existing Community Partners; 3) the Training Program will identify, instruct and support the development of early-stage investigators interested in developing their own health disparities research programs using the CBPR approach; and 4) the Research Program will support the conduct of an evidence-based intervention study to increase colorectal cancer screening rates among African Americans using data generated from CCN I preliminary research and existing partnerships.          Racial/ethnic minorities carry a greater burden of cancer than other population groups. Although there are many beneficial biomedical and behavioral services available for cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, many health disparities continue because these benefits are not shared by all.

"Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP)     University of Washington (UW) and Black Hills Center for American Indian Health (BHCAIH) seek support for Native People for Cancer Control (NPCC), a currentiy-funded regional Community Networks Program (CNP). NPCC is organized into an Administrafive Core and Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs. Directorship of NPCC will be shared by Dedra Buchwald, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director, Partnerships for Native Health, UW; and Jeffrey Henderson (Cheyenne River Sioux), MD, MPH, President and CEO of the community-based, non-profit BHCAIH in Rapid City, SD. NPCC serves an 8-state region and is headquartered at UW in Seattle, with 3 additional sites that align geographically with the conduct of our Community Outreach Program activities. Site 1 includes Washington, Alaska, and Oregon; Site 2 includes Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming; and Site 3 includes North and South Dakota. NPCC will include 15 American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) investigators, staff, and partners. AI/ANs have the poorest 5-year sun/ival from all cancers combined among all U.S. racial/ethnic groups,(12) and access to cancer clinical trials is difficult. Our overarching aim, therefore, is to direcfiy contribute to improved cancer health outcomes and quality of life for AI/AN populations, which experience dramafic health inequities. Our central strategy is to capitalize on opportunlties and leverage existing resources to pursue an integrated, mulfifaceted research program that is catalyzed by tight partnerships with Native communities. We will address cancer health issues ranging from prevenfion and clinical trials to survivorship. Our long-term goal is to generate findings that can be translated into practices and policies that will reduce AI/AN cancer-related health disparities. Thus, our Specific Aims are to: 1) increase cancer educafion, outreach, health promotion, and prevention efforts among urban and mral AI/ANs through the activities of the Community Outreach Program; 2) conduct 1 Research Project, 2 CNP Pilot Projects, and 2 Training Projects using community-based participatory methods that focus on colorectal cancer screening, health literacy and communication, cancer risk factors and care, and clinical trials educafion among Al/ANs; 3) train at least 5 AI/AN junior faculty members to conduct research through the efforts of the Training Program; and 4) reduce cancer health disparities by increasing access to, and use of, inten/entions among AI/AN populations through all NPCC activifies. These activities will be coordinated by the Administrafive Core. With a wide network of partners, 25 funded cancer-related grants and 54 publications by NPCC-affiliated investigators, NPPC has the essential elements of a successful CNP, both as an individual site and as a member ofthe CNP network.        Healthy People 2010 focuses on health disparities, yet progress reports revealed minimal improvement for Al/ANs in areas previously identified as problematic. For example, only 62% of AI/ANs had health insurance, virtually unchanged over the previous 4 years, and life expectancy for AI/ANs was up to 8 years shorter than for non-Al/ANs.

"Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP)     University of Washington (UW) and Black Hills Center for American Indian Health (BHCAIH) seek support for Native People for Cancer Control (NPCC), a currentiy-funded regional Community Networks Program (CNP). NPCC is organized into an Administrafive Core and Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs. Directorship of NPCC will be shared by Dedra Buchwald, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director, Partnerships for Native Health, UW; and Jeffrey Henderson (Cheyenne River Sioux), MD, MPH, President and CEO of the community-based, non-profit BHCAIH in Rapid City, SD. NPCC serves an 8-state region and is headquartered at UW in Seattle, with 3 additional sites that align geographically with the conduct of our Community Outreach Program activities. Site 1 includes Washington, Alaska, and Oregon; Site 2 includes Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming; and Site 3 includes North and South Dakota. NPCC will include 15 American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) investigators, staff, and partners. AI/ANs have the poorest 5-year sun/ival from all cancers combined among all U.S. racial/ethnic groups,(12) and access to cancer clinical trials is difficult. Our overarching aim, therefore, is to direcfiy contribute to improved cancer health outcomes and quality of life for AI/AN populations, which experience dramafic health inequities. Our central strategy is to capitalize on opportunlties and leverage existing resources to pursue an integrated, mulfifaceted research program that is catalyzed by tight partnerships with Native communities. We will address cancer health issues ranging from prevenfion and clinical trials to survivorship. Our long-term goal is to generate findings that can be translated into practices and policies that will reduce AI/AN cancer-related health disparities. Thus, our Specific Aims are to: 1) increase cancer educafion, outreach, health promotion, and prevention efforts among urban and mral AI/ANs through the activities of the Community Outreach Program; 2) conduct 1 Research Project, 2 CNP Pilot Projects, and 2 Training Projects using community-based participatory methods that focus on colorectal cancer screening, health literacy and communication, cancer risk factors and care, and clinical trials educafion among Al/ANs; 3) train at least 5 AI/AN junior faculty members to conduct research through the efforts of the Training Program; and 4) reduce cancer health disparities by increasing access to, and use of, inten/entions among AI/AN populations through all NPCC activifies. These activities will be coordinated by the Administrafive Core. With a wide network of partners, 25 funded cancer-related grants and 54 publications by NPCC-affiliated investigators, NPPC has the essential elements of a successful CNP, both as an individual site and as a member ofthe CNP network.        Healthy People 2010 focuses on health disparities, yet progress reports revealed minimal improvement for Al/ANs in areas previously identified as problematic. For example, only 62% of AI/ANs had health insurance, virtually unchanged over the previous 4 years, and life expectancy for AI/ANs was up to 8 years shorter than for non-Al/ANs. Cancer morbidity, mortality, risk prevalence, and barriers to care remain major problems in Native communities.

"Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN)    DESCRIPTION: Moffitt Cancer Center and an established network of community partners propose the formation of a regional Center for addressing the cancer burden in a tri-county area. This Center builds on the significant successes of an existing community-academic network program called the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network, draws on enriching programmatic partnerships, and builds on our considerable experience in developing innovative education, training and research programs that recognize the importance of culture and literacy in cancer care. The Center strengthens our community-based infrastructure that is currently characterized by relevant, sincere and trustworthy partnerships that serve medically underserved individuals and families, and which cuts across all racial/ethnic groups including a growing number of foreign-born populations. Grounded in methodological approaches that use community-based participatory research (CBPR), Center aims are to: increase knowledge of, access, and use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures through health promotion and outreach activities; conduct innovative evidence-based research following CBPR principles and to train qualified health disparity researchers in using CBPR approaches. The Center is   comprised of an Administrative Core that provides oversight and three highly complementary Programs   (Outreach, Research and Training) that work synergistically with members of the Steering Committee and Community Advisory Group. The Outreach Program, anchored by activities that engage communities around cancer prevention and control activities, centers on dissemination of credible resources, and makes linkages to the NCI National Outreach Network. The Research Program addresses several determinants (access, knowledge and health literacy) that impact health disparities, and offers solutions by conduct of an investigator initiated intervention research study for increasing uptake of colorectal cancer screening, and a pilot educational research project that extends the CNP Center's interests in biobanking. The Training Program draws on the tenets of mentoring, collaboration and networking, and innovatively puts into place didactic and immersion training opportunities involving academic and community mentors.             The goal of the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network is to find ways to reduce the cancer burden among medically underserved populations in our community. This will be achieved by building on an established network of community partners working collaboratively with an academic partner, the Moffitt Cancer Center, through innovative outreach, research and training activities involving community members..",Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN),8396713,U54CA153509,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Immersion ', ' Immersion Investigative Technique ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' literacy ', ' Mentors ', ' Peer Review ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Solutions ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' interest ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' outreach program ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Qualifying ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' evidence base ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Community Networks Program: The Johns Hopkins Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under the direction of its community partners within Baltimore City and Prince George's County, the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center proposes to formally establish the ""Community Networks Program (CNP): The Johns Hopkins Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities."" The proposed Center arises from an established community-academic practice partnership that has been active across the two counties, in delivery of cancer screening services, and in research. These predominantly African American counties differ in socio economic status, but both experience disproportionate mortality due to breast, cervix and colorectal cancer. The objective of this proposal is to create an infrastructure to support community-driven research that creates training opportunities for early-stage investigators. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To establish an Administrative Core to provide leadership for the Center's overall strategic planning, including scientific leader-ship-and-oversight-on using-the-GBPR approach and its core-principles; 2) To develop a Community- Outreach Program that leverages existing community outreach initiatives targeted to multiethnic underserved populations in Baltimore City and Prince George's County; 3) To implement a Research Program consisting of two projects: a) the Full Research Project, ""Evaluating Coaches of Older Adults for Cancer Care and Healthy Behaviors (COACH)"", a randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of trained, participant designated coaches vs. professionally-based navigators, in supporting adherence to cancer screening; and b) the Pilot Educational Research Project, a mixed-methods study that examines knowledge, attitudes and willingness of multiethnic older adults to participate in a cancer-related biospecimen repository; 4) To establish a Training Program with the primary goal of increasing the number of qualified health disparity researchers experienced in using CBPR in the context of cancer disparities. The CNP Center at Johns Hopkins will create a sustainable infrastructure for community based participatory research on a large, multiple project, highly collaborative scale, It will increase knowledge of, access to, and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures related to cancer in areas ranging from prevention to early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.

"Deep South Network for Cancer Control    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Deep South Network for Cancer Control (DSNCC) focuses on some of the most impoverished and underserved areas in the US. The rural MS Delta, AL Black Belt and inner city of Birmingham, AL and Hattiesburg, Laurel, MS have exceptionally high rates of cancer mortality, cancer disparity and obesity. The DSNCC has for 9 yrs systematically addressed the major cancer health concerns of these areas. A community based infrastructure was established that in collaboration with three academic institutions addressed disparity in cervical and breast cancer screening and more recently in colorectal cancer screening, lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating. During this period we have expanded our community infrastructure in our targeted areas to include a Community Network Partnership (CNP) in each county. Building upon our community-academic partnership, our success in promoting cancer screening, increasing physical activity and incorporating healthy eating into churches, we have the following overall Specific Aims: 1-Through the Community Outreach Core, promote screening for breast, cervix, and colorectal cancer and increased physical activity and healthy eating through a community based participatory approach that includes development of a Community Action Plan that targets all levels of the socio-ecological model; 2-   through the Research Core develop, implement, and evaluate the efficacy of a community-based,   participatory, culturally-relevant intervention to reduce body weight among African American women residing in rural communities in the Deep South through a group randomized trial. Also, develop, implement, and disseminate the results of 3 pilot projects that address the needs of the community as well as the NCI requirements, with the first having a primary focus of addressing the need of revisiting the current colorectal cancer screening guidelines for African Americans; 3-through the Training Core train a cadre of new investigators who are committed to community based participatory research (CBPR) to eliminate cancer health disparities. The activities of these cores will be coordinated by an Administrative Core.          This is a highly relevant project that addresses an African-American population in a geographic location that suffers disproportionately from cancer, obesity and related co-morbidities.

"Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECAD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECaD) at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center, St Louis, MO of Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital was established in 2003 with institutional funds in response to known excess cancer burden within the region particularly for minority and medically underserved populations. The Goals are to create a national model for eliminating disparities In cancer through community-based partnerships and community based participatory research (CBPR); to increase access by breaking down barriers to quality cancer care; and to be a catalyst for change in our region by fostering healthy communities. Given the fractured history of St Louis and its segregation, PECaD has worked with numerous community organizations and provider groups to build trust and has harnessed resources from non federal sources and NCI. We now propose to further strengthen partnerships in the St. Louis region and extend our activities to additional areas chosen based on poverty levels; limited access to cancer screening and prevention services; excess cancer incidence or mortality; and expressed community Interest In collaborative efforts to address cancer health disparities. Our three communities are St Louis City and North County, MO; St. Clair County, IL, and southeastern Missouri. The Specific aims are: 1. In collaboration with our community partners, using the community outreach program and working with our community partnerships, we will extend and evaluate the effectiveness of outreach. 2. In a research project created in partnership with our colorectal cancer community partnership, we will design and conduct a RCT of community awareness plus systems level changes to reinforce provider behavior change to order and follow-up on colorectal cancer screening tests. 3. In our pilot educational research project created with our prostate cancer community partnership, we will evaluate barriers and facilitators to participation in prostate CA tissue collection for research (biobanking). 4. Through our training program, provide CBPR training for researchers and community members collaborating with the program and institute an ongoing process for Identifying and vetting future pilot projects. 5. In conjunction with our community Disparities Elimination Advisory Committee (DEAC), we will develop a framework for evaluation within and across our Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs.          Excess cancer mortality In low income, minority and underserved populations will be addressed through community based participatory research projects that bring prevention information and access to 3 high risk populations. In addition a research project addressing disparities in access to colorectal cancer screening will be Implemented and evaluated along with education and training program s to Increase expertise among junior investigators addressing cancer health disparities.",Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECAD),8540838,U54CA153460,"['Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' diagnosis service ', ' Diagnostic Services ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' bone fracture ', ' Fracture ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Libraries ', ' Missouri ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Testing ', ' Tissue/Specimen Collection ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' catalyst ', ' Jewish ', ' follower of religion Jewish ', ' base ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Church ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' cancer care ', ' outreach to information ', ' Access to Information ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Diagnostics ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Collection ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U54,2013,1055946,0.020359993803235225
"Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC)    DESCRIPTION: In response to RFA CA-09-032, the Center for Asian Health of Temple University proposes to establish a regional Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) to address the cancer burden and co-morbidities among underserved Asian American populations through community outreach, research, and training. The proposed Center builds upon the successful collaborations that were fostered during the previous ATECAR SPN and ATECAR CNP-I cycles and consists of academic institutions, community organizations, and community healthcare providers. The ACCHDC will work towards the overall goal of reducing cancer health disparities by increasing knowledge of, access to and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures in underserved Asian American communities. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to guide all Center activities, which fall within four components: the Administrative Core (AC), Community Outreach Program (COP), Research Program (RP) and Training Program (TP). The AC will provide essential administrative, scientific, programmatic, and community leadership and timely coordination of Center operations. The COP will focus on building cancer control capacity and increasing knowledge and access to cancer prevention among the multi-ethnic and multilingual Asian communities in the eastern region of the US (PA, NJ and NYC). Under the RP, a large-scale controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBPR colorectal cancer (CRC) intervention in increasing screening, knowledge of, perceived risks of and susceptibility to CRC and benefits of screening, as well as reducing health system barriers to screening. The pilot study, led by a junior investigator, will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate education intervention in increasing knowledge of and intent to participate in Hepatitis B biospecimen research and examining cultural factors associated with the participation in biospecimen research.

"Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP) University of Washington (UW) and Black Hills Center for American Indian Health (BHCAIH) seek support for Native People for Cancer Control (NPCC), a currently-funded regional Community Networks Program (CNP). NPCC is organized into an Administrative Core and Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs. Directorship of NPCC will be shared by Dedra Buchwald, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director, Partnerships for Native Health, UW; and Jeffrey Henderson (Cheyenne River Sioux), MD, MPH, President and CEO of the community-based, non-profit BHCAIH in Rapid City, SD. NPCC serves an 8-state region and is headquartered at UW in Seattle, with 3 additional sites that align geographically with the conduct of our Community Outreach Program activities. Site 1 includes Washington, Alaska, and Oregon; Site 2 includes Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming; and Site 3 includes North and South Dakota. NPCC will include 15 American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) investigators, staff, and partners. AI/ANs have the poorest 5-year survival from all cancers combined among all U.S. racial/ethnic groups,(12) and access to cancer clinical trials is difficult. Our overarching aim, therefore, is to directly contribute to improved cancer health outcomes and quality of life for AI/AN populations, which experience dramatic health inequities. Our central strategy is to capitalize on opportunities and leverage existing resources to pursue an integrated, multifaceted research program that is catalyzed by tight partnerships with Native communities. We will address cancer health issues ranging from prevention and clinical trials to survivorship. Our long-term goal is to generate findings that can be translated into practices and policies that will reduce AI/AN cancer-related health disparities. Thus, our Specific Aims are to: 1) increase cancer education, outreach, health promotion, and prevention efforts among urban and rural AI/ANs through the activities of the Community Outreach Program; 2) conduct 1 Research Project, 2 CNP Pilot Projects, and 2 Training Projects using community-based participatory methods that focus on colorectal cancer screening, health literacy and communication, cancer risk factors and care, and clinical trials education among Al/ANs; 3) train at least 5 AI/AN junior faculty members to conduct research through the efforts of the Training Program; and 4) reduce cancer health disparities by increasing access to, and use of, interventions among AI/AN populations through all NPCC activities. These activities will be coordinated by the Administrative Core. With a wide network of partners, 25 funded cancer-related grants and 54 publications by NPCC-affiliated investigators, NPPC has the essential elements of a successful CNP, both as an individual site and as a member of the CNP network. Healthy People 2010 focuses on health disparities, yet progress reports revealed minimal improvement for Al/ANs in areas previously identified as problematic. For example, only 62% of AI/ANs had health insurance, virtually unchanged over the previous 4 years, and life expectancy for AI/ANs was up to 8 years shorter than for non-Al/ANs. Cancer morbidity, mortality, risk prevalence, and barriers to care remain major problems in Native communities. Concerted, coordinated, multidisciplinary efforts are needed to redress the striking cancer-related disparities experienced by this vulnerable population.",Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP),8541728,U54CA153498,"['Alaska ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Idaho ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Montana ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' North Dakota ', ' Oregon ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' South Dakota ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Wyoming ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Native Americans ', ' Community Networks ', ' Rivers ', ' programs ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' member ', ' sioux community ', ' Sioux ', ' Sioux Indians ', ' Prevention ', ' outreach program ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer education ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Health Communication ', ' Research Training ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Outreach Research ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U54,2013,572536,0.023863481788328166
"Identifying Disparities in Type 2 Diabetes Among Asian Americans: The Pan Asian C    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the Asian American population has grown dramatically in size and diversity in recent decades, there are wide gaps in our knowledge of health and healthcare for this population. Asian subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) are often aggregated in clinical and population-based studies because of small numbers in any one subgroup. In particular, data are lacking on Type 2 diabetes and obesity for Asian Americans, suggested to have increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. Moreover, no data explains whether this applies equally for all Asian American subgroups. The prevalence of obesity, pre-diabetes, diabetes and the diabetic complications of diabetes are largely unknown in specific Asian subgroups. There is also a controversy about how obesity should be defined for Asians. In 2004, the World Health Organization recommended lower body mass index (BMI) cut points to define overweight and obesity for people of Asian descent worldwide. However the evidence on which this is based is debatable, and it is possible that this association will be different in Asian subgroups living in the U.S. It is also unknown if risk factors for diabetes are similarly predictive for Asian American subgroups and Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Better information is needed concerning screening, incidence, prevalence, risk factors, natural history of obesity and diabetes, and healthcare and patient factors that affect treatment disparities for Asian American subgroups. This application aims to examine diabetes screening, risk and care both to fill gaps in knowledge of diabetes disparities and to inform clinical decision making regarding screening and healthcare for Asian Americans. We propose to construct a mixed historical and prospective longitudinal cohort by linking existing clinical databases in a large (20,000), multiethnic sample of contemporary Asians in California. We will define Asian subgroups through self-report, and will include a sample of NHWs for comparison. Use of electronic health records in this epidemiologic study will allow highly cost efficient assembly and follow-up of this cohort. The overall goal of this application is to address a substantial gap in existing knowledge regarding diabetes risk in Asian racial/ethnic minorities. This study will provide a greater understanding of diabetes among Asian ethnic minorities in a comparable environment, and would contribute both to a global understanding of risk for Asian populations and to more targeted research, public health and clinical efforts throughout the U.S.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Limited information is available about diabetes among Asians, one of the nation's fastest growing minority groups. The overall goal of this application is to address a substantial gap in existing knowledge about diabetes in Asians. This application will provide a greater understanding of diabetes among Asian racial/ethnic minorities and would contribute to targeted research, public health, and clinical efforts throughout the U.S.         ",Identifying Disparities in Type 2 Diabetes Among Asian Americans: The Pan Asian C,8400426,R01DK081371,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Asian Americans ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications of diabetes ', ' microvascular complications ', ' Diabetic Vascular Disorder ', ' Diabetic Vascular Diseases ', ' Diabetic Vascular Complications ', ' Diabetic Angiopathies ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Language ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Preferred Provider Organizations ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' World Health Organization ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' diabetic ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Immigrant ', ' Attenuated ', ' Koreans ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' syndrome x ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' cohort ', ' care seeking ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Sampling ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Hindu ', ' Asian Indian ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' macrovascular complication ', ' macrovascular disease ', ' comparison group ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' obesity risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDDK,PALO ALTO MEDICAL FOUNDATION RES INST,R01,2013,420259,0.06815020269769384
"Minnesota Community Networks Center For Eliminating Cancer Disparaties DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this application is to establish a Regional Community Networks Program known as the Minnesota Community Networks Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities among racial/ethnic minority populations in Minnesota with an initial focus on Minnesota's growing new immigrant and refugee populations using Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach. While Minnesota is often perceived to have few minorities, the state's racial/ethnic distribution has changed substantially. Between 1990 and 2008, African Americans in Minnesota grew from 94,944 to 225,648 (138% growth) Latinos grew from 53,884 to 200,736 (273% growth), Asians grew from 77,886 to 180,835 (132% growth), compared to whites who grew from 4,130,395 to 4,559,336 (10% growth). During the same period, the population of foreign-born individuals in Minnesota increased from 260,000 to 340,000. The proposed Center will build on existing statewide cancer prevention and control infrastructure known as Minnesota Cancer Alliance, and on established successful university-community partnerships. In addition to the CNP headquarters at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, the Center will have sites in Willmar (West Central) and Owatonna (Southern), both rural communities in Minnesota. The proposed CNP center will comprise of four cores: Administrative Core, Community Outreach Core, Research Core, and Training Core. The Administrative Core will provide overall leadership and organizational infrastructure for the Center; the Community Outreach Core will collaborate with established partners. New American Community Services (African immigrants) and Centro Campesino (Latino immigrants) increasing community members' awareness of, knowledge about, and access to cervical and breast cancer screening; the Research Core will support one full project (tobacco use) and one pilot research project (cervical cancer screening); the Training Core will prepare a cadre of scientists and health professionals with focus on underrepresented groups across Minnesota to incorporate CBPR into their cancer research and promote their capacity to achieve sustained career success as community-engaged health disparity researchers.

"Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC)    DESCRIPTION: In response to RFA CA-09-032, the Center for Asian Health of Temple University proposes to establish a regional Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) to address the cancer burden and co-morbidities among underserved Asian American populations through community outreach, research, and training. The proposed Center builds upon the successful collaborations that were fostered during the previous ATECAR SPN and ATECAR CNP-I cycles and consists of academic institutions, community organizations, and community healthcare providers. The ACCHDC will work towards the overall goal of reducing cancer health disparities by increasing knowledge of, access to and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures in underserved Asian American communities. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to guide all Center activities, which fall within four components: the Administrative Core (AC), Community Outreach Program (COP), Research Program (RP) and Training Program (TP). The AC will provide essential administrative, scientific, programmatic, and community leadership and timely coordination of Center operations. The COP will focus on building cancer control capacity and increasing knowledge and access to cancer prevention among the multi-ethnic and multilingual Asian communities in the eastern region of the US (PA, NJ and NYC). Under the RP, a large-scale controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBPR colorectal cancer (CRC) intervention in increasing screening, knowledge of, perceived risks of and susceptibility to CRC and benefits of screening, as well as reducing health system barriers to screening. The pilot study, led by a junior investigator, will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate education intervention in increasing knowledge of and intent to participate in Hepatitis B biospecimen research and examining cultural factors associated with the participation in biospecimen research. The TP will develop and implement a comprehensive research training program in CBPR methods and provide mentorship and key resources to junior researchers from racial/ethnic minority and underrepresented groups.

"Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is now the leading cause of death in the state of North Carolina. In 2006, over 17,000 North Carolinians died from cancer. African Americans carry a disproportionate burden of cancer disease, with higher mortality rates than Caucasians from prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer. The Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) will leverage the myriad successes of CCN I and continue to promote the community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in adhering to the established mission of reducing cancer health disparities among adult African Americans in North Carolina. CCN II will be based at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will provide a three-pronged research infrastructure that includes: Outreach, Research, and Training. CCN II will continue to work with faith-based and secular community groups in two regional areas in North Carolina that comprise 13 urban and rural counties. CCN II program activities will be undertaken through the coordinating efforts of the Administrative Core, the partnership strengthening activities of the Community Outreach Program and the junior faculty development activities of the Training Program to form a comprehensive, interactive, community-academic research center.   Specifically, 1) the Administrative core will provide scientific leadership and direction to all three of CCN M's programs, cultivating cohesion and synergy to meet Center goals; 2) the Community Outreach Program will provide needs assessments, culturally sensitive cancer education, and targeted health promotion and dissemination efforts in concert with existing Community Partners; 3) the Training Program will identify, instruct and support the development of early-stage investigators interested in developing their own health disparities research programs using the CBPR approach; and 4) the Research Program will support the conduct of an evidence-based intervention study to increase colorectal cancer screening rates among African Americans using data generated from CCN I preliminary research and existing partnerships.          Racial/ethnic minorities carry a greater burden of cancer than other population groups. Although there are many beneficial biomedical and behavioral services available for cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, many health disparities continue because these benefits are not shared by all. The CCN II will address cancer disparities among African Americans by working with community members to increase knowledge, access and use of services in North Carolina.",Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II),8714262,U54CA153602,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Budgets ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Cause of Death ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' North Carolina ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Community Networks ', ' Staging ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' cancer education ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Outreach Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' Network-based ', ' community based participatory research ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U54,2013,142561,0.053281791724256934

"Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Intiative (1 of 2)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal entitled the Chicago Southside Cancer Disparities Initiative (CSCDI) seeks support to form a partnership between the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC), a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and Chicago State University (CSU), a minority serving institution, to develop an infrastructure for cancer education, training and outreach. Abiding to the call for action to increase underrepresented minorities in the health care workforce as a mechanism to reduce disparities and advance research pertinent to the community, it is critical that we develop educational and academic pathways to increase knowledge transfer at the undergraduate and graduate levels. To this end, the CSCDI's objectives are to: 1) Create an Inter-University collaboration to develop, implement and evaluate cancer disparities curriculum to be integrated within selected CSU's current MPH curriculum as well as UC's Pritzker School of Medicine's (PSOM) curriculum. 2) Provide opportunities for community involvement through collaboratively developing and enhancing existing service learning sites(i.e. community organization) at both institutions; 3) Train MPH cohorts to engage service learning sites(i.e. community organization) in cancer prevention, health promotion and dissemination of cancer research; and 4) Expand education and training beyond the 4-year grant period by utilizing an NCI mechanism Cancer Education Program (R25E) or other federal agency collaborative research training grant There is a pressing need to improve cancer outcomes in Chicago. Specifically, UCCCC has been a leading institution for groundbreaking cancer research and technological advances. However, impact at the community level has been challenging and research dissemination into communities has been weak. CSU, an urban public University has had a long history of education, leadership and commitment to the Chicago's Southside. CSU has recently developed a new Master of Public Health (MPH) program to focus on minority health and health equity, providing an exciting opportunity for our partnership. However, despite CSU's strengths and reach, their research program and expertise in cancer disparities are tenuous, while cancer disparities on Chicago's Southside are on the rise. CSCDI, therefore, is an innovative and timely partnership that will bridge outstanding minority students and faculty together with nationally recognized educators and researchers in the field of cancer to increase the pool of minority public health professionals interested in studying cancer disparities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer disparities among minority communities continue to grow. It is time to affect change by diversifying the health professional work force, a critical stp to the continued progress of cancer research, knowledge transfer and the understanding of cancer disparities among marginalized groups.

"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network -- II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network N's overarching goal is to contribute materially to: understanding the underlying causes of cancer-related health disparities; discovering and developing effective innovations to lower incidence, improving survival, and reducing suffering; delivering these innovations to high-risk populations and moving them to widespread dissemination. We focus on African Americans (AAs) in South Carolina, a group in a region with much higher-than-average cancer incidence and extraordinarily high mortality given incidence. Our goal will be realized by achieving these Specific Aims: 1. to increase the knowledge base needed to understand which biomedical and behavioral procedures are most likely to prevent and control cancer in the high-risk African-American communities in South Carolina; 2. to develop and test interventions that are likely to reduce cancer incidence, downstage disease at time of diagnosis, increase longevity, and improve quality of life in people with cancer; 3. To deliver interventions shown to be effective to places of greatest receptivity and public health need and to evaluate them in terms of generalizability (i.e., external validity); and 4. To disseminate results from successful interventions in the form of intervention ""packages"" within our communities in South Carolina and to work with national partners to determine and distinguish universal elements that will work most (or at least many) places and others that are more place- and culture-specific. The success of SCCDCN-ll is predicated on: strong community support; dedication to the principles of community-based participatory research; understanding that the philosophical underpinnings and practical methods of applying knowledge are essentially the same across interdisciplinary, translational and community-based participatory research; that the tripartite missions of research, education, and service are both inseparable and highly interdependent; and that training of the next generation of scientists dedicated to the highest ideals of community-based participatory, interdisciplinary, and translational research is necessary in order to reduce, and then finally eliminate cancer-related health disparities.              The SCCDCN-ll builds on work begun in CNP-I that allows us to expand programming to reduce, and finally eliminate entirely, cancer-related health disparities.

We aim to foster community-engaged, social science cancer disparities research, build a platform for public health-related curriculum modification, and create a pipeline of well-trained and experienced cancer researchers and students who choose health and science-related careers. NEIU has evolved into a comprehensive university with a track record of training highly qualified bachelor's and master's-level students for professional careers in the social sciences, education, and science fields. Complementary to NEIU strengths, RHLCCC-NU conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research with an excess of $158 million in annual extramural funding and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  This synergy will facilitate accomplishment of the following objectives: 1) to expose NEIU faculty and students to research conducted at RHLCCC-NU in the areas of medical social sciences, community engagement and health disparities; 2) to enhance RHLCCC-NU and NEIUs collaborative research efforts and networking opportunities through increased participation in conferences and symposia; 3) to introduce cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research principles through workshops, seminars, lectures, community/university outreach, and academic instruction; 4) to incorporate team-based research projects that will generate a steady pipeline of students to continue advanced studies; 5) to incorporate innovative experience-learning curricular modifications to expose students to cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research; and 6) to develop scientists who will succeed in securing funding that addresses cancer disparities. We propose a three-pronged approach to achieve these objectives.  First, in the initial planning phase, we will establish our administrative leadership and a community steering committee (CSC) focused on integrating scientific research training, education modification, and community engagement throughout the 4 years of this effort. Second, administrative leadership and the CSC will work to set priorities. Finally, during the implementation stage, we will conduct a series of NEIU-NU pilot research and education projects meant to develop into competitive and collaborative research and training grants and a larger U54 MSI-CCC Partnership Grant. Collectively, these efforts will engage the diverse faculty and student populations at NEIU and NU into a cohesive network of cancer-related social sciences research and education aimed at reducing cancer health disparities. RELEVANCE: The presence of major cancer health disparities in Chicago is well-documented, and this proposed partnership poses a unique approach to reduce deeply-engrained disparities. NU NEIGHBORS is a partnership in research and education; we aim to foster and enhance efforts to build a pipeline of students entering health-related careers, increase the number of cancer health disparities researchers and facilitate translation of cancer research to Chicago land communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",NU:  NEIGHBORS:  A Social Science Partnership to Reduce Cancer Disparities (2 of*,8546197,P20CA165592,"['Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Graduate Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Illinois ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mentorship ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Students ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' skills training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' science education ', ' success ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' outreach ', ' technological innovation ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' R25 Program ', ' R25 Mechanism ', ' Education Projects ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Qualifying ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' social science research ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,P20,2013,374397,0.014875794614402355
"Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Intiative (1 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal entitled the Chicago Southside Cancer Disparities Initiative (CSCDI) seeks support to form a partnership between the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC), a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and Chicago State University (CSU), a minority serving institution, to develop an infrastructure for cancer education, training and outreach. Abiding to the call for action to increase underrepresented minorities in the health care workforce as a mechanism to reduce disparities and advance research pertinent to the community, it is critical that we develop educational and academic pathways to increase knowledge transfer at the undergraduate and graduate levels. To this end, the CSCDI's objectives are to: 1) Create an Inter-University collaboration to develop, implement and evaluate cancer disparities curriculum to be integrated within selected CSU's current MPH curriculum as well as UC's Pritzker School of Medicine's (PSOM) curriculum. 2) Provide opportunities for community involvement through collaboratively developing and enhancing existing service learning sites(i.e. community organization) at both institutions; 3) Train MPH cohorts to engage service learning sites(i.e. community organization) in cancer prevention, health promotion and dissemination of cancer research; and 4) Expand education and training beyond the 4-year grant period by utilizing an NCI mechanism Cancer Education Program (R25E) or other federal agency collaborative research training grant There is a pressing need to improve cancer outcomes in Chicago. Specifically, UCCCC has been a leading institution for groundbreaking cancer research and technological advances. However, impact at the community level has been challenging and research dissemination into communities has been weak. CSU, an urban public University has had a long history of education, leadership and commitment to the Chicago's Southside. CSU has recently developed a new Master of Public Health (MPH) program to focus on minority health and health equity, providing an exciting opportunity for our partnership. However, despite CSU's strengths and reach, their research program and expertise in cancer disparities are tenuous, while cancer disparities on Chicago's Southside are on the rise. CSCDI, therefore, is an innovative and timely partnership that will bridge outstanding minority students and faculty together with nationally recognized educators and researchers in the field of cancer to increase the pool of minority public health professionals interested in studying cancer disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer disparities among minority communities continue to grow. It is time to affect change by diversifying the health professional work force, a critical stp to the continued progress of cancer research, knowledge transfer and the understanding of cancer disparities among marginalized groups.  By providing education to a diverse public health workforce, we will improve dissemination, strengthen our reach and collaborate to affect change.",Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Intiative (1 of 2),8704603,P20CA165582,"['Affect ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mission ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' cohort ', ' cancer education ', ' Institution ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' M.P.H.

"Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Regional CNP located in Alameda County, California the home to one and a half million people and the most diverse county in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has large populations of Asian American (25%), Hispanic Americans (22%), African Americans (17%), and a decreasing Euro-American population (37%), and is the home of the largest group of Afghan refugees in the US. This county not only has diversity in its ethnic/racial composition but also a large population of persons who are uninsured or underinsured and of limited English proficiency. This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement.          At a time of reduced resources, low income populations who are uninsured and of limited English proficiency bear a disproportionate share of the burden of cancer. This CNP will provide the opportunity to increase collaboration between communities of color, academic institutions and health serving organizations to make more efficient use of existing resources.",Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities,8719506,U54CA153506,"['Asian Americans ', ' Awareness ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Breast ', '

"Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECAD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECaD) at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center, St Louis, MO of Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital was established in 2003 with institutional funds in response to known excess cancer burden within the region particularly for minority and medically underserved populations. The Goals are to create a national model for eliminating disparities In cancer through community-based partnerships and community based participatory research (CBPR); to increase access by breaking down barriers to quality cancer care; and to be a catalyst for change in our region by fostering healthy communities. Given the fractured history of St Louis and its segregation, PECaD has worked with numerous community organizations and provider groups to build trust and has harnessed resources from non federal sources and NCI. We now propose to further strengthen partnerships in the St. Louis region and extend our activities to additional areas chosen based on poverty levels; limited access to cancer screening and prevention services; excess cancer incidence or mortality; and expressed community Interest In collaborative efforts to address cancer health disparities. Our three communities are St Louis City and North County, MO; St. Clair County, IL, and southeastern Missouri. The Specific aims are: 1. In collaboration with our community partners, using the community outreach program and working with our community partnerships, we will extend and evaluate the effectiveness of outreach. 2. In a research project created in partnership with our colorectal cancer community partnership, we will design and conduct a RCT of community awareness plus systems level changes to reinforce provider behavior change to order and follow-up on colorectal cancer screening tests. 3. In our pilot educational research project created with our prostate cancer community partnership, we will evaluate barriers and facilitators to participation in prostate CA tissue collection for research (biobanking). 4. Through our training program, provide CBPR training for researchers and community members collaborating with the program and institute an ongoing process for Identifying and vetting future pilot projects. 5.

"Southeast Michigan Community Network Program    DESCRIPTION: This application, in response to RFA-CA-09-032, Community Networks Program (U54), proposes to continue our vibrant, comprehensive, and sustainable program to reduce disparities in breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in southeast Michigan. Under CNP I, we have mobilized with extraordinary community partners to implement an integrated system of community-based participatory education, training, and research activities. Our regional CNP II Center will include four large urban areas severely impacted by economic hardship: Detroit, Inkster, Southfield, and Pontiac. This tri-county area accounts for 71.3% of Michigan's African American population and 42% of the state's below poverty population. In SE Michigan, older African Americans have higher rates of poverty and comorbid medical diseases related to being underserved medically (5, 6). Our team of collaborating investigators and community partners will continue to build on our established partnerships. The effort will be led by the Karmanos Cancer Institute, the School of Medicine at Wayne State University, and the Josephine Ford Cancer Center of the Henry Ford Health System. Support for our CNP I and now CNP II is broadly based, demonstrated by the community leaders, researchers, clinicians and public officials with whom we have strong relationships and who have joined our Center Steering Committee and Community Advisory Group, and have written letters of support included in this application. We propose a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach to address three aims for reducing disparities: Aim 1. To continue to increase knowledge, access and use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures to reduce disparities related to breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer, among older, underserved African American adults in southeast Michigan; Aim 2. To continue to develop and implement evidence-based intervention research to increase use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures for cancer prevention, detection and treatment of older African Americans; and Aim 3. To recruit and train a critical mass of promising and successful new researchers in CBPR to reduce cancer health disparities.          RELEVANCE (See Instructions):  Older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of cancers, are first diagnosed at advanced stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates.

"Lay Health Worker Model to Reduce Liver Cancer Disparities in Asian Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is globally most common and serious viral infection of the liver. It can cause premature death from liver diseases or liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection and liver cancer caused by HBV among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) is one of the most serious - but frequently neglected-health disparity issues in the U.S. AAPIs account for over half of the 1.3 million chronic hepatitis B cases and deaths from HBV infection. This excess risk can be attributed to high rates of HBV infection (particularly among first-generation immigrants) in combination with low rates of HBV screening and vaccination due to cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers. HBV infection affect Asian Americans disproportionately, and thus it leads to a huge liver cancer disparity among Asian Americans compared to other racial/ethnic groups.  In response to these cancer disparities, the objective of this project is to build a sustainable, community-based, participator program of lay health workers (LHWs) who can promote liver cancer prevention programs among high-risk groups of Asian Americans. This proposed study attempts to implement culturally integrated liver cancer prevention programs for Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americans through outreach, screening, education, research, and training in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The specific aims are: (1) To develop a training protocol and certificate program for LHWs; (2) To assess the prevalence of HBV infection; (3) To implement intervention programs, based on screening test results; and (4) To evaluate the effectiveness of LHW intervention on adherence to HBV vaccinations among those unprotected.  A total of 600 Asian American adults (200 Chinese, Koreans, and Vietnamese in each group), 18 years of age and older will be recruited from the community. Trained and certified LHWs will recruit participants at community-based organizations and hep B free screening events. All the eligible participants will complete a self-administered questionnaire and receive liver cancer education. Then, they will receive hepatitis B test. Every participant will receive the results of screening tests by mail or phone. We will provide referral services for treatment to those infected. For those unprotected, we will implement intervention programs to increase a series of vaccinations within 6 months using a randomized controlled design. Seven months after mailing the results, we will conduct telephone interviews among those unprotected. Upon completing follow-up, those in the control will receive the delayed LHW intervention. The insights gained from this proposed LHW intervention will be valuable in implementing liver cancer prevention programs for other high-risk non-English speaking populations and will address health disparities among immigrant populations.          We will develop and build a sustainable, community-based participatory program to promote live cancer prevention programs for Asian Americans through outreach, education, screening, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of chronic HBV infection in the Baltimore Washington Metropolitan Area.

"Community Networks Program: The Johns Hopkins Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under the direction of its community partners within Baltimore City and Prince George's County, the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center proposes to formally establish the ""Community Networks Program (CNP): The Johns Hopkins Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities."" The proposed Center arises from an established community-academic practice partnership that has been active across the two counties, in delivery of cancer screening services, and in research. These predominantly African American counties differ in socio economic status, but both experience disproportionate mortality due to breast, cervix and colorectal cancer. The objective of this proposal is to create an infrastructure to support community-driven research that creates training opportunities for early-stage investigators. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To establish an Administrative Core to provide leadership for the Center's overall strategic planning, including scientific leader-ship-and-oversight-on using-the-GBPR approach and its core-principles; 2) To develop a Community- Outreach Program that leverages existing community outreach initiatives targeted to multiethnic underserved populations in Baltimore City and Prince George's County; 3) To implement a Research Program consisting of two projects: a) the Full Research Project, ""Evaluating Coaches of Older Adults for Cancer Care and Healthy Behaviors (COACH)"", a randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of trained, participant designated coaches vs. professionally-based navigators, in supporting adherence to cancer screening; and b) the Pilot Educational Research Project, a mixed-methods study that examines knowledge, attitudes and willingness of multiethnic older adults to participate in a cancer-related biospecimen repository; 4) To establish a Training Program with the primary goal of increasing the number of qualified health disparity researchers experienced in using CBPR in the context of cancer disparities. The CNP Center at Johns Hopkins will create a sustainable infrastructure for community based participatory research on a large, multiple project, highly collaborative scale, It will increase knowledge of, access to, and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures related to cancer in areas ranging from prevention to early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.

"Enhancing Expertise of Community Partners to Promote Equity in CBPR     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has gained visibility and acceptance as an approach to engage minority communities in health disparities research. There have been an increasing number of conferences focused on CBPR, however typically they are tailored for academics. For community partners to participate as equal partners in CBPR with academic researchers there is a need to enhance their knowledge and skills and support systems among their peers at the national level. The Community-Based Public Health Caucus (CBPHC) of the American Public Health Association (APHA) was formed in 2000 by community and academic partners to promote CBPH in research, teaching, and practice. CBPR is an assets-based approach where communities, public health practitioners, and academicians work together to identify issues, mobilize resources, and implement solutions to improve health and promote health equity. CBPHC promotes the use of CBPR as a way to assure equitable relationships in community-academic partnering for research. CBPHC seeks support to maximize the resources and opportunities afforded by 2013 APHA Annual Meeting in Boston as a mechanism to address identified training and support needs of community partners in CBPR. This will include organizing 1) a full-day Learning Institute entitled, ""Enhancing Expertise of Community Partners to Promote Equity in CBPR"" conducted by experienced community and academic members of the CBPHC; 2) sessions and meetings; and 3) formal and informal mentorship opportunities preceding, during, and after the APHA Annual Meeting.  This plan builds on over eleven years of experience of CBPHC reaching out to and mentoring community partners, disseminating results, and building skills in CBPR. The overarching goal is to develop the knowledge and skills, as well as the peer relationships and support systems needed by community partners to reduce health disparities in their communities by participating as equal partners in CBPR. Our innovative approach is utilizing CBPHC and its connection with APHA to help achieve mutuality between community and academic partners enabling community members to be equal partners in CBPR. Our team will use CBPR principles (Israel et al, 1998) to guide the development and implementation of these activities. We will address the following aims through an iterative approach: 1) Through surveys and discussions with community members of the CBPHC and other research partnerships and national groups, develop a comprehensive understanding of priority training and support needs of community partners in CBPR; 2) Maximize the resources and opportunities afforded by APHA as a mechanism to address identified training and support needs; 3) Establish a peer mentoring/support program for community partners in CBPR and pilot modalities to build relationships and a network of support; and 4) Evaluate the effectiveness of training, peer mentoring, and support activities and identify ongoing and new training and support needs of participants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has gained visibility and acceptance as an approach to engage minority communities in health disparities research (Israel et al 1998) (Eng 2006) (Jurkowski & Paul-Ward, 2007) (Minkler and Wallerstein 2008) (Bonham et al 2009) (De Loney et al, 2009) (Israel et al, 2010) (Minkler et al, 2012). This proposal supporting conference and related activities of the Community-Based Public Health Caucus is relevant to the mission of NIMHD and public health in that it will promote minority health and the reduction of health disparities by developing the knowledge and skills, as well as the peer relationships and support systems needed by the community partners to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities in their communities by participating as equal partners in CBPR (Community-Campus Partnerships for Health 2007) (Key et al, 2010) (Hammat et al, 2011) (Community Campus Partnerships for Health 2012). This conference plan will maximize the resources and opportunities afforded by the American Public Health Association as a mechanism to address identified training and support needs for the primary audience for these activities: community partners from minority and other health disparity communities who are or wish to be engaged as partners in health disparities research (Cashman et al 2008) (Griffith et al, 2009).                ",Enhancing Expertise of Community Partners to Promote Equity in CBPR,8525011,R13MD008147,"['APHA ', ' American Public Health Association ', ' Boston ', ' Communities ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Solutions ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Training Support ', ' Work ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' ward ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' Minority ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NIMHD,COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION PARTNERS,R13,2013,43889,0.00016087649241583162
"NYU Center for the Study of Asian American Health The New York University (NYU) Center for the Study of Asian American Health (CSAAH) is a partnership of an academic medical and research center (NYU), several healthcare and public hospital organizations, and more than 55 community and government partners serving NYC's Asian American community. CSAAH's primary mission is to address, alleviate, and eliminate Asian American health disparities through a trans disciplinary and community-engaged research approach. To accomplish this mission, CSAAH is committed to the following guiding principles: 1) systemic change through the use of multiple strategies and working with diverse stakeholders; 2) equitable ""partnerships"" in research, training, and outreach; 3) action-oriented research; 4) strengthening research capacity of both community and academic partners to fully engage in the research process; and 5) conducting multicultural evaluation as a means to foster ownership, sustainability and impact. These guiding principles are integrated in each of CSAAH's four cores: 1)  Administrative, 2) Research, 3) Research Training and Education, and 4) Community Engagement and Outreach. The Specific Aims of the overall Center are to: a) develop and conduct research to understand, address, and eliminate health disparities in the Asian American community; b) build new and strengthen existing private and public partnerships in order to increase outreach, dissemination advocacy, and research capacity to address Asian American health disparities and social inequalities; and c) train a cadre of health and public health professionals on community-based approaches to conducting research, outreach, service delivery, and advocacy in the Asian American community. CSAAH has been organized into five research tracks: 1) Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes; 2) Tumorigenesis; 3) Mental Health; 4) Social and Cultural Determinants of Health; and 5) Pilot Project Research. There are two main research projects proposed for this application. The OASIS Project is focused on developing and implementing a culturally-appropriate faith-based intervention to reduce obesity and social stressors in South Asian communities. The second research project tests the efficacy of a pilot intervention to reduce the risk of lymphedema among Chinese breast cancer survivors and improve quality of life and health issues for these women. In addition, there are many community engagement, research training, education, dissemination, and community health and resource needs assessments planned during the grant period with local and national academic and community partners serving Asian Americans populations.  There are significant and pervasive disparities in health status and access to care for Asian Americans in the U.S. The goal of this project is to implement a community-engaged and multi-level approach to conducting research, dissemination, research training and educational strategies to reduce health disparities in Asian American populations.",NYU Center for the Study of Asian American Health,8504498,P60MD000538,"['Asian Americans ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Lymphedema ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mission ', ' New York ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Ownership ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Medical Research ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Advocacy ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Training and Education ', ' stressor ', ' social inequality ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' hospital organization ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Outreach Research ', ' South Asian ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' dissemination research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' service intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' faith-based intervention ', ' public-private partnership ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P60,2013,1269730,0.07904442432724074
"Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP) University of Washington (UW) and Black Hills Center for American Indian Health (BHCAIH) seek support for Native People for Cancer Control (NPCC), a currently-funded regional Community Networks Program (CNP). NPCC is organized into an Administrative Core and Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs. Directorship of NPCC will be shared by Dedra Buchwald, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director, Partnerships for Native Health, UW; and Jeffrey Henderson (Cheyenne River Sioux), MD, MPH, President and CEO of the community-based, non-profit BHCAIH in Rapid City, SD. NPCC serves an 8-state region and is headquartered at UW in Seattle, with 3 additional sites that align geographically with the conduct of our Community Outreach Program activities. Site 1 includes Washington, Alaska, and Oregon; Site 2 includes Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming; and Site 3 includes North and South Dakota. NPCC will include 15 American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) investigators, staff, and partners. AI/ANs have the poorest 5-year survival from all cancers combined among all U.S. racial/ethnic groups,(12) and access to cancer clinical trials is difficult. Our overarching aim, therefore, is to directly contribute to improved cancer health outcomes and quality of life for AI/AN populations, which experience dramatic health inequities. Our central strategy is to capitalize on opportunities and leverage existing resources to pursue an integrated, multifaceted research program that is catalyzed by tight partnerships with Native communities. We will address cancer health issues ranging from prevention and clinical trials to survivorship. Our long-term goal is to generate findings that can be translated into practices and policies that will reduce AI/AN cancer-related health disparities. Thus, our Specific Aims are to: 1) increase cancer education, outreach, health promotion, and prevention efforts among urban and rural AI/ANs through the activities of the Community Outreach Program; 2) conduct 1 Research Project, 2 CNP Pilot Projects, and 2 Training Projects using community-based participatory methods that focus on colorectal cancer screening, health literacy and communication, cancer risk factors and care, and clinical trials education among Al/ANs; 3) train at least 5 AI/AN junior faculty members to conduct research through the efforts of the Training Program; and 4) reduce cancer health disparities by increasing access to, and use of, interventions among AI/AN populations through all NPCC activities. These activities will be coordinated by the Administrative Core. With a wide network of partners, 25 funded cancer-related grants and 54 publications by NPCC-affiliated investigators, NPPC has the essential elements of a successful CNP, both as an individual site and as a member of the CNP network. Healthy People 2010 focuses on health disparities, yet progress reports revealed minimal improvement for Al/ANs in areas previously identified as problematic. For example, only 62% of AI/ANs had health insurance, virtually unchanged over the previous 4 years, and life expectancy for AI/ANs was up to 8 years shorter than for non-Al/ANs. Cancer morbidity, mortality, risk prevalence, and barriers to care remain major problems in Native communities. Concerted, coordinated, multidisciplinary efforts are needed to redress the striking cancer-related disparities experienced by this vulnerable population.",Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP),8724019,U54CA153498,"['Alaska ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Idaho ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Montana ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' North Dakota ', ' Oregon ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' South Dakota ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Wyoming ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Native Americans ', ' Community Networks ', ' Rivers ', ' programs ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' member ', ' sioux community ', ' Sioux ', ' Sioux Indians ', ' Prevention ', ' outreach program ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer education ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Health Communication ', ' Research Training ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Outreach Research ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U54,2013,118463,0.023863481788328166

"Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the United States. Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take part in cancer prevention and screening activities than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. The overall goal of this project is to work collaboratively with regional partners to reduce cancer disparities. It is the long-term goal of this proposed Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to reduce the cancer disparities experienced by Hispanics in the two regions selected for this project. Our short-term objectives are to:   1. Develop and enhance our existing relationships with community partners in Regions 1 and 2 to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos and members of the Yakama Nation (Administrative Core)   2. Increase health promotion outreach and cancer screening activities among Latinos and members of   the Yakama Nation (Outreach Core); 3. Increase cervical cancer screening among Latinas using a rigorous research project (Research Core); 4. Develop and assess the feasibility of a sustainable support system for cancer patients and survivors (research Core); and 5. Train junior investigators, especially underrepresented minorities, in grant writing and CBPR to reduce cancer disparities.    This proposed Community Networks Program (CNP) builds on our existing CNP (2005 - 2010). It proposes to add a randomized clinical trial to assess two different approaches to motivate cervical cancer screening. Further it adds a patient navigator approach to reduce time to follow-up of an abnormal pap test. The pilot project builds on existing community concerns. Through its outreach core, the proposed Center will spread information and support at the population level. The training core will help train a new generation of scientists in CBPR and scientific research. Through its four cores, the proposed Center will cover a myriad of cancer disparities and assist NCI in its endeavor to reduce such disparities.             Latinos are at high risk for specific types of cancer and have a higher mortality rate for other types of cancer.  In this project, we will increase cancer education and outreach to Latinos as well as conduct research to reduce their cancer disparities.

"Minnesota Community Networks Center For Eliminating Cancer Disparaties DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this application is to establish a Regional Community Networks Program known as the Minnesota Community Networks Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities among racial/ethnic minority populations in Minnesota with an initial focus on Minnesota's growing new immigrant and refugee populations using Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach. While Minnesota is often perceived to have few minorities, the state's racial/ethnic distribution has changed substantially. Between 1990 and 2008, African Americans in Minnesota grew from 94,944 to 225,648 (138% growth) Latinos grew from 53,884 to 200,736 (273% growth), Asians grew from 77,886 to 180,835 (132% growth), compared to whites who grew from 4,130,395 to 4,559,336 (10% growth). During the same period, the population of foreign-born individuals in Minnesota increased from 260,000 to 340,000. The proposed Center will build on existing statewide cancer prevention and control infrastructure known as Minnesota Cancer Alliance, and on established successful university-community partnerships. In addition to the CNP headquarters at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, the Center will have sites in Willmar (West Central) and Owatonna (Southern), both rural communities in Minnesota. The proposed CNP center will comprise of four cores: Administrative Core, Community Outreach Core, Research Core, and Training Core. The Administrative Core will provide overall leadership and organizational infrastructure for the Center; the Community Outreach Core will collaborate with established partners.

"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network -- II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network N's overarching goal is to contribute materially to: understanding the underlying causes of cancer-related health disparities; discovering and developing effective innovations to lower incidence, improving survival, and reducing suffering; delivering these innovations to high-risk populations and moving them to widespread dissemination. We focus on African Americans (AAs) in South Carolina, a group in a region with much higher-than-average cancer incidence and extraordinarily high mortality given incidence. Our goal will be realized by achieving these Specific Aims: 1. to increase the knowledge base needed to understand which biomedical and behavioral procedures are most likely to prevent and control cancer in the high-risk African-American communities in South Carolina; 2. to develop and test interventions that are likely to reduce cancer incidence, downstage disease at time of diagnosis, increase longevity, and improve quality of life in people with cancer; 3. To deliver interventions shown to be effective to places of greatest receptivity and public health need and to evaluate them in terms of generalizability (i.e., external validity); and 4. To disseminate results from successful interventions in the form of intervention ""packages"" within our communities in South Carolina and to work with national partners to determine and distinguish universal elements that will work most (or at least many) places and others that are more place- and culture-specific. The success of SCCDCN-ll is predicated on: strong community support; dedication to the principles of community-based participatory research; understanding that the philosophical underpinnings and practical methods of applying knowledge are essentially the same across interdisciplinary, translational and community-based participatory research; that the tripartite missions of research, education, and service are both inseparable and highly interdependent; and that training of the next generation of scientists dedicated to the highest ideals of community-based participatory, interdisciplinary, and translational research is necessary in order to reduce, and then finally eliminate cancer-related health disparities.              The SCCDCN-ll builds on work begun in CNP-I that allows us to expand programming to reduce, and finally eliminate entirely, cancer-related health disparities.

"INTER-CAMBIO: Community-Academic Meetings to Bridge Initiatives in Obesity     DESCRIPTION: Obesity has been described as a national epidemic and is associated with a number of negative health outcomes, including higher rates of chronic disease (e.g., heart disease, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers), elevated health-care costs, decreased quality of life, and greater risk of premature death. Hispanics are disproportionally affected by obesity, having a 21% greater risk of being obese compared to non-Hispanic whites. One way to address obesity-related health disparities is through the creation of meaningful partnerships between academic institutions and community-based health organizations using an approach called community based participatory research (CBPR). OBJECTIVE: To establish a CBPR partnership between Northwestern University (NU) clinicians and researchers and the Chicago Hispanic Health Coalition (CHHC), a group of over 600 local health and social service agencies and community based organizations whose mission is to promote healthy behavior and prevent chronic disease and health disparities in the Hispanic communities of metropolitan Chicago. This partnership will jointly address racial health disparities among the Hispanic community as it relates to chronic stress and related cultural and environmental factors in the context of increasing engagement in obesity prevention and health promotion behaviors. STUDY DESIGN: We will form a collaborative research alliance, participate in capacity building, learning and professional development, and engage the Hispanic community through outreach and education. In Year 1, we will develop an advisory board, convene a community kickoff meeting, form a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between NU and CHHC, and host community forums for dissemination and outreach. In year 2 we will continue to have quarterly advisory board meetings and community forums. We will also develop an MOU with a second community based organization, Salud Latina. In year 3 we will continue quarterly advisory board meetings and community forums. We will also write and submit a grant proposal to build capacity within our developing alliance, enhance networks and infrastructure that will promote community-engaged research that not only takes place in the community, but involves the community; and foster preliminary work in health promotion and obesity prevention in the Hispanic community. RELEVANCE: This work will advance understanding and community-academic aligned strategies and action plans to prevent and reduce obesity among the Hispanic community through better understanding the role of chronic stress.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is a growing health problem in the United States, especially among the Hispanic community.   Academic-community partnerships based in community based participatory research (CBPR) are a useful way to generate novel ideas and solutions that possess scientific merit as well as community insight and acceptance.

"Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is now the leading cause of death in the state of North Carolina. In 2006, over 17,000 North Carolinians died from cancer. African Americans carry a disproportionate burden of cancer disease, with higher mortality rates than Caucasians from prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer. The Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) will leverage the myriad successes of CCN I and continue to promote the community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in adhering to the established mission of reducing cancer health disparities among adult African Americans in North Carolina. CCN II will be based at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will provide a three-pronged research infrastructure that includes: Outreach, Research, and Training. CCN II will continue to work with faith-based and secular community groups in two regional areas in North Carolina that comprise 13 urban and rural counties. CCN II program activities will be undertaken through the coordinating efforts of the Administrative Core, the partnership strengthening activities of the Community Outreach Program and the junior faculty development activities of the Training Program to form a comprehensive, interactive, community-academic research center.   Specifically, 1) the Administrative core will provide scientific leadership and direction to all three of CCN M's programs, cultivating cohesion and synergy to meet Center goals; 2) the Community Outreach Program will provide needs assessments, culturally sensitive cancer education, and targeted health promotion and dissemination efforts in concert with existing Community Partners; 3) the Training Program will identify, instruct and support the development of early-stage investigators interested in developing their own health disparities research programs using the CBPR approach; and 4) the Research Program will support the conduct of an evidence-based intervention study to increase colorectal cancer screening rates among African Americans using data generated from CCN I preliminary research and existing partnerships.          Racial/ethnic minorities carry a greater burden of cancer than other population groups. Although there are many beneficial biomedical and behavioral services available for cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, many health disparities continue because these benefits are not shared by all.

"Biologic Basis of Disparity in Liver Cancer Survival Among Asian Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a blatant example of a cancer health disparity in that HCC is disproportionally higher in incidence and mortality among Asian Americans compared with non-Hispanic Whites. Infection by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the principal risk factor for HCC among Asian Americans. HCC survival rates have significantly improved among those whose cancer is detected early and treated aggressively, but remain short among those with advanced, and rapidly progressive disease. Thus elucidating biological mechanisms underlying the behavior of HBV-mediated HCC will potentially contribute to improved surveillance, treatment, control and prevention. Our long term goal is to understand epidemiologic causes, sociocultural barriers, and biologic mechanisms of HBV-related disparities, and to develop tools which can decrease the burden of these diseases on the Asian American community. In this study, we will compare viral factors and immune responses in HBV-infected Laotian and Hmong, who experience the highest HCC mortality rates among Asians, with HBV-infected Chinese and Vietnamese, who experience better survival rates. Importantly, Laotian and Hmong are also diagnosed at a younger age but with more advanced disease compared to other Asian ethnicities suggesting that there is a biologic basis to this disparity in HCC survival. Our central hypothesis is that differences in viral variants and host immune responses exist within the Laotian/Hmong population, which in part cause an earlier onset and more aggressive form of HCC, resulting in a disparity in HCC survival. We propose using next generation sequencing technologies to 1) compare viral factors associated with HCC prognosis in HBV-infected Laotian/Hmong to HBV-infected Chinese and Vietnamese and 2) assess immune responses associated with HCC survival in these same groups by gene expression activity of pro-inflammatory responses including NF?B-related genes and anti-inflammatory responses such as regulatory T cells, as well as T cell receptor usage and HLA allele frequencies. The impact of this study will be to improve the understanding of the biologic basis of disparities in HCC survival among Asian American ethnicities and may lead to better risk stratification and tailoring of treatment of HCC based upon host and viral factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal builds upon our six---year history of NIH---funded research on liver cancer health disparities among Asian Americans through a focused study to delineate some of the biologic factors responsible for the poor survival among Laotian and Hmong, who experience the lowest survival rates for liver cancer among any Asian ethnicity. Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer---related death in the world, and hence the information gained from these studies may lead to better treatment strategies for liver cancer.

"CAUSES: Causes of Asian American mortality Understood by Socio-Economic Status  PROJECT SUMMARY Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States, with a population of over 14 million that is projected to reach nearly 34 million by 2050. However, our current understanding of Asian Americans is as an aggregated group, and very little is known about the six diverse Asian American racial/ethnic subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese), who have a wide range of disease risks, immigration histories, and socioeconomic status. There is currently a knowledge gap on the health of these expanding subpopulations, and there is no information to recommend research agendas, create public health policy, and offer clinical guidelines. Our current understanding of Asian American mortality patterns is distorted by the aggregation of distinct subgroups, the grouping of foreign-born and U.S.- born populations, and the unknown impact of sociodemographic factors. While the U.S. Census first started disaggregating Asian subgroups in 1980, disaggregation of Asian subgroups on U.S. death records occurred much later in 2003, and now over half of the 50 U.S. States disaggregate Asian subgroups. The goal of this study is to examine racial/ethnic, nativity, and geographic differences in Asian American subgroup mortality compared to other racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics). Investigation of cause-specific mortality in distinct subgroups, by nativity, and considering sociodemographic factors will be fundamental in assessing and addressing health disparities in Asian American communities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The current lack of national mortality statistics for Asian American subgroups makes it difficult to recommend research agendas, create public health policy, and offer clinical guidelines for diverse Asian American subgroups. The goal of this study is to examine racial/ethnic, nativity, and geographic disparities in Asian American subgroup mortality compared to other racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics).",CAUSES: Causes of Asian American mortality Understood by Socio-Economic Status,8449599,R01MD007012,"['Age ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death Records ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Heart ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Housing ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' County ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Attenuated ', ' Koreans ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' Coronary ', ' Hindu ', ' Asian Indian ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ']",NIMHD,PALO ALTO MEDICAL FOUNDATION RES INST,R01,2013,356455,0.07011385678788916
"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network -- II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network N's overarching goal is to contribute materially to: understanding the underlying causes of cancer-related health disparities; discovering and developing effective innovations to lower incidence, improving survival, and reducing suffering; delivering these innovations to high-risk populations and moving them to widespread dissemination. We focus on African Americans (AAs) in South Carolina, a group in a region with much higher-than-average cancer incidence and extraordinarily high mortality given incidence. Our goal will be realized by achieving these Specific Aims: 1. to increase the knowledge base needed to understand which biomedical and behavioral procedures are most likely to prevent and control cancer in the high-risk African-American communities in South Carolina; 2. to develop and test interventions that are likely to reduce cancer incidence, downstage disease at time of diagnosis, increase longevity, and improve quality of life in people with cancer; 3. To deliver interventions shown to be effective to places of greatest receptivity and public health need and to evaluate them in terms of generalizability (i.e., external validity); and 4. To disseminate results from successful interventions in the form of intervention ""packages"" within our communities in South Carolina and to work with national partners to determine and distinguish universal elements that will work most (or at least many) places and others that are more place- and culture-specific. The success of SCCDCN-ll is predicated on: strong community support; dedication to the principles of community-based participatory research; understanding that the philosophical underpinnings and practical methods of applying knowledge are essentially the same across interdisciplinary, translational and community-based participatory research; that the tripartite missions of research, education, and service are both inseparable and highly interdependent; and that training of the next generation of scientists dedicated to the highest ideals of community-based participatory, interdisciplinary, and translational research is necessary in order to reduce, and then finally eliminate cancer-related health disparities.              The SCCDCN-ll builds on work begun in CNP-I that allows us to expand programming to reduce, and finally eliminate entirely, cancer-related health disparities. A very favorable alignment of community and academic factors will provide many opportunities to increase the scientific evidence base in this arena and to use our many academic and community assets for junior faculty, and other professional and academic, training.",South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network -- II,8730838,U54CA153461,"['community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' successful intervention ', ' Academic Training ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Dedications ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Community Networks ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Behavioral ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,U54,2013,50084,0.0413213566868481
"Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Initiative ( 2 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal entitled the Chicago Southside Cancer Disparities Initiative (CSCDI) seeks support to form a partnership between the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC), a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and Chicago State University (CSU), a minority serving institution, to develop an infrastructure for cancer education, training and outreach. Abiding to the call for action to increase underrepresented minorities in the health care workforce as a mechanism to reduce disparities and advance research pertinent to the community, it is critical that we develop educational and academic pathways to increase knowledge transfer at the undergraduate and graduate levels. To this end, the CSCDI's objectives are to: 1) Create an Inter-University collaboration to develop, implement and evaluate cancer disparities curriculum to be integrated within selected CSU's current MPH curriculum as well as UC's Pritzker School of Medicine's (PSOM) curriculum. 2) Provide opportunities for community involvement through collaboratively developing and enhancing existing service learning sites(i.e. community organization) at both institutions; 3) Train MPH cohorts to engage service learning sites(i.e. community organization) in cancer prevention, health promotion and dissemination of cancer research; and 4) Expand education and training beyond the 4-year grant period by utilizing an NCI mechanism Cancer Education Program (R25E) or other federal agency collaborative research training grant There is a pressing need to improve cancer outcomes in Chicago. Specifically, UCCCC has been a leading institution for groundbreaking cancer research and technological advances. However, impact at the community level has been challenging and research dissemination into communities has been weak. CSU, an urban public University has had a long history of education, leadership and commitment to the Chicago's Southside. CSU has recently developed a new Master of Public Health (MPH) program to focus on minority health and health equity, providing an exciting opportunity for our partnership. However, despite CSU's strengths and reach, their research program and expertise in cancer disparities are tenuous, while cancer disparities on Chicago's Southside are on the rise. CSCDI, therefore, is an innovative and timely partnership that will bridge outstanding minority students and faculty together with nationally recognized educators and researchers in the field of cancer to increase the pool of minority public health professionals interested in studying cancer disparities.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer disparities among minority communities continue to grow.

"Reducing Asian Hepatitis B Disparities through Health Information Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major preventable health problem in the U.S. and the most pronounced health disparity disfavoring Asian Americans. Unfortunately, HBV patients, especially immigrants and minorities, often do not receive recommended levels of care, indicating a critical need for developing culturally appropriate and effective strategies that can be incorporated into existing clinical practice. The proposed project is a community-scientific collaboration between the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO) and its federally qualified health center member, International Community Health Services (ICHS) in Seattle, WA, as well as our scientific partner affiliated with the University of Washington and Virginia Mason Medical Center, and members of a community-based organization, the Hepatitis B Coalition of Washington. The project will assess the impact of culturally proficient Health Information Technology (HIT) strategies for underserved Asian Americans in Seattle, WA infected with HBV. Community-based participatory approaches will be utilized to conduct a needs assessment and develop a new culturally appropriate intervention to address HBV health disparities applicable across Asian American communities. Mixed methods, including key informant interviews, focus groups, and surveys, that incorporate community participation and perspectives from underserved HBV patients, family members, and providers, will be used to assess the impact of and needs for culturally proficient HIT strategies to improve HBV outcomes for underserved Asian Americans attending a community clinic in Seattle's International j District. The results from the needs assessment will be utilized to develop a pilot intervention incorporating HIT strategies for HBV care with participation and ownership from community-based health centers and their stakeholders. Quantitative methods will be used to test the effectiveness of the culturally proficient intervention in improving HBV vaccination, screening rates, and linkages to care. This project will serve as an important model for developing culturally proficient HBV care approaches integrating health services, HIT, and enabling services (or non-clinical support services) for underserved communities in the U.S.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project was started up by Asian hepatitis b doctors and patients at a clinic, because hepatitis b has become a big issue for Asian people. The clinic's patients, their families, and doctors will work with researchers and partners to find ways to improve hepatitis b care in the clinic and to help educate patients and their families.              ",Reducing Asian Hepatitis B Disparities through Health Information Technology,8500587,R24MD008095,"['Accounting ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Community Health Services ', ' Community Participation ', ' Community Services ', ' Data Collection ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Hepatitis ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Ownership ', ' Patients ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Social isolation ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' hepatitis virus infection ', ' Viral hepatitis ', ' Virginia ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Accountability ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Family member ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' tool ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' chronic hepatitis B virus infection ', ' chronic HBV infection ', ' Chronic Hepatitis B ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Medical center ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health organization ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' vaccine testing ', ' vaccine screening ', ' vaccine evaluation ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Community Health ', ' informant ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Instruction ', ' Minority ', ' hepatitis B virus vaccination ', ' HBV Vaccination ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' health information technology ', ' data registry ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMHD,ASSOCIATION/ASIAN PACIFIC CMTY HLTH ORGS,R24,2013,316159,0.0602652861236531

"Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN)    DESCRIPTION: Moffitt Cancer Center and an established network of community partners propose the formation of a regional Center for addressing the cancer burden in a tri-county area. This Center builds on the significant successes of an existing community-academic network program called the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network, draws on enriching programmatic partnerships, and builds on our considerable experience in developing innovative education, training and research programs that recognize the importance of culture and literacy in cancer care. The Center strengthens our community-based infrastructure that is currently characterized by relevant, sincere and trustworthy partnerships that serve medically underserved individuals and families, and which cuts across all racial/ethnic groups including a growing number of foreign-born populations. Grounded in methodological approaches that use community-based participatory research (CBPR), Center aims are to: increase knowledge of, access, and use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures through health promotion and outreach activities; conduct innovative evidence-based research following CBPR principles and to train qualified health disparity researchers in using CBPR approaches. The Center is   comprised of an Administrative Core that provides oversight and three highly complementary Programs   (Outreach, Research and Training) that work synergistically with members of the Steering Committee and Community Advisory Group. The Outreach Program, anchored by activities that engage communities around cancer prevention and control activities, centers on dissemination of credible resources, and makes linkages to the NCI National Outreach Network. The Research Program addresses several determinants (access, knowledge and health literacy) that impact health disparities, and offers solutions by conduct of an investigator initiated intervention research study for increasing uptake of colorectal cancer screening, and a pilot educational research project that extends the CNP Center's interests in biobanking. The Training Program draws on the tenets of mentoring, collaboration and networking, and innovatively puts into place didactic and immersion training opportunities involving academic and community mentors.             The goal of the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network is to find ways to reduce the cancer burden among medically underserved populations in our community.

This county not only has diversity in its ethnic/racial composition but also a large population of persons who are uninsured or underinsured and of limited English proficiency. This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement.

"NU:  NEIGHBORS:  A Social Science Partnership to Reduce Cancer Disparities ( 1 of DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (RHLCCC-NU) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) - the only Midwestern four-year Hispanic Serving Institution are partnering to establish the NU-Northeastern Illinois Guild for Health Behavior Oncology Research & Science.  This NU NEIGHBORS application represents a strategic collaboration with the ultimate goal of reducing and eliminating cancer disparities which are prominent in Chicago. We aim to foster community-engaged, social science cancer disparities research, build a platform for public health-related curriculum modification, and create a pipeline of well-trained and experienced cancer researchers and students who choose health and science-related careers. NEIU has evolved into a comprehensive university with a track record of training highly qualified bachelor's and master's-level students for professional careers in the social sciences, education, and science fields. Complementary to NEIU strengths, RHLCCC-NU conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research with an excess of $158 million in annual extramural funding and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  This synergy will facilitate accomplishment of the following objectives: 1) to expose NEIU faculty and students to research conducted at RHLCCC-NU in the areas of medical social sciences, community engagement and health disparities; 2) to enhance RHLCCC-NU and NEIUs collaborative research efforts and networking opportunities through increased participation in conferences and symposia; 3) to introduce cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research principles through workshops, seminars, lectures, community/university outreach, and academic instruction; 4) to incorporate team-based research projects that will generate a steady pipeline of students to continue advanced studies; 5) to incorporate innovative experience-learning curricular modifications to expose students to cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research; and 6) to develop scientists who will succeed in securing funding that addresses cancer disparities. We propose a three-pronged approach to achieve these objectives.  First, in the initial planning phase, we will establish our administrative leadership and a community steering committee (CSC) focused on integrating scientific research training, education modification, and community engagement throughout the 4 years of this effort. Second, administrative leadership and the CSC will work to set priorities. Finally, during the implementation stage, we will conduct a series of NEIU-NU pilot research and education projects meant to develop into competitive and collaborative research and training grants and a larger U54 MSI-CCC Partnership Grant. Collectively, these efforts will engage the diverse faculty and student populations at NEIU and NU into a cohesive network of cancer-related social sciences research and education aimed at reducing cancer health disparities. RELEVANCE: The presence of major cancer health disparities in Chicago is well-documented, and this proposed partnership poses a unique approach to reduce deeply-engrained disparities. NU NEIGHBORS is a partnership in research and education; we aim to foster and enhance efforts to build a pipeline of students entering health-related careers, increase the number of cancer health disparities researchers and facilitate translation of cancer research to Chicago land communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",NU:  NEIGHBORS:  A Social Science Partnership to Reduce Cancer Disparities ( 1 of,8543600,P20CA165588,"['Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Graduate Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Illinois ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mentorship ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Students ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' skills training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' science education ', ' success ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' outreach ', ' technological innovation ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' R25 Program ', ' R25 Mechanism ', ' Education Projects ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Qualifying ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' social science research ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,P20,2013,175721,0.014875794614402355
"Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Regional CNP located in Alameda County, California the home to one and a half million people and the most diverse county in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has large populations of Asian American (25%), Hispanic Americans (22%), African Americans (17%), and a decreasing Euro-American population (37%), and is the home of the largest group of Afghan refugees in the US. This county not only has diversity in its ethnic/racial composition but also a large population of persons who are uninsured or underinsured and of limited English proficiency. This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement.          At a time of reduced resources, low income populations who are uninsured and of limited English proficiency bear a disproportionate share of the burden of cancer. This CNP will provide the opportunity to increase collaboration between communities of color, academic institutions and health serving organizations to make more efficient use of existing

"Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC2) Center to Reduce Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Western New York (WNY) communities suffer from significant disparities in tobacco use and cessation practices, participation in research opportunities and rates of lung, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers. The proposed Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC) Center will address the most striking of these disparities and the burden of cancer in our region by focusing our efforts on minority and urban communities and clinical practices in the cities of Buffalo and Niagara Falls and rural Appalachian communities in neighboring Chautauqua County. We approach the reduction of disparities with clinical and community partnerships from a socio ecological model, with efforts to enhance social capital and reduce perceived racism. The goal of the Center is to ensure that all residents benefit from available clinical and scientific advances to reduce tobacco use, promote healthy lifestyles and behaviors, detect cancer early and participate in clinical and research programs in order to eliminate cancer inequities. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Enhance clinical environments by providing resources, training, outreach and interventions to improve the quality of clinical practice. Aim 2. Enhance outreach to the community by providing technical assistance and tailored outreach interventions to community organizations and partners to increase knowledge of, access to, and use of, beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures. Aim 3. Enhance CBPR training by provide training, mentoring, CBPR and trans-disciplinary research experiences and resources to prepare junior investigators and post-doctoral fellows. Aim 4. Conduct rigorous CBPR research by investigating variables and methods with our community partners to reduce cancer disparities. We propose a full ROI in collaboration with community PCP practices and patients to study the comparative effectiveness of practice enhancements to increase smoking cessation in African American and rural patients; and a pilot study with the Buffalo Latino community to study mechanisms to recruit participants to the cancer center biospecimen banking program. The WNYC^ Center also includes experienced leadership in an Administrative Core, multidimensional Outreach Program, and novel Training Program.          The proposed WNYC(2) Center is innovatively designed to reduce inequities in medically underserved populations in three counties in our region. This project will positively impact current public health programs and enhance outreach and training resources that will improve clinical care, participation in research, and reduce tobacco use in urban, minority and rural populations with the highest risk and cancer burden.",Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC2) Center to Reduce Disparities,8602699,U54CA153598,"['Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Buffaloes ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Leadership ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Training Programs ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Clinical ', ' racism ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' treatment program ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' High-Risk Cancer ', ' Qualifying ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Roswell Park Cancer Institute ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,U54,2013,756828,-0.023037428091824932
"Southeast Michigan Community Network Program DESCRIPTION: This application, in response to RFA-CA-09-032, Community Networks Program (U54), proposes to continue our vibrant, comprehensive, and sustainable program to reduce disparities in breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in southeast Michigan. Under CNP I, we have mobilized with extraordinary community partners to implement an integrated system of community-based participatory education, training, and research activities. Our regional CNP II Center will include four large urban areas severely impacted by economic hardship: Detroit, Inkster, Southfield, and Pontiac. This tri-county area accounts for 71.3% of Michigan's African American population and 42% of the state's below poverty population. In SE Michigan, older African Americans have higher rates of poverty and comorbid medical diseases related to being underserved medically (5, 6). Our team of collaborating investigators and community partners will continue to build on our established partnerships. The effort will be led by the Karmanos Cancer Institute, the School of Medicine at Wayne State University, and the Josephine Ford Cancer Center of the Henry Ford Health System. Support for our CNP I and now CNP II is broadly based, demonstrated by the community leaders, researchers, clinicians and public officials with whom we have strong relationships and who have joined our Center Steering Committee and Community Advisory Group, and have written letters of support included in this application. We propose a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach to address three aims for reducing disparities: Aim 1. To continue to increase knowledge, access and use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures to reduce disparities related to breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer, among older, underserved African American adults in southeast Michigan; Aim 2. To continue to develop and implement evidence-based intervention research to increase use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures for cancer prevention, detection and treatment of older African Americans; and Aim 3. To recruit and train a critical mass of promising and successful new researchers in CBPR to reduce cancer health disparities. RELEVANCE (See Instructions):  Older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of cancers, are first diagnosed at advanced stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates. Our proposed CNP has high public health relevance because our goal is to continue our catalytic effort to sustain a strong community based health movement that will improve knowledge of, access to, and usage of beneficial behavioral and biomedical interventions to reduce cancer disparities and improve detection diagnosis treatment and survivorship",Southeast Michigan Community Network Program,8921518,U54CA153606,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Award ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Michigan ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' survivorship ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' County ', ' Medically Uninsured ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Medically Underinsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Research Activity ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Letters ', ' Community Networks ', ' Staging ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' economic impact ', ' social ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Preventive screening ', ' Instruction ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' safety net ', ' community organizations ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U54,2014,100000,-0.002003021423115957
"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network -- II DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network N's overarching goal is to contribute materially to: understanding the underlying causes of cancer-related health disparities; discovering and developing effective innovations to lower incidence, improving survival, and reducing suffering; delivering these innovations to high-risk populations and moving them to widespread dissemination. We focus on African Americans (AAs) in South Carolina, a group in a region with much higher-than-average cancer incidence and extraordinarily high mortality given incidence. Our goal will be realized by achieving these Specific Aims: 1. to increase the knowledge base needed to understand which biomedical and behavioral procedures are most likely to prevent and control cancer in the high-risk African-American communities in South Carolina; 2. to develop and test interventions that are likely to reduce cancer incidence, downstage disease at time of diagnosis, increase longevity, and improve quality of life in people with cancer; 3. To deliver interventions shown to be effective to places of greatest receptivity and public health need and to evaluate them in terms of generalizability (i.e., external validity); and 4. To disseminate results from successful interventions in the form of intervention ""packages"" within our communities in South Carolina and to work with national partners to determine and distinguish universal elements that will work most (or at least many) places and others that are more place- and culture-specific. The success of SCCDCN-ll is predicated on: strong community support; dedication to the principles of community-based participatory research; understanding that the philosophical underpinnings and practical methods of applying knowledge are essentially the same across interdisciplinary, translational and community-based participatory research; that the tripartite missions of research, education, and service are both inseparable and highly interdependent; and that training of the next generation of scientists dedicated to the highest ideals of community-based participatory, interdisciplinary, and translational research is necessary in order to reduce, and then finally eliminate cancer-related health disparities. The SCCDCN-ll builds on work begun in CNP-I that allows us to expand programming to reduce, and finally eliminate entirely, cancer-related health disparities.

"Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) DESCRIPTION: In response to RFA CA-09-032, the Center for Asian Health of Temple University proposes to establish a regional Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) to address the cancer burden and co-morbidities among underserved Asian American populations through community outreach, research, and training. The proposed Center builds upon the successful collaborations that were fostered during the previous ATECAR SPN and ATECAR CNP-I cycles and consists of academic institutions, community organizations, and community healthcare providers. The ACCHDC will work towards the overall goal of reducing cancer health disparities by increasing knowledge of, access to and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures in underserved Asian American communities. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to guide all Center activities, which fall within four components: the Administrative Core (AC), Community Outreach Program (COP), Research Program (RP) and Training Program (TP). The AC will provide essential administrative, scientific, programmatic, and community leadership and timely coordination of Center operations. The COP will focus on building cancer control capacity and increasing knowledge and access to cancer prevention among the multi-ethnic and multilingual Asian communities in the eastern region of the US (PA, NJ and NYC). Under the RP, a large-scale controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBPR colorectal cancer (CRC) intervention in increasing screening, knowledge of, perceived risks of and susceptibility to CRC and benefits of screening, as well as reducing health system barriers to screening. The pilot study, led by a junior investigator, will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate education intervention in increasing knowledge of and intent to participate in Hepatitis B biospecimen research and examining cultural factors associated with the participation in biospecimen research. The TP will develop and implement a comprehensive research training program in CBPR methods and provide mentorship and key resources to junior researchers from racial/ethnic minority and underrepresented groups.

"Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is now the leading cause of death in the state of North Carolina. In 2006, over 17,000 North Carolinians died from cancer. African Americans carry a disproportionate burden of cancer disease, with higher mortality rates than Caucasians from prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer. The Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) will leverage the myriad successes of CCN I and continue to promote the community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in adhering to the established mission of reducing cancer health disparities among adult African Americans in North Carolina. CCN II will be based at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will provide a three-pronged research infrastructure that includes: Outreach, Research, and Training. CCN II will continue to work with faith-based and secular community groups in two regional areas in North Carolina that comprise 13 urban and rural counties. CCN II program activities will be undertaken through the coordinating efforts of the Administrative Core, the partnership strengthening activities of the Community Outreach Program and the junior faculty development activities of the Training Program to form a comprehensive, interactive, community-academic research center.   Specifically, 1) the Administrative core will provide scientific leadership and direction to all three of CCN M's programs, cultivating cohesion and synergy to meet Center goals; 2) the Community Outreach Program will provide needs assessments, culturally sensitive cancer education, and targeted health promotion and dissemination efforts in concert with existing Community Partners; 3) the Training Program will identify, instruct and support the development of early-stage investigators interested in developing their own health disparities research programs using the CBPR approach; and 4) the Research Program will support the conduct of an evidence-based intervention study to increase colorectal cancer screening rates among African Americans using data generated from CCN I preliminary research and existing partnerships. Racial/ethnic minorities carry a greater burden of cancer than other population groups. Although there are many beneficial biomedical and behavioral services available for cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, many health disparities continue because these benefits are not shared by all.

"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network -- II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network N's overarching goal is to contribute materially to: understanding the underlying causes of cancer-related health disparities; discovering and developing effective innovations to lower incidence, improving survival, and reducing suffering; delivering these innovations to high-risk populations and moving them to widespread dissemination. We focus on African Americans (AAs) in South Carolina, a group in a region with much higher-than-average cancer incidence and extraordinarily high mortality given incidence. Our goal will be realized by achieving these Specific Aims: 1. to increase the knowledge base needed to understand which biomedical and behavioral procedures are most likely to prevent and control cancer in the high-risk African-American communities in South Carolina; 2. to develop and test interventions that are likely to reduce cancer incidence, downstage disease at time of diagnosis, increase longevity, and improve quality of life in people with cancer; 3. To deliver interventions shown to be effective to places of greatest receptivity and public health need and to evaluate them in terms of generalizability (i.e., external validity); and 4. To disseminate results from successful interventions in the form of intervention ""packages"" within our communities in South Carolina and to work with national partners to determine and distinguish universal elements that will work most (or at least many) places and others that are more place- and culture-specific. The success of SCCDCN-ll is predicated on: strong community support; dedication to the principles of community-based participatory research; understanding that the philosophical underpinnings and practical methods of applying knowledge are essentially the same across interdisciplinary, translational and community-based participatory research; that the tripartite missions of research, education, and service are both inseparable and highly interdependent; and that training of the next generation of scientists dedicated to the highest ideals of community-based participatory, interdisciplinary, and translational research is necessary in order to reduce, and then finally eliminate cancer-related health disparities.              The SCCDCN-ll builds on work begun in CNP-I that allows us to expand programming to reduce, and finally eliminate entirely, cancer-related health disparities.

"Lay Health Worker Model to Reduce Liver Cancer Disparities in Asian Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is globally most common and serious viral infection of the liver. It can cause premature death from liver diseases or liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection and liver cancer caused by HBV among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) is one of the most serious - but frequently neglected-health disparity issues in the U.S. AAPIs account for over half of the 1.3 million chronic hepatitis B cases and deaths from HBV infection. This excess risk can be attributed to high rates of HBV infection (particularly among first-generation immigrants) in combination with low rates of HBV screening and vaccination due to cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers. HBV infection affect Asian Americans disproportionately, and thus it leads to a huge liver cancer disparity among Asian Americans compared to other racial/ethnic groups.  In response to these cancer disparities, the objective of this project is to build a sustainable, community-based, participator program of lay health workers (LHWs) who can promote liver cancer prevention programs among high-risk groups of Asian Americans. This proposed study attempts to implement culturally integrated liver cancer prevention programs for Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americans through outreach, screening, education, research, and training in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The specific aims are: (1) To develop a training protocol and certificate program for LHWs; (2) To assess the prevalence of HBV infection; (3) To implement intervention programs, based on screening test results; and (4) To evaluate the effectiveness of LHW intervention on adherence to HBV vaccinations among those unprotected.  A total of 600 Asian American adults (200 Chinese, Koreans, and Vietnamese in each group), 18 years of age and older will be recruited from the community. Trained and certified LHWs will recruit participants at community-based organizations and hep B free screening events. All the eligible participants will complete a self-administered questionnaire and receive liver cancer education. Then, they will receive hepatitis B test. Every participant will receive the results of screening tests by mail or phone. We will provide referral services for treatment to those infected. For those unprotected, we will implement intervention programs to increase a series of vaccinations within 6 months using a randomized controlled design. Seven months after mailing the results, we will conduct telephone interviews among those unprotected. Upon completing follow-up, those in the control will receive the delayed LHW intervention. The insights gained from this proposed LHW intervention will be valuable in implementing liver cancer prevention programs for other high-risk non-English speaking populations and will address health disparities among immigrant populations.          We will develop and build a sustainable, community-based participatory program to promote live cancer prevention programs for Asian Americans through outreach, education, screening, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of chronic HBV infection in the Baltimore Washington Metropolitan Area.

This NU NEIGHBORS application represents a strategic collaboration with the ultimate goal of reducing and eliminating cancer disparities which are prominent in Chicago. We aim to foster community-engaged, social science cancer disparities research, build a platform for public health-related curriculum modification, and create a pipeline of well-trained and experienced cancer researchers and students who choose health and science-related careers. NEIU has evolved into a comprehensive university with a track record of training highly qualified bachelor's and master's-level students for professional careers in the social sciences, education, and science fields. Complementary to NEIU strengths, RHLCCC-NU conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research with an excess of $158 million in annual extramural funding and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  This synergy will facilitate accomplishment of the following objectives: 1) to expose NEIU faculty and students to research conducted at RHLCCC-NU in the areas of medical social sciences, community engagement and health disparities; 2) to enhance RHLCCC-NU and NEIUs collaborative research efforts and networking opportunities through increased participation in conferences and symposia; 3) to introduce cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research principles through workshops, seminars, lectures, community/university outreach, and academic instruction; 4) to incorporate team-based research projects that will generate a steady pipeline of students to continue advanced studies; 5) to incorporate innovative experience-learning curricular modifications to expose students to cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research; and 6) to develop scientists who will succeed in securing funding that addresses cancer disparities. We propose a three-pronged approach to achieve these objectives.  First, in the initial planning phase, we will establish our administrative leadership and a community steering committee (CSC) focused on integrating scientific research training, education modification, and community engagement throughout the 4 years of this effort. Second, administrative leadership and the CSC will work to set priorities. Finally, during the implementation stage, we will conduct a series of NEIU-NU pilot research and education projects meant to develop into competitive and collaborative research and training grants and a larger U54 MSI-CCC Partnership Grant. Collectively, these efforts will engage the diverse faculty and student populations at NEIU and NU into a cohesive network of cancer-related social sciences research and education aimed at reducing cancer health disparities.

"Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the United States. Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take part in cancer prevention and screening activities than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. The overall goal of this project is to work collaboratively with regional partners to reduce cancer disparities. It is the long-term goal of this proposed Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to reduce the cancer disparities experienced by Hispanics in the two regions selected for this project. Our short-term objectives are to:   1. Develop and enhance our existing relationships with community partners in Regions 1 and 2 to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos and members of the Yakama Nation (Administrative Core)   2. Increase health promotion outreach and cancer screening activities among Latinos and members of   the Yakama Nation (Outreach Core); 3. Increase cervical cancer screening among Latinas using a rigorous research project (Research Core); 4. Develop and assess the feasibility of a sustainable support system for cancer patients and survivors (research Core); and 5. Train junior investigators, especially underrepresented minorities, in grant writing and CBPR to reduce cancer disparities.    This proposed Community Networks Program (CNP) builds on our existing CNP (2005 - 2010). It proposes to add a randomized clinical trial to assess two different approaches to motivate cervical cancer screening. Further it adds a patient navigator approach to reduce time to follow-up of an abnormal pap test. The pilot project builds on existing community concerns. Through its outreach core, the proposed Center will spread information and support at the population level. The training core will help train a new generation of scientists in CBPR and scientific research. Through its four cores, the proposed Center will cover a myriad of cancer disparities and assist NCI in its endeavor to reduce such disparities. Latinos are at high risk for specific types of cancer and have a higher mortality rate for other types of cancer.  In this project, we will increase cancer education and outreach to Latinos as well as conduct research to reduce their cancer disparities.

"Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Intiative (1 of 2)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal entitled the Chicago Southside Cancer Disparities Initiative (CSCDI) seeks support to form a partnership between the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC), a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and Chicago State University (CSU), a minority serving institution, to develop an infrastructure for cancer education, training and outreach. Abiding to the call for action to increase underrepresented minorities in the health care workforce as a mechanism to reduce disparities and advance research pertinent to the community, it is critical that we develop educational and academic pathways to increase knowledge transfer at the undergraduate and graduate levels. To this end, the CSCDI's objectives are to: 1) Create an Inter-University collaboration to develop, implement and evaluate cancer disparities curriculum to be integrated within selected CSU's current MPH curriculum as well as UC's Pritzker School of Medicine's (PSOM) curriculum. 2) Provide opportunities for community involvement through collaboratively developing and enhancing existing service learning sites(i.e. community organization) at both institutions; 3) Train MPH cohorts to engage service learning sites(i.e. community organization) in cancer prevention, health promotion and dissemination of cancer research; and 4) Expand education and training beyond the 4-year grant period by utilizing an NCI mechanism Cancer Education Program (R25E) or other federal agency collaborative research training grant There is a pressing need to improve cancer outcomes in Chicago. Specifically, UCCCC has been a leading institution for groundbreaking cancer research and technological advances. However, impact at the community level has been challenging and research dissemination into communities has been weak. CSU, an urban public University has had a long history of education, leadership and commitment to the Chicago's Southside. CSU has recently developed a new Master of Public Health (MPH) program to focus on minority health and health equity, providing an exciting opportunity for our partnership. However, despite CSU's strengths and reach, their research program and expertise in cancer disparities are tenuous, while cancer disparities on Chicago's Southside are on the rise. CSCDI, therefore, is an innovative and timely partnership that will bridge outstanding minority students and faculty together with nationally recognized educators and researchers in the field of cancer to increase the pool of minority public health professionals interested in studying cancer disparities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer disparities among minority communities continue to grow. It is time to affect change by diversifying the health professional work force, a critical stp to the continued progress of cancer research, knowledge transfer and the understanding of cancer disparities among marginalized groups.

The proposed Center arises from an established community-academic practice partnership that has been active across the two counties, in delivery of cancer screening services, and in research. These predominantly African American counties differ in socio economic status, but both experience disproportionate mortality due to breast, cervix and colorectal cancer. The objective of this proposal is to create an infrastructure to support community-driven research that creates training opportunities for early-stage investigators. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To establish an Administrative Core to provide leadership for the Center's overall strategic planning, including scientific leader-ship-and-oversight-on using-the-GBPR approach and its core-principles; 2) To develop a Community- Outreach Program that leverages existing community outreach initiatives targeted to multiethnic underserved populations in Baltimore City and Prince George's County; 3) To implement a Research Program consisting of two projects: a) the Full Research Project, ""Evaluating Coaches of Older Adults for Cancer Care and Healthy Behaviors (COACH)"", a randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of trained, participant designated coaches vs. professionally-based navigators, in supporting adherence to cancer screening; and b) the Pilot Educational Research Project, a mixed-methods study that examines knowledge, attitudes and willingness of multiethnic older adults to participate in a cancer-related biospecimen repository; 4) To establish a Training Program with the primary goal of increasing the number of qualified health disparity researchers experienced in using CBPR in the context of cancer disparities. The CNP Center at Johns Hopkins will create a sustainable infrastructure for community based participatory research on a large, multiple project, highly collaborative scale, It will increase knowledge of, access to, and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures related to cancer in areas ranging from prevention to early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.

"Reducing Asian Hepatitis B Disparities through Health Information Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major preventable health problem in the U.S. and the most pronounced health disparity disfavoring Asian Americans. Unfortunately, HBV patients, especially immigrants and minorities, often do not receive recommended levels of care, indicating a critical need for developing culturally appropriate and effective strategies that can be incorporated into existing clinical practice. The proposed project is a community-scientific collaboration between the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO) and its federally qualified health center member, International Community Health Services (ICHS) in Seattle, WA, as well as our scientific partner affiliated with the University of Washington and Virginia Mason Medical Center, and members of a community-based organization, the Hepatitis B Coalition of Washington. The project will assess the impact of culturally proficient Health Information Technology (HIT) strategies for underserved Asian Americans in Seattle, WA infected with HBV. Community-based participatory approaches will be utilized to conduct a needs assessment and develop a new culturally appropriate intervention to address HBV health disparities applicable across Asian American communities. Mixed methods, including key informant interviews, focus groups, and surveys, that incorporate community participation and perspectives from underserved HBV patients, family members, and providers, will be used to assess the impact of and needs for culturally proficient HIT strategies to improve HBV outcomes for underserved Asian Americans attending a community clinic in Seattle's International j District. The results from the needs assessment will be utilized to develop a pilot intervention incorporating HIT strategies for HBV care with participation and ownership from community-based health centers and their stakeholders. Quantitative methods will be used to test the effectiveness of the culturally proficient intervention in improving HBV vaccination, screening rates, and linkages to care. This project will serve as an important model for developing culturally proficient HBV care approaches integrating health services, HIT, and enabling services (or non-clinical support services) for underserved communities in the U.S.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project was started up by Asian hepatitis b doctors and patients at a clinic, because hepatitis b has become a big issue for Asian people. The clinic's patients, their families, and doctors will work with researchers and partners to find ways to improve hepatitis b care in the clinic and to help educate patients and their families.

"Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECAD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECaD) at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center, St Louis, MO of Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital was established in 2003 with institutional funds in response to known excess cancer burden within the region particularly for minority and medically underserved populations. The Goals are to create a national model for eliminating disparities In cancer through community-based partnerships and community based participatory research (CBPR); to increase access by breaking down barriers to quality cancer care; and to be a catalyst for change in our region by fostering healthy communities. Given the fractured history of St Louis and its segregation, PECaD has worked with numerous community organizations and provider groups to build trust and has harnessed resources from non federal sources and NCI. We now propose to further strengthen partnerships in the St. Louis region and extend our activities to additional areas chosen based on poverty levels; limited access to cancer screening and prevention services; excess cancer incidence or mortality; and expressed community Interest In collaborative efforts to address cancer health disparities. Our three communities are St Louis City and North County, MO; St. Clair County, IL, and southeastern Missouri. The Specific aims are: 1. In collaboration with our community partners, using the community outreach program and working with our community partnerships, we will extend and evaluate the effectiveness of outreach. 2. In a research project created in partnership with our colorectal cancer community partnership, we will design and conduct a RCT of community awareness plus systems level changes to reinforce provider behavior change to order and follow-up on colorectal cancer screening tests. 3. In our pilot educational research project created with our prostate cancer community partnership, we will evaluate barriers and facilitators to participation in prostate CA tissue collection for research (biobanking). 4. Through our training program, provide CBPR training for researchers and community members collaborating with the program and institute an ongoing process for Identifying and vetting future pilot projects. 5. In conjunction with our community Disparities Elimination Advisory Committee (DEAC), we will develop a framework for evaluation within and across our Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs.          Excess cancer mortality In low income, minority and underserved populations will be addressed through community based participatory research projects that bring prevention information and access to 3 high risk populations.

"Southeast Michigan Community Network Program    DESCRIPTION: This application, in response to RFA-CA-09-032, Community Networks Program (U54), proposes to continue our vibrant, comprehensive, and sustainable program to reduce disparities in breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in southeast Michigan. Under CNP I, we have mobilized with extraordinary community partners to implement an integrated system of community-based participatory education, training, and research activities. Our regional CNP II Center will include four large urban areas severely impacted by economic hardship: Detroit, Inkster, Southfield, and Pontiac. This tri-county area accounts for 71.3% of Michigan's African American population and 42% of the state's below poverty population. In SE Michigan, older African Americans have higher rates of poverty and comorbid medical diseases related to being underserved medically (5, 6). Our team of collaborating investigators and community partners will continue to build on our established partnerships. The effort will be led by the Karmanos Cancer Institute, the School of Medicine at Wayne State University, and the Josephine Ford Cancer Center of the Henry Ford Health System. Support for our CNP I and now CNP II is broadly based, demonstrated by the community leaders, researchers, clinicians and public officials with whom we have strong relationships and who have joined our Center Steering Committee and Community Advisory Group, and have written letters of support included in this application. We propose a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach to address three aims for reducing disparities: Aim 1. To continue to increase knowledge, access and use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures to reduce disparities related to breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer, among older, underserved African American adults in southeast Michigan; Aim 2. To continue to develop and implement evidence-based intervention research to increase use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures for cancer prevention, detection and treatment of older African Americans; and Aim 3. To recruit and train a critical mass of promising and successful new researchers in CBPR to reduce cancer health disparities.          RELEVANCE (See Instructions):  Older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of cancers, are first diagnosed at advanced stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates.

The goal of the Center is to ensure that all residents benefit from available clinical and scientific advances to reduce tobacco use, promote healthy lifestyles and behaviors, detect cancer early and participate in clinical and research programs in order to eliminate cancer inequities. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Enhance clinical environments by providing resources, training, outreach and interventions to improve the quality of clinical practice. Aim 2. Enhance outreach to the community by providing technical assistance and tailored outreach interventions to community organizations and partners to increase knowledge of, access to, and use of, beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures. Aim 3. Enhance CBPR training by provide training, mentoring, CBPR and trans-disciplinary research experiences and resources to prepare junior investigators and post-doctoral fellows. Aim 4. Conduct rigorous CBPR research by investigating variables and methods with our community partners to reduce cancer disparities. We propose a full ROI in collaboration with community PCP practices and patients to study the comparative effectiveness of practice enhancements to increase smoking cessation in African American and rural patients; and a pilot study with the Buffalo Latino community to study mechanisms to recruit participants to the cancer center biospecimen banking program. The WNYC^ Center also includes experienced leadership in an Administrative Core, multidimensional Outreach Program, and novel Training Program. The proposed WNYC(2) Center is innovatively designed to reduce inequities in medically underserved populations in three counties in our region. This project will positively impact current public health programs and enhance outreach and training resources that will improve clinical care, participation in research, and reduce tobacco use in urban, minority and rural populations with the highest risk and cancer burden.",Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC2) Center to Reduce Disparities,8894150,U54CA153598,"['Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Buffaloes ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Leadership ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Training Programs ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Clinical ', ' racism ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' treatment program ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' High-Risk Cancer ', ' Qualifying ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Roswell Park Cancer Institute ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,U54,2014,52027,-0.023037428091824932
"Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP) University of Washington (UW) and Black Hills Center for American Indian Health (BHCAIH) seek support for Native People for Cancer Control (NPCC), a currently-funded regional Community Networks Program (CNP). NPCC is organized into an Administrative Core and Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs. Directorship of NPCC will be shared by Dedra Buchwald, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director, Partnerships for Native Health, UW; and Jeffrey Henderson (Cheyenne River Sioux), MD, MPH, President and CEO of the community-based, non-profit BHCAIH in Rapid City, SD. NPCC serves an 8-state region and is headquartered at UW in Seattle, with 3 additional sites that align geographically with the conduct of our Community Outreach Program activities. Site 1 includes Washington, Alaska, and Oregon; Site 2 includes Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming; and Site 3 includes North and South Dakota. NPCC will include 15 American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) investigators, staff, and partners. AI/ANs have the poorest 5-year survival from all cancers combined among all U.S. racial/ethnic groups,(12) and access to cancer clinical trials is difficult. Our overarching aim, therefore, is to directly contribute to improved cancer health outcomes and quality of life for AI/AN populations, which experience dramatic health inequities. Our central strategy is to capitalize on opportunities and leverage existing resources to pursue an integrated, multifaceted research program that is catalyzed by tight partnerships with Native communities. We will address cancer health issues ranging from prevention and clinical trials to survivorship. Our long-term goal is to generate findings that can be translated into practices and policies that will reduce AI/AN cancer-related health disparities. Thus, our Specific Aims are to: 1) increase cancer education, outreach, health promotion, and prevention efforts among urban and rural AI/ANs through the activities of the Community Outreach Program; 2) conduct 1 Research Project, 2 CNP Pilot Projects, and 2 Training Projects using community-based participatory methods that focus on colorectal cancer screening, health literacy and communication, cancer risk factors and care, and clinical trials education among Al/ANs; 3) train at least 5 AI/AN junior faculty members to conduct research through the efforts of the Training Program; and 4) reduce cancer health disparities by increasing access to, and use of, interventions among AI/AN populations through all NPCC activities. These activities will be coordinated by the Administrative Core. With a wide network of partners, 25 funded cancer-related grants and 54 publications by NPCC-affiliated investigators, NPPC has the essential elements of a successful CNP, both as an individual site and as a member of the CNP network. Healthy People 2010 focuses on health disparities, yet progress reports revealed minimal improvement for Al/ANs in areas previously identified as problematic. For example, only 62% of AI/ANs had health insurance, virtually unchanged over the previous 4 years, and life expectancy for AI/ANs was up to 8 years shorter than for non-Al/ANs. Cancer morbidity, mortality, risk prevalence, and barriers to care remain major problems in Native communities. Concerted, coordinated, multidisciplinary efforts are needed to redress the striking cancer-related disparities experienced by this vulnerable population.",Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP),8922377,U54CA153498,"['Alaska ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Idaho ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Montana ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' North Dakota ', ' Oregon ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' South Dakota ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Wyoming ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Native Americans ', ' Community Networks ', ' Rivers ', ' programs ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' member ', ' sioux community ', ' Sioux ', ' Sioux Indians ', ' Prevention ', ' outreach program ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer education ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Health Communication ', ' Research Training ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Outreach Research ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U54,2014,99999,0.023863481788328166
"Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the United States. Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take part in cancer prevention and screening activities than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. The overall goal of this project is to work collaboratively with regional partners to reduce cancer disparities. It is the long-term goal of this proposed Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to reduce the cancer disparities experienced by Hispanics in the two regions selected for this project. Our short-term objectives are to:   1. Develop and enhance our existing relationships with community partners in Regions 1 and 2 to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos and members of the Yakama Nation (Administrative Core)   2. Increase health promotion outreach and cancer screening activities among Latinos and members of   the Yakama Nation (Outreach Core); 3. Increase cervical cancer screening among Latinas using a rigorous research project (Research Core); 4. Develop and assess the feasibility of a sustainable support system for cancer patients and survivors (research Core); and 5. Train junior investigators, especially underrepresented minorities, in grant writing and CBPR to reduce cancer disparities.    This proposed Community Networks Program (CNP) builds on our existing CNP (2005 - 2010). It proposes to add a randomized clinical trial to assess two different approaches to motivate cervical cancer screening. Further it adds a patient navigator approach to reduce time to follow-up of an abnormal pap test. The pilot project builds on existing community concerns. Through its outreach core, the proposed Center will spread information and support at the population level. The training core will help train a new generation of scientists in CBPR and scientific research. Through its four cores, the proposed Center will cover a myriad of cancer disparities and assist NCI in its endeavor to reduce such disparities. Latinos are at high risk for specific types of cancer and have a higher mortality rate for other types of cancer.  In this project, we will increase cancer education and outreach to Latinos as well as conduct research to reduce their cancer disparities.

"Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Regional CNP located in Alameda County, California the home to one and a half million people and the most diverse county in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has large populations of Asian American (25%), Hispanic Americans (22%), African Americans (17%), and a decreasing Euro-American population (37%), and is the home of the largest group of Afghan refugees in the US. This county not only has diversity in its ethnic/racial composition but also a large population of persons who are uninsured or underinsured and of limited English proficiency. This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement. At a time of reduced resources, low income populations who are uninsured and of limited English proficiency bear a disproportionate share of the burden of cancer. This CNP will provide the opportunity to increase collaboration between communities of color, academic institutions and health serving organizations to make more efficient use of existing resources.",Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities,8890298,U54CA153506,"['Asian Americans ', ' Awareness ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Breast ', '

"Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Initiative ( 2 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal entitled the Chicago Southside Cancer Disparities Initiative (CSCDI) seeks support to form a partnership between the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC), a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and Chicago State University (CSU), a minority serving institution, to develop an infrastructure for cancer education, training and outreach. Abiding to the call for action to increase underrepresented minorities in the health care workforce as a mechanism to reduce disparities and advance research pertinent to the community, it is critical that we develop educational and academic pathways to increase knowledge transfer at the undergraduate and graduate levels. To this end, the CSCDI's objectives are to: 1) Create an Inter-University collaboration to develop, implement and evaluate cancer disparities curriculum to be integrated within selected CSU's current MPH curriculum as well as UC's Pritzker School of Medicine's (PSOM) curriculum. 2) Provide opportunities for community involvement through collaboratively developing and enhancing existing service learning sites(i.e. community organization) at both institutions; 3) Train MPH cohorts to engage service learning sites(i.e. community organization) in cancer prevention, health promotion and dissemination of cancer research; and 4) Expand education and training beyond the 4-year grant period by utilizing an NCI mechanism Cancer Education Program (R25E) or other federal agency collaborative research training grant There is a pressing need to improve cancer outcomes in Chicago. Specifically, UCCCC has been a leading institution for groundbreaking cancer research and technological advances. However, impact at the community level has been challenging and research dissemination into communities has been weak. CSU, an urban public University has had a long history of education, leadership and commitment to the Chicago's Southside. CSU has recently developed a new Master of Public Health (MPH) program to focus on minority health and health equity, providing an exciting opportunity for our partnership. However, despite CSU's strengths and reach, their research program and expertise in cancer disparities are tenuous, while cancer disparities on Chicago's Southside are on the rise. CSCDI, therefore, is an innovative and timely partnership that will bridge outstanding minority students and faculty together with nationally recognized educators and researchers in the field of cancer to increase the pool of minority public health professionals interested in studying cancer disparities.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer disparities among minority communities continue to grow. It is time to affect change by diversifying the health professional work force, a critical stp to the continued progress of cancer research, knowledge transfer and the understanding of cancer disparities among marginalized groups.  By providing education to a diverse public health workforce, we will improve dissemination, strengthen our reach and collaborate to affect change.",Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Initiative ( 2 of 2),8725093,P20CA165587,"['Affect ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mission ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' cohort ', ' cancer education ', ' Institution ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' M.P.H.

"Deep South Network for Cancer Control    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Deep South Network for Cancer Control (DSNCC) focuses on some of the most impoverished and underserved areas in the US. The rural MS Delta, AL Black Belt and inner city of Birmingham, AL and Hattiesburg, Laurel, MS have exceptionally high rates of cancer mortality, cancer disparity and obesity. The DSNCC has for 9 yrs systematically addressed the major cancer health concerns of these areas. A community based infrastructure was established that in collaboration with three academic institutions addressed disparity in cervical and breast cancer screening and more recently in colorectal cancer screening, lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating. During this period we have expanded our community infrastructure in our targeted areas to include a Community Network Partnership (CNP) in each county. Building upon our community-academic partnership, our success in promoting cancer screening, increasing physical activity and incorporating healthy eating into churches, we have the following overall Specific Aims: 1-Through the Community Outreach Core, promote screening for breast, cervix, and colorectal cancer and increased physical activity and healthy eating through a community based participatory approach that includes development of a Community Action Plan that targets all levels of the socio-ecological model; 2-   through the Research Core develop, implement, and evaluate the efficacy of a community-based,   participatory, culturally-relevant intervention to reduce body weight among African American women residing in rural communities in the Deep South through a group randomized trial.

"INTER-CAMBIO: Community-Academic Meetings to Bridge Initiatives in Obesity     DESCRIPTION: Obesity has been described as a national epidemic and is associated with a number of negative health outcomes, including higher rates of chronic disease (e.g., heart disease, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers), elevated health-care costs, decreased quality of life, and greater risk of premature death. Hispanics are disproportionally affected by obesity, having a 21% greater risk of being obese compared to non-Hispanic whites. One way to address obesity-related health disparities is through the creation of meaningful partnerships between academic institutions and community-based health organizations using an approach called community based participatory research (CBPR). OBJECTIVE: To establish a CBPR partnership between Northwestern University (NU) clinicians and researchers and the Chicago Hispanic Health Coalition (CHHC), a group of over 600 local health and social service agencies and community based organizations whose mission is to promote healthy behavior and prevent chronic disease and health disparities in the Hispanic communities of metropolitan Chicago. This partnership will jointly address racial health disparities among the Hispanic community as it relates to chronic stress and related cultural and environmental factors in the context of increasing engagement in obesity prevention and health promotion behaviors. STUDY DESIGN: We will form a collaborative research alliance, participate in capacity building, learning and professional development, and engage the Hispanic community through outreach and education. In Year 1, we will develop an advisory board, convene a community kickoff meeting, form a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between NU and CHHC, and host community forums for dissemination and outreach. In year 2 we will continue to have quarterly advisory board meetings and community forums. We will also develop an MOU with a second community based organization, Salud Latina. In year 3 we will continue quarterly advisory board meetings and community forums. We will also write and submit a grant proposal to build capacity within our developing alliance, enhance networks and infrastructure that will promote community-engaged research that not only takes place in the community, but involves the community; and foster preliminary work in health promotion and obesity prevention in the Hispanic community. RELEVANCE: This work will advance understanding and community-academic aligned strategies and action plans to prevent and reduce obesity among the Hispanic community through better understanding the role of chronic stress.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is a growing health problem in the United States, especially among the Hispanic community.   Academic-community partnerships based in community based participatory research (CBPR) are a useful way to generate novel ideas and solutions that possess scientific merit as well as community insight and acceptance.

"Biologic Basis of Disparity in Liver Cancer Survival Among Asian Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a blatant example of a cancer health disparity in that HCC is disproportionally higher in incidence and mortality among Asian Americans compared with non-Hispanic Whites. Infection by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the principal risk factor for HCC among Asian Americans. HCC survival rates have significantly improved among those whose cancer is detected early and treated aggressively, but remain short among those with advanced, and rapidly progressive disease. Thus elucidating biological mechanisms underlying the behavior of HBV-mediated HCC will potentially contribute to improved surveillance, treatment, control and prevention. Our long term goal is to understand epidemiologic causes, sociocultural barriers, and biologic mechanisms of HBV-related disparities, and to develop tools which can decrease the burden of these diseases on the Asian American community. In this study, we will compare viral factors and immune responses in HBV-infected Laotian and Hmong, who experience the highest HCC mortality rates among Asians, with HBV-infected Chinese and Vietnamese, who experience better survival rates. Importantly, Laotian and Hmong are also diagnosed at a younger age but with more advanced disease compared to other Asian ethnicities suggesting that there is a biologic basis to this disparity in HCC survival. Our central hypothesis is that differences in viral variants and host immune responses exist within the Laotian/Hmong population, which in part cause an earlier onset and more aggressive form of HCC, resulting in a disparity in HCC survival. We propose using next generation sequencing technologies to 1) compare viral factors associated with HCC prognosis in HBV-infected Laotian/Hmong to HBV-infected Chinese and Vietnamese and 2) assess immune responses associated with HCC survival in these same groups by gene expression activity of pro-inflammatory responses including NF?B-related genes and anti-inflammatory responses such as regulatory T cells, as well as T cell receptor usage and HLA allele frequencies. The impact of this study will be to improve the understanding of the biologic basis of disparities in HCC survival among Asian American ethnicities and may lead to better risk stratification and tailoring of treatment of HCC based upon host and viral factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal builds upon our six---year history of NIH---funded research on liver cancer health disparities among Asian Americans through a focused study to delineate some of the biologic factors responsible for the poor survival among Laotian and Hmong, who experience the lowest survival rates for liver cancer among any Asian ethnicity. Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer---related death in the world, and hence the information gained from these studies may lead to better treatment strategies for liver cancer.

"NU:  NEIGHBORS:  A Social Science Partnership to Reduce Cancer Disparities ( 1 of DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (RHLCCC-NU) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) - the only Midwestern four-year Hispanic Serving Institution are partnering to establish the NU-Northeastern Illinois Guild for Health Behavior Oncology Research & Science.  This NU NEIGHBORS application represents a strategic collaboration with the ultimate goal of reducing and eliminating cancer disparities which are prominent in Chicago. We aim to foster community-engaged, social science cancer disparities research, build a platform for public health-related curriculum modification, and create a pipeline of well-trained and experienced cancer researchers and students who choose health and science-related careers. NEIU has evolved into a comprehensive university with a track record of training highly qualified bachelor's and master's-level students for professional careers in the social sciences, education, and science fields. Complementary to NEIU strengths, RHLCCC-NU conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research with an excess of $158 million in annual extramural funding and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  This synergy will facilitate accomplishment of the following objectives: 1) to expose NEIU faculty and students to research conducted at RHLCCC-NU in the areas of medical social sciences, community engagement and health disparities; 2) to enhance RHLCCC-NU and NEIUs collaborative research efforts and networking opportunities through increased participation in conferences and symposia; 3) to introduce cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research principles through workshops, seminars, lectures, community/university outreach, and academic instruction; 4) to incorporate team-based research projects that will generate a steady pipeline of students to continue advanced studies; 5) to incorporate innovative experience-learning curricular modifications to expose students to cancer disparities, medical social sciences and community engaged research; and 6) to develop scientists who will succeed in securing funding that addresses cancer disparities. We propose a three-pronged approach to achieve these objectives.  First, in the initial planning phase, we will establish our administrative leadership and a community steering committee (CSC) focused on integrating scientific research training, education modification, and community engagement throughout the 4 years of this effort. Second, administrative leadership and the CSC will work to set priorities. Finally, during the implementation stage, we will conduct a series of NEIU-NU pilot research and education projects meant to develop into competitive and collaborative research and training grants and a larger U54 MSI-CCC Partnership Grant. Collectively, these efforts will engage the diverse faculty and student populations at NEIU and NU into a cohesive network of cancer-related social sciences research and education aimed at reducing cancer health disparities. RELEVANCE: The presence of major cancer health disparities in Chicago is well-documented, and this proposed partnership poses a unique approach to reduce deeply-engrained disparities. NU NEIGHBORS is a partnership in research and education; we aim to foster and enhance efforts to build a pipeline of students entering health-related careers, increase the number of cancer health disparities researchers and facilitate translation of cancer research to Chicago land communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",NU:  NEIGHBORS:  A Social Science Partnership to Reduce Cancer Disparities ( 1 of,8737204,P20CA165588,"['Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Graduate Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Illinois ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mentorship ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Students ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' skills training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' science education ', ' success ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' outreach ', ' technological innovation ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' R25 Program ', ' R25 Mechanism ', ' Education Projects ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Qualifying ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' social science research ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,P20,2014,135346,0.014875794614402355
"Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) DESCRIPTION: In response to RFA CA-09-032, the Center for Asian Health of Temple University proposes to establish a regional Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) to address the cancer burden and co-morbidities among underserved Asian American populations through community outreach, research, and training. The proposed Center builds upon the successful collaborations that were fostered during the previous ATECAR SPN and ATECAR CNP-I cycles and consists of academic institutions, community organizations, and community healthcare providers. The ACCHDC will work towards the overall goal of reducing cancer health disparities by increasing knowledge of, access to and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures in underserved Asian American communities. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to guide all Center activities, which fall within four components: the Administrative Core (AC), Community Outreach Program (COP), Research Program (RP) and Training Program (TP). The AC will provide essential administrative, scientific, programmatic, and community leadership and timely coordination of Center operations. The COP will focus on building cancer control capacity and increasing knowledge and access to cancer prevention among the multi-ethnic and multilingual Asian communities in the eastern region of the US (PA, NJ and NYC). Under the RP, a large-scale controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBPR colorectal cancer (CRC) intervention in increasing screening, knowledge of, perceived risks of and susceptibility to CRC and benefits of screening, as well as reducing health system barriers to screening. The pilot study, led by a junior investigator, will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate education intervention in increasing knowledge of and intent to participate in Hepatitis B biospecimen research and examining cultural factors associated with the participation in biospecimen research. The TP will develop and implement a comprehensive research training program in CBPR methods and provide mentorship and key resources to junior researchers from racial/ethnic minority and underrepresented groups. Center team members have forged successful collaborations during ATECAR SPN and CNP-I, have established strong partnerships with Asian communities and are dedicated to the Center's mission of reducing cancer health disparities in underserved Asian Americans. The proposed ACCHDC program will make a significant contributions toward enhancing our understanding of, and increasing our capacity to reduce, cancer health disparities among Asian Americans. In addition, the program has great potential for serving as a model program that can be implemented in other communities to achieve the NCI strategic goal of reaching underserved communities touched by cancer.",Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC),8921525,U54CA153513,"['Asian Americans ', ' Attitude ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chinese American ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Health Education ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Generations ', ' falls ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cervical ', ' Area ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' psychosocial ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' cancer risk ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' Korean American ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Qualifying ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Outreach Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' forging ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based program ', ' community organizations ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,U54,2014,100000,0.08231426612485664
"Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Regional CNP located in Alameda County, California the home to one and a half million people and the most diverse county in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has large populations of Asian American (25%), Hispanic Americans (22%), African Americans (17%), and a decreasing Euro-American population (37%), and is the home of the largest group of Afghan refugees in the US. This county not only has diversity in its ethnic/racial composition but also a large population of persons who are uninsured or underinsured and of limited English proficiency. This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement. At a time of reduced resources, low income populations who are uninsured and of limited English proficiency bear a disproportionate share of the burden of cancer. This CNP will provide the opportunity to increase collaboration between communities of color, academic institutions and health serving organizations to make more efficient use of existing resources.",Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities,8894149,U54CA153506,"['Asian Americans ', ' Awareness ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Breast ', '

"Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Initiative ( 2 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal entitled the Chicago Southside Cancer Disparities Initiative (CSCDI) seeks support to form a partnership between the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC), a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and Chicago State University (CSU), a minority serving institution, to develop an infrastructure for cancer education, training and outreach. Abiding to the call for action to increase underrepresented minorities in the health care workforce as a mechanism to reduce disparities and advance research pertinent to the community, it is critical that we develop educational and academic pathways to increase knowledge transfer at the undergraduate and graduate levels. To this end, the CSCDI's objectives are to: 1) Create an Inter-University collaboration to develop, implement and evaluate cancer disparities curriculum to be integrated within selected CSU's current MPH curriculum as well as UC's Pritzker School of Medicine's (PSOM) curriculum. 2) Provide opportunities for community involvement through collaboratively developing and enhancing existing service learning sites(i.e. community organization) at both institutions; 3) Train MPH cohorts to engage service learning sites(i.e. community organization) in cancer prevention, health promotion and dissemination of cancer research; and 4) Expand education and training beyond the 4-year grant period by utilizing an NCI mechanism Cancer Education Program (R25E) or other federal agency collaborative research training grant There is a pressing need to improve cancer outcomes in Chicago. Specifically, UCCCC has been a leading institution for groundbreaking cancer research and technological advances. However, impact at the community level has been challenging and research dissemination into communities has been weak. CSU, an urban public University has had a long history of education, leadership and commitment to the Chicago's Southside. CSU has recently developed a new Master of Public Health (MPH) program to focus on minority health and health equity, providing an exciting opportunity for our partnership. However, despite CSU's strengths and reach, their research program and expertise in cancer disparities are tenuous, while cancer disparities on Chicago's Southside are on the rise. CSCDI, therefore, is an innovative and timely partnership that will bridge outstanding minority students and faculty together with nationally recognized educators and researchers in the field of cancer to increase the pool of minority public health professionals interested in studying cancer disparities.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer disparities among minority communities continue to grow. It is time to affect change by diversifying the health professional work force, a critical stp to the continued progress of cancer research, knowledge transfer and the understanding of cancer disparities among marginalized groups.  By providing education to a diverse public health workforce, we will improve dissemination, strengthen our reach and collaborate to affect change.",Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Initiative ( 2 of 2),8907397,P20CA165587,"['Affect ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mission ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' cohort ', ' cancer education ', ' Institution ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' M.P.H.

"Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Regional CNP located in Alameda County, California the home to one and a half million people and the most diverse county in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has large populations of Asian American (25%), Hispanic Americans (22%), African Americans (17%), and a decreasing Euro-American population (37%), and is the home of the largest group of Afghan refugees in the US. This county not only has diversity in its ethnic/racial composition but also a large population of persons who are uninsured or underinsured and of limited English proficiency. This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement.          At a time of reduced resources, low income populations who are uninsured and of limited English proficiency bear a disproportionate share of the burden of cancer. This CNP will provide the opportunity to increase collaboration between communities of color, academic institutions and health serving organizations to make more efficient use of existing

"Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC2) Center to Reduce Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Western New York (WNY) communities suffer from significant disparities in tobacco use and cessation practices, participation in research opportunities and rates of lung, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers. The proposed Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC) Center will address the most striking of these disparities and the burden of cancer in our region by focusing our efforts on minority and urban communities and clinical practices in the cities of Buffalo and Niagara Falls and rural Appalachian communities in neighboring Chautauqua County. We approach the reduction of disparities with clinical and community partnerships from a socio ecological model, with efforts to enhance social capital and reduce perceived racism. The goal of the Center is to ensure that all residents benefit from available clinical and scientific advances to reduce tobacco use, promote healthy lifestyles and behaviors, detect cancer early and participate in clinical and research programs in order to eliminate cancer inequities. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Enhance clinical environments by providing resources, training, outreach and interventions to improve the quality of clinical practice. Aim 2. Enhance outreach to the community by providing technical assistance and tailored outreach interventions to community organizations and partners to increase knowledge of, access to, and use of, beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures. Aim 3. Enhance CBPR training by provide training, mentoring, CBPR and trans-disciplinary research experiences and resources to prepare junior investigators and post-doctoral fellows. Aim 4. Conduct rigorous CBPR research by investigating variables and methods with our community partners to reduce cancer disparities. We propose a full ROI in collaboration with community PCP practices and patients to study the comparative effectiveness of practice enhancements to increase smoking cessation in African American and rural patients; and a pilot study with the Buffalo Latino community to study mechanisms to recruit participants to the cancer center biospecimen banking program. The WNYC^ Center also includes experienced leadership in an Administrative Core, multidimensional Outreach Program, and novel Training Program.          The proposed WNYC(2) Center is innovatively designed to reduce inequities in medically underserved populations in three counties in our region.

"CAUSES: Causes of Asian American mortality Understood by Socio-Economic Status  PROJECT SUMMARY Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States, with a population of over 14 million that is projected to reach nearly 34 million by 2050. However, our current understanding of Asian Americans is as an aggregated group, and very little is known about the six diverse Asian American racial/ethnic subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese), who have a wide range of disease risks, immigration histories, and socioeconomic status. There is currently a knowledge gap on the health of these expanding subpopulations, and there is no information to recommend research agendas, create public health policy, and offer clinical guidelines. Our current understanding of Asian American mortality patterns is distorted by the aggregation of distinct subgroups, the grouping of foreign-born and U.S.- born populations, and the unknown impact of sociodemographic factors. While the U.S. Census first started disaggregating Asian subgroups in 1980, disaggregation of Asian subgroups on U.S. death records occurred much later in 2003, and now over half of the 50 U.S. States disaggregate Asian subgroups. The goal of this study is to examine racial/ethnic, nativity, and geographic differences in Asian American subgroup mortality compared to other racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics). Investigation of cause-specific mortality in distinct subgroups, by nativity, and considering sociodemographic factors will be fundamental in assessing and addressing health disparities in Asian American communities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The current lack of national mortality statistics for Asian American subgroups makes it difficult to recommend research agendas, create public health policy, and offer clinical guidelines for diverse Asian American subgroups. The goal of this study is to examine racial/ethnic, nativity, and geographic disparities in Asian American subgroup mortality compared to other racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics).",CAUSES: Causes of Asian American mortality Understood by Socio-Economic Status,8607475,R01MD007012,"['Age ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death Records ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Heart ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Housing ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' County ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Attenuated ', ' Koreans ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' Coronary ', ' Hindu ', ' Asian Indian ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ']",NIMHD,PALO ALTO MEDICAL FOUNDATION RES INST,R01,2014,381488,0.07011385678788916

"NYU Center for the Study of Asian American Health The New York University (NYU) Center for the Study of Asian American Health (CSAAH) is a partnership of an academic medical and research center (NYU), several healthcare and public hospital organizations, and more than 55 community and government partners serving NYC's Asian American community. CSAAH's primary mission is to address, alleviate, and eliminate Asian American health disparities through a trans disciplinary and community-engaged research approach. To accomplish this mission, CSAAH is committed to the following guiding principles: 1) systemic change through the use of multiple strategies and working with diverse stakeholders; 2) equitable ""partnerships"" in research, training, and outreach; 3) action-oriented research; 4) strengthening research capacity of both community and academic partners to fully engage in the research process; and 5) conducting multicultural evaluation as a means to foster ownership, sustainability and impact. These guiding principles are integrated in each of CSAAH's four cores: 1)  Administrative, 2) Research, 3) Research Training and Education, and 4) Community Engagement and Outreach. The Specific Aims of the overall Center are to: a) develop and conduct research to understand, address, and eliminate health disparities in the Asian American community; b) build new and strengthen existing private and public partnerships in order to increase outreach, dissemination advocacy, and research capacity to address Asian American health disparities and social inequalities; and c) train a cadre of health and public health professionals on community-based approaches to conducting research, outreach, service delivery, and advocacy in the Asian American community. CSAAH has been organized into five research tracks: 1) Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes; 2) Tumorigenesis; 3) Mental Health; 4) Social and Cultural Determinants of Health; and 5) Pilot Project Research. There are two main research projects proposed for this application. The OASIS Project is focused on developing and implementing a culturally-appropriate faith-based intervention to reduce obesity and social stressors in South Asian communities.

"Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP) University of Washington (UW) and Black Hills Center for American Indian Health (BHCAIH) seek support for Native People for Cancer Control (NPCC), a currently-funded regional Community Networks Program (CNP). NPCC is organized into an Administrative Core and Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs. Directorship of NPCC will be shared by Dedra Buchwald, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director, Partnerships for Native Health, UW; and Jeffrey Henderson (Cheyenne River Sioux), MD, MPH, President and CEO of the community-based, non-profit BHCAIH in Rapid City, SD. NPCC serves an 8-state region and is headquartered at UW in Seattle, with 3 additional sites that align geographically with the conduct of our Community Outreach Program activities. Site 1 includes Washington, Alaska, and Oregon; Site 2 includes Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming; and Site 3 includes North and South Dakota. NPCC will include 15 American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) investigators, staff, and partners. AI/ANs have the poorest 5-year survival from all cancers combined among all U.S. racial/ethnic groups,(12) and access to cancer clinical trials is difficult. Our overarching aim, therefore, is to directly contribute to improved cancer health outcomes and quality of life for AI/AN populations, which experience dramatic health inequities. Our central strategy is to capitalize on opportunities and leverage existing resources to pursue an integrated, multifaceted research program that is catalyzed by tight partnerships with Native communities. We will address cancer health issues ranging from prevention and clinical trials to survivorship. Our long-term goal is to generate findings that can be translated into practices and policies that will reduce AI/AN cancer-related health disparities. Thus, our Specific Aims are to: 1) increase cancer education, outreach, health promotion, and prevention efforts among urban and rural AI/ANs through the activities of the Community Outreach Program; 2) conduct 1 Research Project, 2 CNP Pilot Projects, and 2 Training Projects using community-based participatory methods that focus on colorectal cancer screening, health literacy and communication, cancer risk factors and care, and clinical trials education among Al/ANs; 3) train at least 5 AI/AN junior faculty members to conduct research through the efforts of the Training Program; and 4) reduce cancer health disparities by increasing access to, and use of, interventions among AI/AN populations through all NPCC activities. These activities will be coordinated by the Administrative Core. With a wide network of partners, 25 funded cancer-related grants and 54 publications by NPCC-affiliated investigators, NPPC has the essential elements of a successful CNP, both as an individual site and as a member of the CNP network. Healthy People 2010 focuses on health disparities, yet progress reports revealed minimal improvement for Al/ANs in areas previously identified as problematic. For example, only 62% of AI/ANs had health insurance, virtually unchanged over the previous 4 years, and life expectancy for AI/ANs was up to 8 years shorter than for non-Al/ANs. Cancer morbidity, mortality, risk prevalence, and barriers to care remain major problems in Native communities. Concerted, coordinated, multidisciplinary efforts are needed to redress the striking cancer-related disparities experienced by this vulnerable population.",Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP),8735872,U54CA153498,"['Alaska ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Idaho ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Montana ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' North Dakota ', ' Oregon ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' South Dakota ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Wyoming ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Native Americans ', ' Community Networks ', ' Rivers ', ' programs ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' member ', ' sioux community ', ' Sioux ', ' Sioux Indians ', ' Prevention ', ' outreach program ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer education ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Health Communication ', ' Research Training ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Outreach Research ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U54,2014,235412,0.023863481788328166
"Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is now the leading cause of death in the state of North Carolina. In 2006, over 17,000 North Carolinians died from cancer. African Americans carry a disproportionate burden of cancer disease, with higher mortality rates than Caucasians from prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer. The Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) will leverage the myriad successes of CCN I and continue to promote the community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in adhering to the established mission of reducing cancer health disparities among adult African Americans in North Carolina. CCN II will be based at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will provide a three-pronged research infrastructure that includes: Outreach, Research, and Training. CCN II will continue to work with faith-based and secular community groups in two regional areas in North Carolina that comprise 13 urban and rural counties. CCN II program activities will be undertaken through the coordinating efforts of the Administrative Core, the partnership strengthening activities of the Community Outreach Program and the junior faculty development activities of the Training Program to form a comprehensive, interactive, community-academic research center.   Specifically, 1) the Administrative core will provide scientific leadership and direction to all three of CCN M's programs, cultivating cohesion and synergy to meet Center goals; 2) the Community Outreach Program will provide needs assessments, culturally sensitive cancer education, and targeted health promotion and dissemination efforts in concert with existing Community Partners; 3) the Training Program will identify, instruct and support the development of early-stage investigators interested in developing their own health disparities research programs using the CBPR approach; and 4) the Research Program will support the conduct of an evidence-based intervention study to increase colorectal cancer screening rates among African Americans using data generated from CCN I preliminary research and existing partnerships. Racial/ethnic minorities carry a greater burden of cancer than other population groups. Although there are many beneficial biomedical and behavioral services available for cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, many health disparities continue because these benefits are not shared by all.

"Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC)    DESCRIPTION: In response to RFA CA-09-032, the Center for Asian Health of Temple University proposes to establish a regional Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) to address the cancer burden and co-morbidities among underserved Asian American populations through community outreach, research, and training. The proposed Center builds upon the successful collaborations that were fostered during the previous ATECAR SPN and ATECAR CNP-I cycles and consists of academic institutions, community organizations, and community healthcare providers. The ACCHDC will work towards the overall goal of reducing cancer health disparities by increasing knowledge of, access to and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures in underserved Asian American communities. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to guide all Center activities, which fall within four components: the Administrative Core (AC), Community Outreach Program (COP), Research Program (RP) and Training Program (TP). The AC will provide essential administrative, scientific, programmatic, and community leadership and timely coordination of Center operations. The COP will focus on building cancer control capacity and increasing knowledge and access to cancer prevention among the multi-ethnic and multilingual Asian communities in the eastern region of the US (PA, NJ and NYC). Under the RP, a large-scale controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBPR colorectal cancer (CRC) intervention in increasing screening, knowledge of, perceived risks of and susceptibility to CRC and benefits of screening, as well as reducing health system barriers to screening. The pilot study, led by a junior investigator, will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate education intervention in increasing knowledge of and intent to participate in Hepatitis B biospecimen research and examining cultural factors associated with the participation in biospecimen research. The TP will develop and implement a comprehensive research training program in CBPR methods and provide mentorship and key resources to junior researchers from racial/ethnic minority and underrepresented groups. Center team members have forged successful collaborations during ATECAR SPN and CNP-I, have established strong partnerships with Asian communities and are dedicated to the Center's mission of reducing cancer health disparities in underserved Asian Americans.             The proposed ACCHDC program will make a significant contributions toward enhancing our understanding of, and increasing our capacity to reduce, cancer health disparities among Asian Americans.

"Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the United States. Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take part in cancer prevention and screening activities than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. The overall goal of this project is to work collaboratively with regional partners to reduce cancer disparities. It is the long-term goal of this proposed Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to reduce the cancer disparities experienced by Hispanics in the two regions selected for this project. Our short-term objectives are to:   1. Develop and enhance our existing relationships with community partners in Regions 1 and 2 to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos and members of the Yakama Nation (Administrative Core)   2. Increase health promotion outreach and cancer screening activities among Latinos and members of   the Yakama Nation (Outreach Core); 3. Increase cervical cancer screening among Latinas using a rigorous research project (Research Core); 4. Develop and assess the feasibility of a sustainable support system for cancer patients and survivors (research Core); and 5. Train junior investigators, especially underrepresented minorities, in grant writing and CBPR to reduce cancer disparities.    This proposed Community Networks Program (CNP) builds on our existing CNP (2005 - 2010). It proposes to add a randomized clinical trial to assess two different approaches to motivate cervical cancer screening. Further it adds a patient navigator approach to reduce time to follow-up of an abnormal pap test. The pilot project builds on existing community concerns. Through its outreach core, the proposed Center will spread information and support at the population level. The training core will help train a new generation of scientists in CBPR and scientific research. Through its four cores, the proposed Center will cover a myriad of cancer disparities and assist NCI in its endeavor to reduce such disparities.             Latinos are at high risk for specific types of cancer and have a higher mortality rate for other types of cancer.  In this project, we will increase cancer education and outreach to Latinos as well as conduct research to reduce their cancer disparities.

"Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECAD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECaD) at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center, St Louis, MO of Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital was established in 2003 with institutional funds in response to known excess cancer burden within the region particularly for minority and medically underserved populations. The Goals are to create a national model for eliminating disparities In cancer through community-based partnerships and community based participatory research (CBPR); to increase access by breaking down barriers to quality cancer care; and to be a catalyst for change in our region by fostering healthy communities. Given the fractured history of St Louis and its segregation, PECaD has worked with numerous community organizations and provider groups to build trust and has harnessed resources from non federal sources and NCI. We now propose to further strengthen partnerships in the St. Louis region and extend our activities to additional areas chosen based on poverty levels; limited access to cancer screening and prevention services; excess cancer incidence or mortality; and expressed community Interest In collaborative efforts to address cancer health disparities. Our three communities are St Louis City and North County, MO; St. Clair County, IL, and southeastern Missouri. The Specific aims are: 1. In collaboration with our community partners, using the community outreach program and working with our community partnerships, we will extend and evaluate the effectiveness of outreach. 2. In a research project created in partnership with our colorectal cancer community partnership, we will design and conduct a RCT of community awareness plus systems level changes to reinforce provider behavior change to order and follow-up on colorectal cancer screening tests. 3. In our pilot educational research project created with our prostate cancer community partnership, we will evaluate barriers and facilitators to participation in prostate CA tissue collection for research (biobanking). 4. Through our training program, provide CBPR training for researchers and community members collaborating with the program and institute an ongoing process for Identifying and vetting future pilot projects. 5.

"Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the United States. Data indicate that Hispanics are underserved and less likely to take part in cancer prevention and screening activities than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. The overall goal of this project is to work collaboratively with regional partners to reduce cancer disparities. It is the long-term goal of this proposed Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to reduce the cancer disparities experienced by Hispanics in the two regions selected for this project. Our short-term objectives are to:   1. Develop and enhance our existing relationships with community partners in Regions 1 and 2 to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos and members of the Yakama Nation (Administrative Core)   2. Increase health promotion outreach and cancer screening activities among Latinos and members of   the Yakama Nation (Outreach Core); 3. Increase cervical cancer screening among Latinas using a rigorous research project (Research Core); 4. Develop and assess the feasibility of a sustainable support system for cancer patients and survivors (research Core); and 5. Train junior investigators, especially underrepresented minorities, in grant writing and CBPR to reduce cancer disparities.    This proposed Community Networks Program (CNP) builds on our existing CNP (2005 - 2010). It proposes to add a randomized clinical trial to assess two different approaches to motivate cervical cancer screening. Further it adds a patient navigator approach to reduce time to follow-up of an abnormal pap test. The pilot project builds on existing community concerns. Through its outreach core, the proposed Center will spread information and support at the population level. The training core will help train a new generation of scientists in CBPR and scientific research. Through its four cores, the proposed Center will cover a myriad of cancer disparities and assist NCI in its endeavor to reduce such disparities. Latinos are at high risk for specific types of cancer and have a higher mortality rate for other types of cancer.  In this project, we will increase cancer education and outreach to Latinos as well as conduct research to reduce their cancer disparities. A training program is designed to increase the number of Latino researchers in cancer disparities.",Center for Hispanic Health Promotion: Reducing Cancer Disparities,9114192,U54CA153502,"['American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Incidence ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Societies ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Networks ', ' Staging ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' tribal reservation ', ' reservation community ', ' native american reservation ', ' nation reservation ', ' american indian reservation ', ' indian reservation ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' cancer education ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' minority health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,U54,2015,375357,0.03407845140498749
"Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP) University of Washington (UW) and Black Hills Center for American Indian Health (BHCAIH) seek support for Native People for Cancer Control (NPCC), a currently-funded regional Community Networks Program (CNP). NPCC is organized into an Administrative Core and Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs. Directorship of NPCC will be shared by Dedra Buchwald, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director, Partnerships for Native Health, UW; and Jeffrey Henderson (Cheyenne River Sioux), MD, MPH, President and CEO of the community-based, non-profit BHCAIH in Rapid City, SD. NPCC serves an 8-state region and is headquartered at UW in Seattle, with 3 additional sites that align geographically with the conduct of our Community Outreach Program activities. Site 1 includes Washington, Alaska, and Oregon; Site 2 includes Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming; and Site 3 includes North and South Dakota. NPCC will include 15 American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) investigators, staff, and partners. AI/ANs have the poorest 5-year survival from all cancers combined among all U.S. racial/ethnic groups,(12) and access to cancer clinical trials is difficult. Our overarching aim, therefore, is to directly contribute to improved cancer health outcomes and quality of life for AI/AN populations, which experience dramatic health inequities. Our central strategy is to capitalize on opportunities and leverage existing resources to pursue an integrated, multifaceted research program that is catalyzed by tight partnerships with Native communities. We will address cancer health issues ranging from prevention and clinical trials to survivorship. Our long-term goal is to generate findings that can be translated into practices and policies that will reduce AI/AN cancer-related health disparities. Thus, our Specific Aims are to: 1) increase cancer education, outreach, health promotion, and prevention efforts among urban and rural AI/ANs through the activities of the Community Outreach Program; 2) conduct 1 Research Project, 2 CNP Pilot Projects, and 2 Training Projects using community-based participatory methods that focus on colorectal cancer screening, health literacy and communication, cancer risk factors and care, and clinical trials education among Al/ANs; 3) train at least 5 AI/AN junior faculty members to conduct research through the efforts of the Training Program; and 4) reduce cancer health disparities by increasing access to, and use of, interventions among AI/AN populations through all NPCC activities. These activities will be coordinated by the Administrative Core. With a wide network of partners, 25 funded cancer-related grants and 54 publications by NPCC-affiliated investigators, NPPC has the essential elements of a successful CNP, both as an individual site and as a member of the CNP network. Healthy People 2010 focuses on health disparities, yet progress reports revealed minimal improvement for Al/ANs in areas previously identified as problematic. For example, only 62% of AI/ANs had health insurance, virtually unchanged over the previous 4 years, and life expectancy for AI/ANs was up to 8 years shorter than for non-Al/ANs. Cancer morbidity, mortality, risk prevalence, and barriers to care remain major problems in Native communities. Concerted, coordinated, multidisciplinary efforts are needed to redress the striking cancer-related disparities experienced by this vulnerable population.",Regional Native American Community Networks Program (RNACNP),9113880,U54CA153498,"['Alaska ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Idaho ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Montana ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' North Dakota ', ' Oregon ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' South Dakota ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Wyoming ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Native Americans ', ' Community Networks ', ' Rivers ', ' programs ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' member ', ' sioux community ', ' Sioux ', ' Sioux Indians ', ' Prevention ', ' outreach program ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer education ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Health Communication ', ' Research Training ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Outreach Research ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U54,2015,265402,0.023863481788328166
"Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECAD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Program for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECaD) at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center, St Louis, MO of Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital was established in 2003 with institutional funds in response to known excess cancer burden within the region particularly for minority and medically underserved populations. The Goals are to create a national model for eliminating disparities In cancer through community-based partnerships and community based participatory research (CBPR); to increase access by breaking down barriers to quality cancer care; and to be a catalyst for change in our region by fostering healthy communities. Given the fractured history of St Louis and its segregation, PECaD has worked with numerous community organizations and provider groups to build trust and has harnessed resources from non federal sources and NCI. We now propose to further strengthen partnerships in the St. Louis region and extend our activities to additional areas chosen based on poverty levels; limited access to cancer screening and prevention services; excess cancer incidence or mortality; and expressed community Interest In collaborative efforts to address cancer health disparities. Our three communities are St Louis City and North County, MO; St. Clair County, IL, and southeastern Missouri. The Specific aims are: 1. In collaboration with our community partners, using the community outreach program and working with our community partnerships, we will extend and evaluate the effectiveness of outreach. 2. In a research project created in partnership with our colorectal cancer community partnership, we will design and conduct a RCT of community awareness plus systems level changes to reinforce provider behavior change to order and follow-up on colorectal cancer screening tests. 3. In our pilot educational research project created with our prostate cancer community partnership, we will evaluate barriers and facilitators to participation in prostate CA tissue collection for research (biobanking). 4. Through our training program, provide CBPR training for researchers and community members collaborating with the program and institute an ongoing process for Identifying and vetting future pilot projects. 5. In conjunction with our community Disparities Elimination Advisory Committee (DEAC), we will develop a framework for evaluation within and across our Community Outreach, Research, and Training Programs. Excess cancer mortality In low income, minority and underserved populations will be addressed through community based participatory research projects that bring prevention information and access to 3 high risk populations.

"Alameda County Network Program for Reducing Cancer Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a Regional CNP located in Alameda County, California the home to one and a half million people and the most diverse county in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has large populations of Asian American (25%), Hispanic Americans (22%), African Americans (17%), and a decreasing Euro-American population (37%), and is the home of the largest group of Afghan refugees in the US. This county not only has diversity in its ethnic/racial composition but also a large population of persons who are uninsured or underinsured and of limited English proficiency. This is a population that is not reached through medical service settings. Therefore, we propose to reach them through their diverse faith communities. Aims: Using CBPR methods: 1) Develop and implement an Outreach Program based on updating assets/needs of the community through socio-demographic and health assessments, existing resources. 2) Conduct a full research project and pilot project (as a training tool). 3) Develop a Training Program to develop a cadre of community researchers using CBPR methods. Methods: 1) We will conduct an assets/needs assessment working with the community members through diverse faith communities by using existing data from the census, cancer registry, county surveys and will collect information on community resources (both educational materials and services) and will coordinate our efforts with the NCI. Using CBPR methods, we will involve community in deciding the directions for the Outreach Program. Two new programs are envisioned: Church socials & other events that focus on family history and the importance of biospecimen collection/clinical trials, and a faith based colorectal screening program to reduce the burden of cancer. 2) The Full Research proposed focuses on issues of literacy, low language proficiency, and cultural/religious issues in breast health among Afghan refugee women while the pilot focuses on use of churches for recruiting African American women and training them in advocacy skills to better navigate the health care system. 3) Our faculty for training are experienced in teaching about disparities at both the population and service level, CBPR, and grants writing. We are also experienced mentoring young researchers to become skilled in developing independent programs of CBPR research. Outcomes: Finally, both process and outcome evaluation will be used for all of the programs to improve them and to meet productivity benchmarks consistent with academic achievement. At a time of reduced resources, low income populations who are uninsured and of limited English proficiency bear a disproportionate share of the burden of cancer. This CNP will provide the opportunity to increase collaboration between communities of color, academic institutions and health serving organizations to make more efficient use of existing

"CBPR:  Enhancing Capacity to Use Innovative Methodologies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for the use of innovative methodologies in the behavioral and social sciences has been widely noted. The past two decades have seen continued recognition that more innovative and community-engaged approaches to research and interventions are needed to address the social and environmental determinants of population health and more specifically racial and ethnic inequities in health. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is one such approach to community-engaged research. Increased funding support for CBPR is in keeping with the mission statement of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the research capacity- building priorities delineated in the NIH Health Disparities Strategic Plan 2009-2013, and select research goals of the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR). As the need for and opportunities to expand CBPR increases, so does the need to enhance capacity in innovative methods for researchers conducting behavioral and social sciences research (BSSR) to use this approach. Not only is CBPR an innovative approach in and of itself for many researchers conducting BSSR, there are also several specific innovations within the context of a CBPR approach that are particularly relevant to the mission of NIH. These innovative methods include the integrated use of mixed methods (combining qualitative and quantitative methods), and innovative research designs that complement randomized controlled designs. Although numerous educational materials on CBPR have been developed in recent years, there are few opportunities for both early-career and established researchers to engage in a co-learning process facilitated by experienced academic-community faculty teams. Further, there is a need to promote the diversity of the BSSR workforce, including increasing participation of researchers from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Thus, the overarching goal of the proposed research education program, Community-Based Participatory Research: Enhancing Capacity to Use Innovative Methodologies in the Behavioral and Social Sciences (the Enhance Program), is to enhance knowledge and skills in the use of innovative methodologies in CBPR, in partnership with the communities involved, to examine and address health inequities. The proposed Enhance Program will be carried out by the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center (Detroit URC), a CBPR partnership established in 1995 to understand and address factors that contribute to health inequities in Detroit. The two- pronged approach of the Enhance Program is: 1) to develop, implement, and evaluate an intensive short course in innovative methodologies in CBPR for conducting behavioral and social sciences research; and 2) to enhance and integrate learning from the short course through a series of follow-on educational activities, an applied CBPR project, mentoring, and development of a network of diverse scholars for career development and innovation in BSSR using a CBPR approach to promote health equity. An evaluation will be conducted to assess and enhance program effectiveness. The curriculum and other materials will be widely disseminated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To solve complex public health problems, community-based participatory research (CBPR), a collaborative, participatory approach between academic and community partners is particularly effective. CBPR is an innovative approach for researchers conducting behavioral and social sciences research and numerous innovative methods are relevant within this approach.

"Community Networks Program: The Johns Hopkins Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under the direction of its community partners within Baltimore City and Prince George's County, the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center proposes to formally establish the ""Community Networks Program (CNP): The Johns Hopkins Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities."" The proposed Center arises from an established community-academic practice partnership that has been active across the two counties, in delivery of cancer screening services, and in research. These predominantly African American counties differ in socio economic status, but both experience disproportionate mortality due to breast, cervix and colorectal cancer. The objective of this proposal is to create an infrastructure to support community-driven research that creates training opportunities for early-stage investigators. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To establish an Administrative Core to provide leadership for the Center's overall strategic planning, including scientific leader-ship-and-oversight-on using-the-GBPR approach and its core-principles; 2) To develop a Community- Outreach Program that leverages existing community outreach initiatives targeted to multiethnic underserved populations in Baltimore City and Prince George's County; 3) To implement a Research Program consisting of two projects: a) the Full Research Project, ""Evaluating Coaches of Older Adults for Cancer Care and Healthy Behaviors (COACH)"", a randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of trained, participant designated coaches vs. professionally-based navigators, in supporting adherence to cancer screening; and b) the Pilot Educational Research Project, a mixed-methods study that examines knowledge, attitudes and willingness of multiethnic older adults to participate in a cancer-related biospecimen repository; 4) To establish a Training Program with the primary goal of increasing the number of qualified health disparity researchers experienced in using CBPR in the context of cancer disparities. The CNP Center at Johns Hopkins will create a sustainable infrastructure for community based participatory research on a large, multiple project, highly collaborative scale, It will increase knowledge of, access to, and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures related to cancer in areas ranging from prevention to early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.

"INTER-CAMBIO: Community-Academic Meetings to Bridge Initiatives in Obesity     DESCRIPTION: Obesity has been described as a national epidemic and is associated with a number of negative health outcomes, including higher rates of chronic disease (e.g., heart disease, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers), elevated health-care costs, decreased quality of life, and greater risk of premature death. Hispanics are disproportionally affected by obesity, having a 21% greater risk of being obese compared to non-Hispanic whites. One way to address obesity-related health disparities is through the creation of meaningful partnerships between academic institutions and community-based health organizations using an approach called community based participatory research (CBPR). OBJECTIVE: To establish a CBPR partnership between Northwestern University (NU) clinicians and researchers and the Chicago Hispanic Health Coalition (CHHC), a group of over 600 local health and social service agencies and community based organizations whose mission is to promote healthy behavior and prevent chronic disease and health disparities in the Hispanic communities of metropolitan Chicago. This partnership will jointly address racial health disparities among the Hispanic community as it relates to chronic stress and related cultural and environmental factors in the context of increasing engagement in obesity prevention and health promotion behaviors. STUDY DESIGN: We will form a collaborative research alliance, participate in capacity building, learning and professional development, and engage the Hispanic community through outreach and education. In Year 1, we will develop an advisory board, convene a community kickoff meeting, form a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between NU and CHHC, and host community forums for dissemination and outreach. In year 2 we will continue to have quarterly advisory board meetings and community forums. We will also develop an MOU with a second community based organization, Salud Latina. In year 3 we will continue quarterly advisory board meetings and community forums. We will also write and submit a grant proposal to build capacity within our developing alliance, enhance networks and infrastructure that will promote community-engaged research that not only takes place in the community, but involves the community; and foster preliminary work in health promotion and obesity prevention in the Hispanic community. RELEVANCE: This work will advance understanding and community-academic aligned strategies and action plans to prevent and reduce obesity among the Hispanic community through better understanding the role of chronic stress.

"Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Initiative ( 2 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal entitled the Chicago Southside Cancer Disparities Initiative (CSCDI) seeks support to form a partnership between the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC), a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and Chicago State University (CSU), a minority serving institution, to develop an infrastructure for cancer education, training and outreach. Abiding to the call for action to increase underrepresented minorities in the health care workforce as a mechanism to reduce disparities and advance research pertinent to the community, it is critical that we develop educational and academic pathways to increase knowledge transfer at the undergraduate and graduate levels. To this end, the CSCDI's objectives are to: 1) Create an Inter-University collaboration to develop, implement and evaluate cancer disparities curriculum to be integrated within selected CSU's current MPH curriculum as well as UC's Pritzker School of Medicine's (PSOM) curriculum. 2) Provide opportunities for community involvement through collaboratively developing and enhancing existing service learning sites(i.e. community organization) at both institutions; 3) Train MPH cohorts to engage service learning sites(i.e. community organization) in cancer prevention, health promotion and dissemination of cancer research; and 4) Expand education and training beyond the 4-year grant period by utilizing an NCI mechanism Cancer Education Program (R25E) or other federal agency collaborative research training grant There is a pressing need to improve cancer outcomes in Chicago. Specifically, UCCCC has been a leading institution for groundbreaking cancer research and technological advances. However, impact at the community level has been challenging and research dissemination into communities has been weak. CSU, an urban public University has had a long history of education, leadership and commitment to the Chicago's Southside. CSU has recently developed a new Master of Public Health (MPH) program to focus on minority health and health equity, providing an exciting opportunity for our partnership. However, despite CSU's strengths and reach, their research program and expertise in cancer disparities are tenuous, while cancer disparities on Chicago's Southside are on the rise. CSCDI, therefore, is an innovative and timely partnership that will bridge outstanding minority students and faculty together with nationally recognized educators and researchers in the field of cancer to increase the pool of minority public health professionals interested in studying cancer disparities.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer disparities among minority communities continue to grow. It is time to affect change by diversifying the health professional work force, a critical stp to the continued progress of cancer research, knowledge transfer and the understanding of cancer disparities among marginalized groups.  By providing education to a diverse public health workforce, we will improve dissemination, strengthen our reach and collaborate to affect change.",Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Initiative ( 2 of 2),8918526,P20CA165587,"['Affect ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mission ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' cohort ', ' cancer education ', ' Institution ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' M.P.H.

"South Carolina Cancer Health Equity Consortium (SC CHEC): Summer Undergraduate Research Training Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), the University of South Carolina (USC), and three historically black colleges/universities - Claflin University (CU), South Carolina State University (SCSU), and Voorhees College (VC) - have joined forces under the larger aegis of the South Carolina Cancer Health Equity Consortium (SC CHEC) to develop this application for an R25E NIH/NCI Cancer Education Grants Program. Together, these institutions have created an innovative, inter-institutional, 14-week summer course. This is combined with a hands-on laboratory research training platform and career mentoring by some of the nation's leading cancer researchers to attract and catalyze a new generation of diverse biomedical scientists. Within this new five-year initiative, 80 undergraduate juniors and seniors (designated as SC CHEC Student Fellows) from USC, CU, SCSU, and VC will engage with investigators at the MUSC Hollings Cancer Center, a National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated cancer center, to expose them to the latest advances in biomedical research spanning basic, clinical, and population sciences with an emphasis on cancer disparity dynamics in South Carolina (SC). The curriculum and training of this new initiative are focused on four of the most disparate cancers in terms of incidence, morbidity, and mortality in SC - breast, prostate, head/neck, and cervical cancer. Health outcomes for patients diagnosed with these four cancers are strongly influenced by race, ethnicity, urban/rural residence, socioeconomic position, and potentially biology. This R25E program's primary strategy will employ in-person classroom and laboratory instruction within the context of contemporary scientific approaches to cancer research at MUSC. These will be complemented by selected clinical and biotechnology-focused rotations, community engagement, and Graduate Record Examination preparation. The SC CHEC leadership strongly believes that promoting interest, career development, and commitment from the Millennial Generation (those born in the 1990s) to cancer biomedical and biobehavioral research is a critical step to attaining health equity and improved health outcomes in SC and beyond.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The R25E Program combines an innovative, inter-institutional, 14-week, summer course with hands-on laboratory research training and career mentoring by some of the nation's leading cancer researchers to attract and catalyze a new generation of diverse biomedical scientists.

"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network -- II DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina Cancer Disparities Community Network N's overarching goal is to contribute materially to: understanding the underlying causes of cancer-related health disparities; discovering and developing effective innovations to lower incidence, improving survival, and reducing suffering; delivering these innovations to high-risk populations and moving them to widespread dissemination. We focus on African Americans (AAs) in South Carolina, a group in a region with much higher-than-average cancer incidence and extraordinarily high mortality given incidence. Our goal will be realized by achieving these Specific Aims: 1. to increase the knowledge base needed to understand which biomedical and behavioral procedures are most likely to prevent and control cancer in the high-risk African-American communities in South Carolina; 2. to develop and test interventions that are likely to reduce cancer incidence, downstage disease at time of diagnosis, increase longevity, and improve quality of life in people with cancer; 3. To deliver interventions shown to be effective to places of greatest receptivity and public health need and to evaluate them in terms of generalizability (i.e., external validity); and 4. To disseminate results from successful interventions in the form of intervention ""packages"" within our communities in South Carolina and to work with national partners to determine and distinguish universal elements that will work most (or at least many) places and others that are more place- and culture-specific. The success of SCCDCN-ll is predicated on: strong community support; dedication to the principles of community-based participatory research; understanding that the philosophical underpinnings and practical methods of applying knowledge are essentially the same across interdisciplinary, translational and community-based participatory research; that the tripartite missions of research, education, and service are both inseparable and highly interdependent; and that training of the next generation of scientists dedicated to the highest ideals of community-based participatory, interdisciplinary, and translational research is necessary in order to reduce, and then finally eliminate cancer-related health disparities. The SCCDCN-ll builds on work begun in CNP-I that allows us to expand programming to reduce, and finally eliminate entirely, cancer-related health disparities.

"Deep South Network for Cancer Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Deep South Network for Cancer Control (DSNCC) focuses on some of the most impoverished and underserved areas in the US. The rural MS Delta, AL Black Belt and inner city of Birmingham, AL and Hattiesburg, Laurel, MS have exceptionally high rates of cancer mortality, cancer disparity and obesity. The DSNCC has for 9 yrs systematically addressed the major cancer health concerns of these areas. A community based infrastructure was established that in collaboration with three academic institutions addressed disparity in cervical and breast cancer screening and more recently in colorectal cancer screening, lack of physical activity and unhealthy eating. During this period we have expanded our community infrastructure in our targeted areas to include a Community Network Partnership (CNP) in each county. Building upon our community-academic partnership, our success in promoting cancer screening, increasing physical activity and incorporating healthy eating into churches, we have the following overall Specific Aims: 1-Through the Community Outreach Core, promote screening for breast, cervix, and colorectal cancer and increased physical activity and healthy eating through a community based participatory approach that includes development of a Community Action Plan that targets all levels of the socio-ecological model; 2-   through the Research Core develop, implement, and evaluate the efficacy of a community-based,   participatory, culturally-relevant intervention to reduce body weight among African American women residing in rural communities in the Deep South through a group randomized trial. Also, develop, implement, and disseminate the results of 3 pilot projects that address the needs of the community as well as the NCI requirements, with the first having a primary focus of addressing the need of revisiting the current colorectal cancer screening guidelines for African Americans; 3-through the Training Core train a cadre of new investigators who are committed to community based participatory research (CBPR) to eliminate cancer health disparities. The activities of these cores will be coordinated by an Administrative Core. This is a highly relevant project that addresses an African-American population in a geographic location that suffers disproportionately from cancer, obesity and related co-morbidities.

"Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is now the leading cause of death in the state of North Carolina. In 2006, over 17,000 North Carolinians died from cancer. African Americans carry a disproportionate burden of cancer disease, with higher mortality rates than Caucasians from prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer. The Carolina Community Network Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CCN II) will leverage the myriad successes of CCN I and continue to promote the community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in adhering to the established mission of reducing cancer health disparities among adult African Americans in North Carolina. CCN II will be based at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will provide a three-pronged research infrastructure that includes: Outreach, Research, and Training. CCN II will continue to work with faith-based and secular community groups in two regional areas in North Carolina that comprise 13 urban and rural counties. CCN II program activities will be undertaken through the coordinating efforts of the Administrative Core, the partnership strengthening activities of the Community Outreach Program and the junior faculty development activities of the Training Program to form a comprehensive, interactive, community-academic research center.   Specifically, 1) the Administrative core will provide scientific leadership and direction to all three of CCN M's programs, cultivating cohesion and synergy to meet Center goals; 2) the Community Outreach Program will provide needs assessments, culturally sensitive cancer education, and targeted health promotion and dissemination efforts in concert with existing Community Partners; 3) the Training Program will identify, instruct and support the development of early-stage investigators interested in developing their own health disparities research programs using the CBPR approach; and 4) the Research Program will support the conduct of an evidence-based intervention study to increase colorectal cancer screening rates among African Americans using data generated from CCN I preliminary research and existing partnerships. Racial/ethnic minorities carry a greater burden of cancer than other population groups. Although there are many beneficial biomedical and behavioral services available for cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, many health disparities continue because these benefits are not shared by all.

"Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) DESCRIPTION: In response to RFA CA-09-032, the Center for Asian Health of Temple University proposes to establish a regional Asian Community Cancer Health Disparities Center (ACCHDC) to address the cancer burden and co-morbidities among underserved Asian American populations through community outreach, research, and training. The proposed Center builds upon the successful collaborations that were fostered during the previous ATECAR SPN and ATECAR CNP-I cycles and consists of academic institutions, community organizations, and community healthcare providers. The ACCHDC will work towards the overall goal of reducing cancer health disparities by increasing knowledge of, access to and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures in underserved Asian American communities. This goal will be accomplished using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles to guide all Center activities, which fall within four components: the Administrative Core (AC), Community Outreach Program (COP), Research Program (RP) and Training Program (TP). The AC will provide essential administrative, scientific, programmatic, and community leadership and timely coordination of Center operations. The COP will focus on building cancer control capacity and increasing knowledge and access to cancer prevention among the multi-ethnic and multilingual Asian communities in the eastern region of the US (PA, NJ and NYC). Under the RP, a large-scale controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBPR colorectal cancer (CRC) intervention in increasing screening, knowledge of, perceived risks of and susceptibility to CRC and benefits of screening, as well as reducing health system barriers to screening. The pilot study, led by a junior investigator, will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate education intervention in increasing knowledge of and intent to participate in Hepatitis B biospecimen research and examining cultural factors associated with the participation in biospecimen research. The TP will develop and implement a comprehensive research training program in CBPR methods and provide mentorship and key resources to junior researchers from racial/ethnic minority and underrepresented groups. Center team members have forged successful collaborations during ATECAR SPN and CNP-I, have established strong partnerships with Asian communities and are dedicated to the Center's mission of reducing cancer health disparities in underserved Asian Americans. The proposed ACCHDC program will make a significant contributions toward enhancing our understanding of, and increasing our capacity to reduce, cancer health disparities among Asian Americans.

"1/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Individuals from underserved minority communities in the U.S. experience poor outcomes for the majority of cancers as a result of inequities in access to high quality healthcare, socio-cultural and environmental determinants, and in some cases behavioral and biologic factors. Inequities in cancer outcomes are rooted in a wide range of structural, socio-cultural, and policy-related determinants that are operative throughout the U.S., but local factors can perpetuate and influence the magnitude of disparate cancer outcomes. To some extent, high cancer mortality among racial and ethnic minority segments of the population is a national manifestation of a wide range of local problems. A promising strategy to address cancer disparities is to foster research to understand local patterns of cancer mortality and root causes of disparities, and to test interventions informed by those findings that account for the needs of the local community. This paradigm for addressing cancer disparities has been successfully employed by a large cadre of cancer researchers at the University of Illinois Cancer Center (UICC) for more than a decade and forms the basis of the UICC vision to be a “bench- to-community” NCI-designated cancer center. Governors State University (GSU) has invested substantially in basic science and health science infrastructure, increased efforts to recruit faculty members with an interest in research, and significantly enhanced research support services over the past several years. As a result, GSU is positioned to address growing cancer disparities in their community. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop additional infrastructure that will build on the strengths of the partnering institutions in order to enhance their capacity to conduct cancer health inequities research that is driven by local data and informed by the cancer-related needs of local communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE (OVERALL): The GUIDE (GSU-UICC-Disparities-Education) Cancer Research Training Project is a collaborative initiative between GSU and UICC. The institutions will jointly conduct a pilot research project addressing a local, cancer-related health disparity and will develop a training program for GSU junior faculty and undergraduate students designed to attract and prepare investigators for careers in cancer disparities.",1/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project,9037457,P20CA202908,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Peer Review ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' science education ', ' member ', ' Funding Source ', ' Funding Agency ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Localized Malignancy ', ' Localized Cancer ', ' Local Cancer ', ' Localized Malignant Neoplasm ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' UICC ', ' International Union Against Cancer ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' R21 Award ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,P20,2015,224145,-0.012545005370573833
"1/2 Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: An SCC-SIUSM Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Low-income rural communities experience significant cancer health disparities, including lower screening rates, increased incidence, and later stage at detection, poorer survival, and higher mortality. The Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSM) and its Simmons Cancer Institute serve much of the central rural, southern rural, and Delta regions of Illinois. These rural communities have higher poverty rates and are medically underserved with disparately high cancer burden. SIUSM has established a partnership with the NCI-designated Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) at Washington University in Saint Louis (WUSTL), and SCC's Prevention and Control Program, entitled, Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: An SCC-SIUSM PARTNERSHIP. To prepare for this application, we initiated planning activities in summer 2013. These collaborative planning activities included shared discussions, bi-monthly executive conference calls, in-person meetings at both sites, and early collaborative research efforts between SCC and SIUSM investigators. An Internal Advisory Committee comprised of representatives from each institution and key stakeholders from the region was formed and active in planning this application. The partnership goals are to: 1) build SIUSM cancer research capacity and support SIUSM faculty in transitioning to NIH-funded cancer disparities research, 2) provide opportunities for mid- and senior-level investigators to engage in cross- institutional cancer research and increase the rural cancer research scope and capacity at SCC, and 3) foster the development of post- doctoral scholars and junior faculty at both institutions to develop independent researchers in cancer disparities research. We will use three strategies to achieve these goals: First, a newly developed Pilot Research Program now allows junior investigators to gain research seed funding, collaborative experience and preliminary data for future NIH grants. This growing program prompted by this NCI PAR has already funded one on-going collaborative pilot, and another pilot is included in this application. Second, SCC will provide SIUSM faculty and trainees with access to research seminars and other training opportunities at SCC, and offer short-term investigator exchange programs. Third, building on career development activities ongoing at SCC, the two institutions will share strategies for faculty early career development. In particular, WUSTL's Division of Public Health Sciences offers a 10-month Master's degree in Population Health Science. We will identify clinician-scientists at SIUSM who want to build these research skills through coursework. We envision that these training activities may grow into an R25E or T32 application for rural cancer disparities research. Building on and leveraging the world-class cancer research and training programs at SCC and its Division of Public Health Science, and the rurally-focused mission of SIUSM and its commitment to develop population health science research, this Partnership will provide an important avenue for training and supporting a cadre of basic, clinical and population-based scientists at SIUSM with a focus on alleviating rural cancer disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative (Overall) The overall goal is to establish a highly integrated research and training collaboration focused on rural cancer health disparities between Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSM), an institution that serves the population of Downstate Illinois, a largely rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged region with significant cancer health disparities, and the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University in St. Louis (SCC- WUSTL), an NCI-designated Cancer Center. The Partnership will build SIUSM's research capacity and success conducting NIH-funded cancer disparity research, while also enhancing SCC's rural cancer awareness, research and reach. By doing so, the Partnership will contribute to reducing the cancer health disparities that persist in rural populations.        OVERALL CRITIQUES        ",1/2 Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: An SCC-SIUSM Partnership,9036814,P20CA192987,"['Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Mississippi ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Seeds ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' falls ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Rural Community ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Saints ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Rivers ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Training and Education ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' career development ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', "" Master's Degree "", ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' investigator training ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY SCH OF MED,P20,2015,224852,-0.021026175122382623

"Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Initiative ( 2 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal entitled the Chicago Southside Cancer Disparities Initiative (CSCDI) seeks support to form a partnership between the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC), a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and Chicago State University (CSU), a minority serving institution, to develop an infrastructure for cancer education, training and outreach. Abiding to the call for action to increase underrepresented minorities in the health care workforce as a mechanism to reduce disparities and advance research pertinent to the community, it is critical that we develop educational and academic pathways to increase knowledge transfer at the undergraduate and graduate levels. To this end, the CSCDI's objectives are to: 1) Create an Inter-University collaboration to develop, implement and evaluate cancer disparities curriculum to be integrated within selected CSU's current MPH curriculum as well as UC's Pritzker School of Medicine's (PSOM) curriculum. 2) Provide opportunities for community involvement through collaboratively developing and enhancing existing service learning sites(i.e. community organization) at both institutions; 3) Train MPH cohorts to engage service learning sites(i.e. community organization) in cancer prevention, health promotion and dissemination of cancer research; and 4) Expand education and training beyond the 4-year grant period by utilizing an NCI mechanism Cancer Education Program (R25E) or other federal agency collaborative research training grant There is a pressing need to improve cancer outcomes in Chicago. Specifically, UCCCC has been a leading institution for groundbreaking cancer research and technological advances. However, impact at the community level has been challenging and research dissemination into communities has been weak. CSU, an urban public University has had a long history of education, leadership and commitment to the Chicago's Southside. CSU has recently developed a new Master of Public Health (MPH) program to focus on minority health and health equity, providing an exciting opportunity for our partnership. However, despite CSU's strengths and reach, their research program and expertise in cancer disparities are tenuous, while cancer disparities on Chicago's Southside are on the rise. CSCDI, therefore, is an innovative and timely partnership that will bridge outstanding minority students and faculty together with nationally recognized educators and researchers in the field of cancer to increase the pool of minority public health professionals interested in studying cancer disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer disparities among minority communities continue to grow. It is time to affect change by diversifying the health professional work force, a critical stp to the continued progress of cancer research, knowledge transfer and the understanding of cancer disparities among marginalized groups.

"2/2, University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry is a highly underserved minority with a significant, disparate burden of cancer. In addition, they are also highly underrepresented among cancer researchers and cancer health care professionals. The University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) have been engaged in a unique and successful partnership over the past twelve years, currently supported by a U54 grant. As the only U54 Partnership addressing cancer health disparities in Pacific Islanders, the UOG/UHCC Partnership is characterized by a significant number of very distinctive aspects and opportunities. In particular, 37% of the Guam population is represented by indigenous Chamorros/part-Chamorros, while 38% are Filipino and Micronesian. The unique ethnic characteristics of this UOG/UHCC Partnership are paralleled by its unique geographic characteristics (the region covered by HI, GU, and U.S. Pacific Territories/jurisdictions), as well as unique regional opportunities for research, education, and outreach. The UOG/UHCC Partnership has indeed been transformational for the UOG and the Territory of Guam as specified in UOG's Letter of Commitment, including the establishment of a Cancer Research Center at UOG and implementation of legislation markedly increasing taxes on tobacco products. At UHCC the U54 has resulted in increased cancer health disparities research in Pacific Islanders. In this U54 renewal application, our overarching goal is to establish our Partner- ship as the national and international leader in advancing cancer health equity in Pacific Islanders. To achieve this goal we will build upon the success of the last five and a half years. All Specific Aims of the individual components of our application support our overall objectives, namely 1) to continue to develop the cancer re- search capability and competitiveness of faculty at UOG by increasing the number of UOG faculty with investigator-initiated funding and peer-reviewed publications; 2) to further develop the focus of UHCC research on cancer health disparities, with particular emphasis on Pacific Islanders and related topics of regional relevance such as betel nut chewing and cervical cancer screening and prevention; 3) To continue raising the awareness of cancer and cancer prevention in the multiethnic communities served by UOG and UHCC, with emphasis on Pacific Islanders; and 4) to increase the number of cancer and biomedical science researchers of Pacific Is- lander ancestry in the U.S. by continuing our successful MA, MS, and PhD training programs for Pacific Is- lander students in cancer-related fields, as well as providing guidance to early stage faculty investigators. The leadership at UOG and UHCC are highly committed to this Partnership as evidenced by their strong Letters of Support and the commitment of significant resources to the Partnership.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This grant has supported the only cancer research infrastructure established west of Hawaii, in the U.S. Territory of Guam. Continued funding will support three research projects described herein, focusing on cancers of regional significance. The partnership provides opportunities for faculty as well as pre-doctoral and post-doctoral students to develop and strengthen skills in project design and administration, team collaboration, recruitment and retention, specimen collection, data analysis, manuscript writing, grantsmanship among others. Early stage and senior investigators at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center will gain opportunities to work with new populations in the Hawaii-Pacific region, including Chamorros, Chuukese and Marshallese, and establish collaborations with UOG faculty who share interests in cancer health disparities research.        OVERALL CRITIQUES        ","2/2, University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership",9043965,U54CA143728,"['Award ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Hawaii ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' chews ', ' chewed ', ' Chewing ', ' Mastication ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Nuts ', ' Pacific Islands ', ' Peer Review ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Ships ', ' Students ', ' Taxes ', ' Tobacco ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' career ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Staging ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' skills ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Indigenous ', ' International ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' CRCH ', ' Cancer Research Center of Hawaii ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Outreach Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Characteristics ', ' Shipping ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' doctoral student ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF GUAM,U54,2015,810686,-0.004190922390270139
"2/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Individuals from underserved minority communities in the U.S. experience poor outcomes for the majority of cancers as a result of inequities in access to high quality healthcare, socio-cultural and environmental determinants, and in some cases behavioral and biologic factors. Inequities in cancer outcomes are rooted in a wide range of structural, socio-cultural, and policy-related determinants that are operative throughout the U.S., but local factors can perpetuate and influence the magnitude of disparate cancer outcomes. To some extent, high cancer mortality among racial and ethnic minority segments of the population is a national manifestation of a wide range of local problems. A promising strategy to address cancer disparities is to foster research to understand local patterns of cancer mortality and root causes of disparities, and to test interventions informed by those findings that account for the needs of the local community. This paradigm for addressing cancer disparities has been successfully employed by a large cadre of cancer researchers at the University of Illinois Cancer Center (UICC) for more than a decade and forms the basis of the UICC vision to be a “bench- to-community” NCI-designated cancer center. Governors State University (GSU) has invested substantially in basic science and health science infrastructure, increased efforts to recruit faculty members with an interest in research, and significantly enhanced research support services over the past several years. As a result, GSU is positioned to address growing cancer disparities in their community. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop additional infrastructure that will build on the strengths of the partnering institutions in order to enhance their capacity to conduct cancer health inequities research that is driven by local data and informed by the cancer-related needs of local communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE (OVERALL): The GUIDE (GSU-UICC-Disparities-Education) Cancer Research Training Project is a collaborative initiative between GSU and UICC. The institutions will jointly conduct a pilot research project addressing a local, cancer-related health disparity and will develop a training program for GSU junior faculty and undergraduate students designed to attract and prepare investigators for careers in cancer disparities.",2/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project,9037437,P20CA202907,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Peer Review ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' science education ', ' member ', ' Funding Source ', ' Funding Agency ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Localized Malignancy ', ' Localized Cancer ', ' Local Cancer ', ' Localized Malignant Neoplasm ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' UICC ', ' International Union Against Cancer ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' R21 Award ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,GOVERNORS STATE UNIVERSITY,P20,2015,162995,-0.012545005370573833
"2/2 Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: an SCC-SIUSM Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Low-income rural communities experience significant cancer health disparities, including lower screening rates, increased incidence, and later stage at detection, poorer survival, and higher mortality. The Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSM) and its Simmons Cancer Institute serve much of the central rural, southern rural, and Delta regions of Illinois. These rural communities have higher poverty rates and are medically underserved with disparately high cancer burden. SIUSM has established a partnership with the NCI-designated Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) at Washington University in Saint Louis (WUSTL), and SCC's Prevention and Control Program, entitled, Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: An SCC-SIUSM PARTNERSHIP. To prepare for this application, we initiated planning activities in summer 2013. These collaborative planning activities included shared discussions, bi-monthly executive conference calls, in-person meetings at both sites, and early collaborative research efforts between SCC and SIUSM investigators. An Internal Advisory Committee comprised of representatives from each institution and key stakeholders from the region was formed and active in planning this application. The partnership goals are to: 1) build SIUSM cancer research capacity and support SIUSM faculty in transitioning to NIH-funded cancer disparities research, 2) provide opportunities for mid- and senior-level investigators to engage in cross- institutional cancer research and increase the rural cancer research scope and capacity at SCC, and 3) foster the development of post- doctoral scholars and junior faculty at both institutions to develop independent researchers in cancer disparities research. We will use three strategies to achieve these goals: First, a newly developed Pilot Research Program now allows junior investigators to gain research seed funding, collaborative experience and preliminary data for future NIH grants. This growing program prompted by this NCI PAR has already funded one on-going collaborative pilot, and another pilot is included in this application. Second, SCC will provide SIUSM faculty and trainees with access to research seminars and other training opportunities at SCC, and offer short-term investigator exchange programs. Third, building on career development activities ongoing at SCC, the two institutions will share strategies for faculty early career development. In particular, WUSTL's Division of Public Health Sciences offers a 10-month Master's degree in Population Health Science. We will identify clinician-scientists at SIUSM who want to build these research skills through coursework. We envision that these training activities may grow into an R25E or T32 application for rural cancer disparities research. Building on and leveraging the world-class cancer research and training programs at SCC and its Division of Public Health Science, and the rurally-focused mission of SIUSM and its commitment to develop population health science research, this Partnership will provide an important avenue for training and supporting a cadre of basic, clinical and population-based scientists at SIUSM with a focus on alleviating rural cancer disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative (Overall) The overall goal is to establish a highly integrated research and training collaboration focused on rural cancer health disparities between Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSM), an institution that serves the population of Downstate Illinois, a largely rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged region with significant cancer health disparities, and the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University in St. Louis (SCC- WUSTL), an NCI-designated Cancer Center. The Partnership will build SIUSM's research capacity and success conducting NIH-funded cancer disparity research, while also enhancing SCC's rural cancer awareness, research and reach. By doing so, the Partnership will contribute to reducing the cancer health disparities that persist in rural populations.        OVERALL CRITIQUES        ",2/2 Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: an SCC-SIUSM Partnership,9035789,P20CA192966,"['Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Mississippi ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Seeds ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' falls ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Rural Community ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Saints ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Rivers ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Training and Education ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' career development ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', "" Master's Degree "", ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' investigator training ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,P20,2015,174869,-0.021026175122382623
"Minnesota Community Networks Center For Eliminating Cancer Disparaties DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this application is to establish a Regional Community Networks Program known as the Minnesota Community Networks Center to Reduce Cancer Disparities among racial/ethnic minority populations in Minnesota with an initial focus on Minnesota's growing new immigrant and refugee populations using Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach. While Minnesota is often perceived to have few minorities, the state's racial/ethnic distribution has changed substantially. Between 1990 and 2008, African Americans in Minnesota grew from 94,944 to 225,648 (138% growth) Latinos grew from 53,884 to 200,736 (273% growth), Asians grew from 77,886 to 180,835 (132% growth), compared to whites who grew from 4,130,395 to 4,559,336 (10% growth). During the same period, the population of foreign-born individuals in Minnesota increased from 260,000 to 340,000. The proposed Center will build on existing statewide cancer prevention and control infrastructure known as Minnesota Cancer Alliance, and on established successful university-community partnerships. In addition to the CNP headquarters at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, the Center will have sites in Willmar (West Central) and Owatonna (Southern), both rural communities in Minnesota. The proposed CNP center will comprise of four cores: Administrative Core, Community Outreach Core, Research Core, and Training Core. The Administrative Core will provide overall leadership and organizational infrastructure for the Center; the Community Outreach Core will collaborate with established partners. New American Community Services (African immigrants) and Centro Campesino (Latino immigrants) increasing community members' awareness of, knowledge about, and access to cervical and breast cancer screening; the Research Core will support one full project (tobacco use) and one pilot research project (cervical cancer screening); the Training Core will prepare a cadre of scientists and health professionals with focus on underrepresented groups across Minnesota to incorporate CBPR into their cancer research and promote their capacity to achieve sustained career success as community-engaged health disparity researchers.

"Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC2) Center to Reduce Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Western New York (WNY) communities suffer from significant disparities in tobacco use and cessation practices, participation in research opportunities and rates of lung, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers. The proposed Western New York Cancer Coalition (WNYC) Center will address the most striking of these disparities and the burden of cancer in our region by focusing our efforts on minority and urban communities and clinical practices in the cities of Buffalo and Niagara Falls and rural Appalachian communities in neighboring Chautauqua County. We approach the reduction of disparities with clinical and community partnerships from a socio ecological model, with efforts to enhance social capital and reduce perceived racism. The goal of the Center is to ensure that all residents benefit from available clinical and scientific advances to reduce tobacco use, promote healthy lifestyles and behaviors, detect cancer early and participate in clinical and research programs in order to eliminate cancer inequities. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Enhance clinical environments by providing resources, training, outreach and interventions to improve the quality of clinical practice. Aim 2. Enhance outreach to the community by providing technical assistance and tailored outreach interventions to community organizations and partners to increase knowledge of, access to, and use of, beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures. Aim 3. Enhance CBPR training by provide training, mentoring, CBPR and trans-disciplinary research experiences and resources to prepare junior investigators and post-doctoral fellows. Aim 4. Conduct rigorous CBPR research by investigating variables and methods with our community partners to reduce cancer disparities. We propose a full ROI in collaboration with community PCP practices and patients to study the comparative effectiveness of practice enhancements to increase smoking cessation in African American and rural patients; and a pilot study with the Buffalo Latino community to study mechanisms to recruit participants to the cancer center biospecimen banking program. The WNYC^ Center also includes experienced leadership in an Administrative Core, multidimensional Outreach Program, and novel Training Program. The proposed WNYC(2) Center is innovatively designed to reduce inequities in medically underserved populations in three counties in our region.

"Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN) DESCRIPTION: Moffitt Cancer Center and an established network of community partners propose the formation of a regional Center for addressing the cancer burden in a tri-county area. This Center builds on the significant successes of an existing community-academic network program called the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network, draws on enriching programmatic partnerships, and builds on our considerable experience in developing innovative education, training and research programs that recognize the importance of culture and literacy in cancer care. The Center strengthens our community-based infrastructure that is currently characterized by relevant, sincere and trustworthy partnerships that serve medically underserved individuals and families, and which cuts across all racial/ethnic groups including a growing number of foreign-born populations. Grounded in methodological approaches that use community-based participatory research (CBPR), Center aims are to: increase knowledge of, access, and use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures through health promotion and outreach activities; conduct innovative evidence-based research following CBPR principles and to train qualified health disparity researchers in using CBPR approaches. The Center is   comprised of an Administrative Core that provides oversight and three highly complementary Programs   (Outreach, Research and Training) that work synergistically with members of the Steering Committee and Community Advisory Group. The Outreach Program, anchored by activities that engage communities around cancer prevention and control activities, centers on dissemination of credible resources, and makes linkages to the NCI National Outreach Network. The Research Program addresses several determinants (access, knowledge and health literacy) that impact health disparities, and offers solutions by conduct of an investigator initiated intervention research study for increasing uptake of colorectal cancer screening, and a pilot educational research project that extends the CNP Center's interests in biobanking.

"Reducing Asian Hepatitis B Disparities through Health Information Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major preventable health problem in the U.S. and the most pronounced health disparity disfavoring Asian Americans. Unfortunately, HBV patients, especially immigrants and minorities, often do not receive recommended levels of care, indicating a critical need for developing culturally appropriate and effective strategies that can be incorporated into existing clinical practice. The proposed project is a community-scientific collaboration between the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO) and its federally qualified health center member, International Community Health Services (ICHS) in Seattle, WA, as well as our scientific partner affiliated with the University of Washington and Virginia Mason Medical Center, and members of a community-based organization, the Hepatitis B Coalition of Washington. The project will assess the impact of culturally proficient Health Information Technology (HIT) strategies for underserved Asian Americans in Seattle, WA infected with HBV. Community-based participatory approaches will be utilized to conduct a needs assessment and develop a new culturally appropriate intervention to address HBV health disparities applicable across Asian American communities. Mixed methods, including key informant interviews, focus groups, and surveys, that incorporate community participation and perspectives from underserved HBV patients, family members, and providers, will be used to assess the impact of and needs for culturally proficient HIT strategies to improve HBV outcomes for underserved Asian Americans attending a community clinic in Seattle's International j District. The results from the needs assessment will be utilized to develop a pilot intervention incorporating HIT strategies for HBV care with participation and ownership from community-based health centers and their stakeholders. Quantitative methods will be used to test the effectiveness of the culturally proficient intervention in improving HBV vaccination, screening rates, and linkages to care. This project will serve as an important model for developing culturally proficient HBV care approaches integrating health services, HIT, and enabling services (or non-clinical support services) for underserved communities in the U.S.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project was started up by Asian hepatitis b doctors and patients at a clinic, because hepatitis b has become a big issue for Asian people. The clinic's patients, their families, and doctors will work with researchers and partners to find ways to improve hepatitis b care in the clinic and to help educate patients and their families.

"Lay Health Worker Model to Reduce Liver Cancer Disparities in Asian Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is globally most common and serious viral infection of the liver. It can cause premature death from liver diseases or liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection and liver cancer caused by HBV among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) is one of the most serious - but frequently neglected-health disparity issues in the U.S. AAPIs account for over half of the 1.3 million chronic hepatitis B cases and deaths from HBV infection. This excess risk can be attributed to high rates of HBV infection (particularly among first-generation immigrants) in combination with low rates of HBV screening and vaccination due to cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers. HBV infection affect Asian Americans disproportionately, and thus it leads to a huge liver cancer disparity among Asian Americans compared to other racial/ethnic groups.  In response to these cancer disparities, the objective of this project is to build a sustainable, community-based, participator program of lay health workers (LHWs) who can promote liver cancer prevention programs among high-risk groups of Asian Americans. This proposed study attempts to implement culturally integrated liver cancer prevention programs for Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americans through outreach, screening, education, research, and training in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The specific aims are: (1) To develop a training protocol and certificate program for LHWs; (2) To assess the prevalence of HBV infection; (3) To implement intervention programs, based on screening test results; and (4) To evaluate the effectiveness of LHW intervention on adherence to HBV vaccinations among those unprotected.  A total of 600 Asian American adults (200 Chinese, Koreans, and Vietnamese in each group), 18 years of age and older will be recruited from the community. Trained and certified LHWs will recruit participants at community-based organizations and hep B free screening events. All the eligible participants will complete a self-administered questionnaire and receive liver cancer education. Then, they will receive hepatitis B test. Every participant will receive the results of screening tests by mail or phone. We will provide referral services for treatment to those infected. For those unprotected, we will implement intervention programs to increase a series of vaccinations within 6 months using a randomized controlled design. Seven months after mailing the results, we will conduct telephone interviews among those unprotected. Upon completing follow-up, those in the control will receive the delayed LHW intervention. The insights gained from this proposed LHW intervention will be valuable in implementing liver cancer prevention programs for other high-risk non-English speaking populations and will address health disparities among immigrant populations. We will develop and build a sustainable, community-based participatory program to promote live cancer prevention programs for Asian Americans through outreach, education, screening, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of chronic HBV infection in the Baltimore Washington Metropolitan Area.",Lay Health Worker Model to Reduce Liver Cancer Disparities in Asian

"(1/2) University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Project Summary/Abstract: Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry is a highly underserved minority with a significant, disparate burden of cancer. In addition, they are also highly underrepresented among cancer researchers and cancer health care professionals. The University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) have been engaged in a unique and successful partnership over the past twelve years, currently supported by a U54 grant. As the only U54 Partnership addressing cancer health disparities in Pacific Islanders, the UOG/UHCC Partnership is characterized by a significant number of very distinctive aspects and opportunities. In particular, 37% of the Guam population is represented by indigenous Chamorros/part-Chamorros, while 38% are Filipino and Micronesian. The unique ethnic characteristics of this UOG/UHCC Partnership are paralleled by its unique geographic characteristics (the region covered by HI, GU, and U.S. Pacific Territories/jurisdictions), as well as unique regional opportunities for research, education, and outreach. The UOG/UHCC Partnership has indeed been transformational for the UOG and the Territory of Guam as specified in UOG's Letter of Commitment, including the establishment of a Cancer Research Center at UOG and implementation of legislation markedly increasing taxes on tobacco products. At UHCC the U54 has resulted in increased cancer health disparities research in Pacific Islanders. In this U54 renewal application, our overarching goal is to establish our Partner- ship as the national and international leader in advancing cancer health equity in Pacific Islanders. To achieve this goal we will build upon the success of the last five and a half years. All Specific Aims of the individual components of our application support our overall objectives, namely 1) to continue to develop the cancer re- search capability and competitiveness of faculty at UOG by increasing the number of UOG faculty with investigator-initiated funding and peer-reviewed publications; 2) to further develop the focus of UHCC research on cancer health disparities, with particular emphasis on Pacific Islanders and related topics of regional relevance such as betel nut chewing and cervical cancer screening and prevention; 3) To continue raising the awareness of cancer and cancer prevention in the multiethnic communities served by UOG and UHCC, with emphasis on Pacific Islanders; and 4) to increase the number of cancer and biomedical science researchers of Pacific Is- lander ancestry in the U.S. by continuing our successful MA, MS, and PhD training programs for Pacific Is- lander students in cancer-related fields, as well as providing guidance to early stage faculty investigators. The leadership at UOG and UHCC are highly committed to this Partnership as evidenced by their strong Letters of Support and the commitment of significant resources to the Partnership.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative:  This grant has supported the only cancer research infrastructure established west of Hawaii, in the U.S. Territory of Guam. Continued funding will support three research projects described herein, focusing on cancers of regional significance. The partnership provides opportunities for faculty as well as pre-doctoral and post-doctoral students to develop and strengthen skills in project design and administration, team collaboration, recruitment and retention, specimen collection, data analysis, manuscript writing, grantsmanship among others.

"Southeast Michigan Community Network Program DESCRIPTION: This application, in response to RFA-CA-09-032, Community Networks Program (U54), proposes to continue our vibrant, comprehensive, and sustainable program to reduce disparities in breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers that adversely affect older, underserved, African American adults in southeast Michigan. Under CNP I, we have mobilized with extraordinary community partners to implement an integrated system of community-based participatory education, training, and research activities. Our regional CNP II Center will include four large urban areas severely impacted by economic hardship: Detroit, Inkster, Southfield, and Pontiac. This tri-county area accounts for 71.3% of Michigan's African American population and 42% of the state's below poverty population. In SE Michigan, older African Americans have higher rates of poverty and comorbid medical diseases related to being underserved medically (5, 6). Our team of collaborating investigators and community partners will continue to build on our established partnerships. The effort will be led by the Karmanos Cancer Institute, the School of Medicine at Wayne State University, and the Josephine Ford Cancer Center of the Henry Ford Health System. Support for our CNP I and now CNP II is broadly based, demonstrated by the community leaders, researchers, clinicians and public officials with whom we have strong relationships and who have joined our Center Steering Committee and Community Advisory Group, and have written letters of support included in this application. We propose a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach to address three aims for reducing disparities: Aim 1. To continue to increase knowledge, access and use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures to reduce disparities related to breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer, among older, underserved African American adults in southeast Michigan; Aim 2. To continue to develop and implement evidence-based intervention research to increase use of beneficial biomedical and behavioral procedures for cancer prevention, detection and treatment of older African Americans; and Aim 3. To recruit and train a critical mass of promising and successful new researchers in CBPR to reduce cancer health disparities. RELEVANCE (See Instructions):  Older African Americans disproportionately experience higher rates of cancers, are first diagnosed at advanced stage disease, and suffer higher mortality rates.

"2/2 SDSU/UCSD Cancer Center Comprehensive Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) OVERALL ABSTRACT: This application seeks funding to continue to support the SDSU/UCSD Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership. Our vision, consistent with that of the Comprehensive Partnership for the Advancement of Health Equity (CPACHE) program, is to continue to develop outstanding programs in research, research education, and community outreach in order to understand and address causes for cancer health disparities in our catchment areas of San Diego and Imperial counties, a region with a large and growing Hispanic/Latino population. As this population ages, the number of cancer cases is expected to grow. Addressing the existing gaps in research, education, and health care delivery in this ethnic group is a high priority of our Partnership, which leverages th distinct yet complementary strengths and resources of San Diego State University (SDSU), an officially designated Hispanic Serving Institution, and the University of California (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center (MCC), an NCI-designated Cancer Center. The goal of our Partnership is to reduce the burden of cancer among Hispanic/Latino communities in our catchment area. We accomplish this by building research and research education capacity and by continuing to improve outreach and education to underserved communities in our area, with a special emphasis on Hispanic/Latinos. The PIs represent an outstanding multidisciplinary team of experienced researchers and academic leaders in their own areas. Consistent with the overall goals of the CPACHE program and taking advantage of unique and complementary resources at SDSU and UCSD, we have established an outstanding scientific and leadership team. The complement of two population scientists (Drs. E. Martinez and E. Arredondo), a physician scientist (Dr. S. Crowe), and a basic scientist (Dr. M. Sussman) makes for an outstanding synergistic scientific team. The application includes two Full and one Pilot Project which were selected for their strong hypothesis-driven research aimed at enhancing research capacity at SDSU and increasing cancer disparities research at UCSD. This is complemented by a new Research Education program aimed at providing research experience in cancer and cancer disparities to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups who will be largely Hispanic/Latino. Finally, the Outreach Core involves a unique triad partnership that includes the MCC, SDSU, and federally qualified community health centers that serve the majority of uninsured and Medicaid insured Hispanic/Latinos in a large metropolitan area and along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Partnership has strong institutional commitment, a comprehensive planning and evaluation plan, and the guidance of an outstanding Internal Advisory Board and a stellar Program Steering Committee. There is sound rationale for the continuation of our Partnership as it has and will continue to provide unique, significant, and impactful programs in cancer research, research education, and community outreach. Taken together, the new PI leadership has developed a strong renewal application that meets all the goals of the NCI U54 PACHE program.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the application is to seek funding to continue to support the SDSU/UCSD Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership in order to continue to develop outstanding programs in research, research education, and community outreach to understand causes for cancer health disparities and to reduce the burden of cancer among Hispanic/Latino communities in our catchment areas of San Diego and Imperial counties. This region has a large and growing Hispanic/Latino population. Addressing the existing gaps in research, education, and health care delivery in underserved communities is a high priority of our Partnership, which leverages the distinct yet complementary strengths and resources of San Diego State University (SDSU), an officially designated Hispanic Serving Institution, and the University of California (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center (MCC).        OVERALL CRITIQUES        ",2/2 SDSU/UCSD Cancer Center Comprehensive Partnership,9043691,U54CA132384,"['Age ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Critiques ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mexico ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' sound ', ' Students ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' County ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Uninsured ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' outreach ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Qualifying ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U54,2015,1266713,-0.020229976056760354
"Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Intiative (1 of 2)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal entitled the Chicago Southside Cancer Disparities Initiative (CSCDI) seeks support to form a partnership between the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC), a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and Chicago State University (CSU), a minority serving institution, to develop an infrastructure for cancer education, training and outreach. Abiding to the call for action to increase underrepresented minorities in the health care workforce as a mechanism to reduce disparities and advance research pertinent to the community, it is critical that we develop educational and academic pathways to increase knowledge transfer at the undergraduate and graduate levels. To this end, the CSCDI's objectives are to: 1) Create an Inter-University collaboration to develop, implement and evaluate cancer disparities curriculum to be integrated within selected CSU's current MPH curriculum as well as UC's Pritzker School of Medicine's (PSOM) curriculum. 2) Provide opportunities for community involvement through collaboratively developing and enhancing existing service learning sites(i.e. community organization) at both institutions; 3) Train MPH cohorts to engage service learning sites(i.e. community organization) in cancer prevention, health promotion and dissemination of cancer research; and 4) Expand education and training beyond the 4-year grant period by utilizing an NCI mechanism Cancer Education Program (R25E) or other federal agency collaborative research training grant There is a pressing need to improve cancer outcomes in Chicago. Specifically, UCCCC has been a leading institution for groundbreaking cancer research and technological advances. However, impact at the community level has been challenging and research dissemination into communities has been weak. CSU, an urban public University has had a long history of education, leadership and commitment to the Chicago's Southside. CSU has recently developed a new Master of Public Health (MPH) program to focus on minority health and health equity, providing an exciting opportunity for our partnership. However, despite CSU's strengths and reach, their research program and expertise in cancer disparities are tenuous, while cancer disparities on Chicago's Southside are on the rise. CSCDI, therefore, is an innovative and timely partnership that will bridge outstanding minority students and faculty together with nationally recognized educators and researchers in the field of cancer to increase the pool of minority public health professionals interested in studying cancer disparities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer disparities among minority communities continue to grow. It is time to affect change by diversifying the health professional work force, a critical stp to the continued progress of cancer research, knowledge transfer and the understanding of cancer disparities among marginalized groups.  By providing education to a diverse public health workforce, we will improve dissemination, strengthen our reach and collaborate to affect change.",Chicago South Side Cancer Disparities Intiative (1 of 2),8920095,P20CA165582,"['Affect ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mission ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' cohort ', ' cancer education ', ' Institution ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' M.P.H.

"CAUSES: Causes of Asian American mortality Understood by Socio-Economic Status  PROJECT SUMMARY Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States, with a population of over 14 million that is projected to reach nearly 34 million by 2050. However, our current understanding of Asian Americans is as an aggregated group, and very little is known about the six diverse Asian American racial/ethnic subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese), who have a wide range of disease risks, immigration histories, and socioeconomic status. There is currently a knowledge gap on the health of these expanding subpopulations, and there is no information to recommend research agendas, create public health policy, and offer clinical guidelines. Our current understanding of Asian American mortality patterns is distorted by the aggregation of distinct subgroups, the grouping of foreign-born and U.S.- born populations, and the unknown impact of sociodemographic factors. While the U.S. Census first started disaggregating Asian subgroups in 1980, disaggregation of Asian subgroups on U.S. death records occurred much later in 2003, and now over half of the 50 U.S. States disaggregate Asian subgroups. The goal of this study is to examine racial/ethnic, nativity, and geographic differences in Asian American subgroup mortality compared to other racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics). Investigation of cause-specific mortality in distinct subgroups, by nativity, and considering sociodemographic factors will be fundamental in assessing and addressing health disparities in Asian American communities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The current lack of national mortality statistics for Asian American subgroups makes it difficult to recommend research agendas, create public health policy, and offer clinical guidelines for diverse Asian American subgroups. The goal of this study is to examine racial/ethnic, nativity, and geographic disparities in Asian American subgroup mortality compared to other racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics).",CAUSES: Causes of Asian American mortality Understood by Socio-Economic Status,8804208,R01MD007012,"['Age ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death Records ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Heart ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Housing ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' County ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Attenuated ', ' Koreans ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' Coronary ', ' Hindu ', ' Asian Indian ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ']",NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,401250,0.07011385678788916

"Lay Health Worker Model to Reduce Liver Cancer Disparities in Asian Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is globally most common and serious viral infection of the liver. It can cause premature death from liver diseases or liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection and liver cancer caused by HBV among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) is one of the most serious - but frequently neglected-health disparity issues in the U.S. AAPIs account for over half of the 1.3 million chronic hepatitis B cases and deaths from HBV infection. This excess risk can be attributed to high rates of HBV infection (particularly among first-generation immigrants) in combination with low rates of HBV screening and vaccination due to cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers. HBV infection affect Asian Americans disproportionately, and thus it leads to a huge liver cancer disparity among Asian Americans compared to other racial/ethnic groups.  In response to these cancer disparities, the objective of this project is to build a sustainable, community-based, participator program of lay health workers (LHWs) who can promote liver cancer prevention programs among high-risk groups of Asian Americans. This proposed study attempts to implement culturally integrated liver cancer prevention programs for Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americans through outreach, screening, education, research, and training in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The specific aims are: (1) To develop a training protocol and certificate program for LHWs; (2) To assess the prevalence of HBV infection; (3) To implement intervention programs, based on screening test results; and (4) To evaluate the effectiveness of LHW intervention on adherence to HBV vaccinations among those unprotected.  A total of 600 Asian American adults (200 Chinese, Koreans, and Vietnamese in each group), 18 years of age and older will be recruited from the community. Trained and certified LHWs will recruit participants at community-based organizations and hep B free screening events. All the eligible participants will complete a self-administered questionnaire and receive liver cancer education. Then, they will receive hepatitis B test. Every participant will receive the results of screening tests by mail or phone. We will provide referral services for treatment to those infected. For those unprotected, we will implement intervention programs to increase a series of vaccinations within 6 months using a randomized controlled design. Seven months after mailing the results, we will conduct telephone interviews among those unprotected. Upon completing follow-up, those in the control will receive the delayed LHW intervention. The insights gained from this proposed LHW intervention will be valuable in implementing liver cancer prevention programs for other high-risk non-English speaking populations and will address health disparities among immigrant populations. We will develop and build a sustainable, community-based participatory program to promote live cancer prevention programs for Asian Americans through outreach, education, screening, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of chronic HBV infection in the Baltimore Washington Metropolitan Area.",Lay Health Worker Model to Reduce Liver Cancer Disparities in Asian

"3/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE        Project Narrative: The presence of major cancer health inequities in Chicago is well-documented. This proposed 3 institutional partnership poses a strong and important approach for reducing deeply-engrained disparities. CCPACHE is a partnership in research, education, and community outreach aimed directly at building and fostering the next generation pipeline of students and faculty entering health-related careers, increasing the number of cancer health disparities researchers, and facilitating the translation of cancer research that is directly informed by, and relevant to, Chicagoland communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",3/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity,9149180,U54CA202997,"['abstracting ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Mission ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University ', ' forging ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' under-represented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' Minority Graduate Student ', ' minority graduate ', ' student training ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U54,2016,1442885,-0.016855895909280497
"2/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) initiated their Partnership in August 2002. The early years of the Partnership during the U56 funding period (2005-2010) established the foundational support and scientific leadership needed to build a solid and vibrant research collaboration. Moving forward, the U54 mechanism drew on this foundation resulting in a robust set of activities in research, capacity building and outreach. Two key tenets guide this sustained partnership between UMass Boston and DF/HCC: a) A common and intense interest in addressing the problem of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality; and b) A belief that through the Partnership, each institution will achieve benefits that neither could achieve on its own. This application for renewal provides extensive evidence of the ways these tenets have been operationalized, the resulting benefits for both institutions and the ways in which this Partnership is now poised to make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control. We are proposing activities that draw on the latest science to understand and address cancer disparities through a transdisciplinary approach that embodies our Partnership theme of “Cells to Society. In support of our new cohesive theme, we have proposed three sophisticated, highly competitive research projects across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. To elucidate new areas of research opportunity, the Partnership is excited to explore the intersection between biology-based sciences and social/behavioral sciences. The immediate priorities Summary: ” of the Partnership are: 1) Continuing capacity building for biomedical and cancer research at UMass Boston and cancer disparities research at DF/HCC; 2) Enhancing and scaling up research experiences for students with a specific focus on underrepresented minorities (URMs), across the entire educational pipeline –from undergraduate to postdoctoral levels (see Research Education Core); 3) Continuing close mentoring of early stage investigators with a focus on research and career development; 4) Building a strong and robust Outreach Core that draws on the state of the science from dissemination and implementation sciences (D&I) for building partnerships, translating knowledge and monitoring the results of the translation efforts to build and sustain capacity among community-based organizations (see Outreach Core); 5) Offering infrastructural support to U54 investigators through two service cores, including the Research Design and Analysis, and Genomics Cores (see Shared Resource Core); and 6) Ensuring sustainability for projects, Cores and research education programs via dedicated planning and execution of grant matching with NIH-mechanisms, foundation support and/or institutional support.

"1/2 NCCU-DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership ABSTRACT The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) – DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership (NCCU-DCI-CDTRP) is focused on developing infrastructure for translational cancer health disparities research, education and training and on performing two such pilot research projects, focusing on the molecular aspects underlying the increased lethality of prostate and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans, with direct application to prevention, detection and treatment. This Program is built on the long-standing relationship between the two Durham-based Institutions, less than four miles apart. NCCU is an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students (ISUPS), affiliated with the 17-member University of North Carolina system and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center (CC). The Partnership, focusing on translational cancer health disparities research and education and training of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage investigators (ESIs) in this field, which is described by the NIH Translational Research Working Group, will distinguish itself with synergistic complementarity to an existing U54 between NCCU and UNC, which focuses on sociocultural disparities research and education and training of undergraduate students. To this Partnership, the Biomanufacturing Research Institute and Technology Enterprise (BRITE) faculty at NCCU will bring a unique perspective from an ISUPS, expertise in pharmaceuticals, drug discovery and development, as well as existing extensive health disparities education and training programs. The CC, DCI, will bring a unique distinguishing focus on biospecimen collection, correlative science in the context of clinical trials, development of racially diverse cancer patient-derived models and programs addressing minority accrual to treatment and biospecimen collection clinical trials. Development of the Partnership occurred and is continuing around planning and priority-setting stages, including selection of co-developed, collaborative pilot research projects and creation of a fully integrated, bi-directional, mutually beneficial Cancer Research Education Program (CREP). The Implementation stage will launch the pilot research projects, utilizing nearly 25 Shared Resources between NCCU and Duke, the CREP and the engagement of underserved minority populations across the region and state, with complementary existing programming mutually emanating from NCCU, which directly serves a minority community, and DCI’s Office of Health Equity and Disparities. The Partnership will be led by an integrated Administrative Core of senior investigators who will serve as mentors to ESIs, rigorously addressing career development, to postdoctoral fellows and to graduate students and will include an extensive Evaluation Program for tracking impact and outcomes. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), an External Advisory Committee (EAC), focused solely on scientific guidance, and a Community Advisory Board (CAB). This NCI P20 collaborative partnership, “North Carolina Central University–Duke Cancer Institute Cancer Disparities Translational Research Program” (NCCU-DCI CDTRP), is relevant to cancer health disparities research, education and training. Regarding research, this application’s Pilot Projects focus on understanding and modulating molecular pathways in human tumors that contribute to the increased lethality of prostate cancer and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans. Elucidating these pathways will contribute to better prevention, detection and treatment of these cancers. The Administrative Core and aforementioned Pilot Projects will be done by DCI, a NCI- designated Cancer Center, and NCCU, an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students, in collaboration. Finally, a bi-directional Cancer Research Education Program is integrated to train the next generation of underserved and minority graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage faculty

"2/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Individuals from underserved minority communities in the U.S. experience poor outcomes for the majority of cancers as a result of inequities in access to high quality healthcare, socio-cultural and environmental determinants, and in some cases behavioral and biologic factors. Inequities in cancer outcomes are rooted in a wide range of structural, socio-cultural, and policy-related determinants that are operative throughout the U.S., but local factors can perpetuate and influence the magnitude of disparate cancer outcomes. To some extent, high cancer mortality among racial and ethnic minority segments of the population is a national manifestation of a wide range of local problems. A promising strategy to address cancer disparities is to foster research to understand local patterns of cancer mortality and root causes of disparities, and to test interventions informed by those findings that account for the needs of the local community. This paradigm for addressing cancer disparities has been successfully employed by a large cadre of cancer researchers at the University of Illinois Cancer Center (UICC) for more than a decade and forms the basis of the UICC vision to be a “bench- to-community” NCI-designated cancer center. Governors State University (GSU) has invested substantially in basic science and health science infrastructure, increased efforts to recruit faculty members with an interest in research, and significantly enhanced research support services over the past several years. As a result, GSU is positioned to address growing cancer disparities in their community. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop additional infrastructure that will build on the strengths of the partnering institutions in order to enhance their capacity to conduct cancer health inequities research that is driven by local data and informed by the cancer-related needs of local communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE (OVERALL): The GUIDE (GSU-UICC-Disparities-Education) Cancer Research Training Project is a collaborative initiative between GSU and UICC.

"2/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE        Project Narrative: The presence of major cancer health inequities in Chicago is well-documented. This proposed 3 institutional partnership poses a strong and important approach for reducing deeply-engrained disparities. CCPACHE is a partnership in research, education, and community outreach aimed directly at building and fostering the next generation pipeline of students and faculty entering health-related careers, increasing the number of cancer health disparities researchers, and facilitating the translation of cancer research that is directly informed by, and relevant to, Chicagoland communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",2/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity,9149181,U54CA202995,"['abstracting ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Mission ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University ', ' forging ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' under-represented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' Minority Graduate Student ', ' minority graduate ', ' student training ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,U54,2016,1069180,-0.016855895909280497

"1/2 SDSU/UCSD Cancer Center Comprehensive Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) OVERALL ABSTRACT: This application seeks funding to continue to support the SDSU/UCSD Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership. Our vision, consistent with that of the Comprehensive Partnership for the Advancement of Health Equity (CPACHE) program, is to continue to develop outstanding programs in research, research education, and community outreach in order to understand and address causes for cancer health disparities in our catchment areas of San Diego and Imperial counties, a region with a large and growing Hispanic/Latino population. As this population ages, the number of cancer cases is expected to grow. Addressing the existing gaps in research, education, and health care delivery in this ethnic group is a high priority of our Partnership, which leverages th distinct yet complementary strengths and resources of San Diego State University (SDSU), an officially designated Hispanic Serving Institution, and the University of California (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center (MCC), an NCI-designated Cancer Center. The goal of our Partnership is to reduce the burden of cancer among Hispanic/Latino communities in our catchment area. We accomplish this by building research and research education capacity and by continuing to improve outreach and education to underserved communities in our area, with a special emphasis on Hispanic/Latinos. The PIs represent an outstanding multidisciplinary team of experienced researchers and academic leaders in their own areas. Consistent with the overall goals of the CPACHE program and taking advantage of unique and complementary resources at SDSU and UCSD, we have established an outstanding scientific and leadership team. The complement of two population scientists (Drs. E. Martinez and E. Arredondo), a physician scientist (Dr. S. Crowe), and a basic scientist (Dr. M. Sussman) makes for an outstanding synergistic scientific team. The application includes two Full and one Pilot Project which were selected for their strong hypothesis-driven research aimed at enhancing research capacity at SDSU and increasing cancer disparities research at UCSD. This is complemented by a new Research Education program aimed at providing research experience in cancer and cancer disparities to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups who will be largely Hispanic/Latino. Finally, the Outreach Core involves a unique triad partnership that includes the MCC, SDSU, and federally qualified community health centers that serve the majority of uninsured and Medicaid insured Hispanic/Latinos in a large metropolitan area and along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Partnership has strong institutional commitment, a comprehensive planning and evaluation plan, and the guidance of an outstanding Internal Advisory Board and a stellar Program Steering Committee. There is sound rationale for the continuation of our Partnership as it has and will continue to provide unique, significant, and impactful programs in cancer research, research education, and community outreach. Taken together, the new PI leadership has developed a strong renewal application that meets all the goals of the NCI U54 PACHE program.

"South Carolina Cancer Health Equity Consortium (SC CHEC): Summer Undergraduate Research Training Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), the University of South Carolina (USC), and three historically black colleges/universities - Claflin University (CU), South Carolina State University (SCSU), and Voorhees College (VC) - have joined forces under the larger aegis of the South Carolina Cancer Health Equity Consortium (SC CHEC) to develop this application for an R25E NIH/NCI Cancer Education Grants Program. Together, these institutions have created an innovative, inter-institutional, 14-week summer course. This is combined with a hands-on laboratory research training platform and career mentoring by some of the nation's leading cancer researchers to attract and catalyze a new generation of diverse biomedical scientists. Within this new five-year initiative, 80 undergraduate juniors and seniors (designated as SC CHEC Student Fellows) from USC, CU, SCSU, and VC will engage with investigators at the MUSC Hollings Cancer Center, a National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated cancer center, to expose them to the latest advances in biomedical research spanning basic, clinical, and population sciences with an emphasis on cancer disparity dynamics in South Carolina (SC). The curriculum and training of this new initiative are focused on four of the most disparate cancers in terms of incidence, morbidity, and mortality in SC - breast, prostate, head/neck, and cervical cancer. Health outcomes for patients diagnosed with these four cancers are strongly influenced by race, ethnicity, urban/rural residence, socioeconomic position, and potentially biology. This R25E program's primary strategy will employ in-person classroom and laboratory instruction within the context of contemporary scientific approaches to cancer research at MUSC. These will be complemented by selected clinical and biotechnology-focused rotations, community engagement, and Graduate Record Examination preparation. The SC CHEC leadership strongly believes that promoting interest, career development, and commitment from the Millennial Generation (those born in the 1990s) to cancer biomedical and biobehavioral research is a critical step to attaining health equity and improved health outcomes in SC and beyond.

"2/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE        Project Narrative: The presence of major cancer health inequities in Chicago is well-documented. This proposed 3 institutional partnership poses a strong and important approach for reducing deeply-engrained disparities. CCPACHE is a partnership in research, education, and community outreach aimed directly at building and fostering the next generation pipeline of students and faculty entering health-related careers, increasing the number of cancer health disparities researchers, and facilitating the translation of cancer research that is directly informed by, and relevant to, Chicagoland communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",2/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity,9320073,U54CA202995,"['abstracting ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Mission ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University ', ' forging ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' under-represented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' Minority Graduate Student ', ' minority graduate ', ' student training ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,U54,2016,39000,-0.016855895909280497
"CAUSES: Causes of Asian American mortality Understood by Socio-Economic Status PROJECT SUMMARY Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States, with a population of over 14 million that is projected to reach nearly 34 million by 2050. However, our current understanding of Asian Americans is as an aggregated group, and very little is known about the six diverse Asian American racial/ethnic subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese), who have a wide range of disease risks, immigration histories, and socioeconomic status. There is currently a knowledge gap on the health of these expanding subpopulations, and there is no information to recommend research agendas, create public health policy, and offer clinical guidelines. Our current understanding of Asian American mortality patterns is distorted by the aggregation of distinct subgroups, the grouping of foreign-born and U.S.- born populations, and the unknown impact of sociodemographic factors. While the U.S. Census first started disaggregating Asian subgroups in 1980, disaggregation of Asian subgroups on U.S. death records occurred much later in 2003, and now over half of the 50 U.S. States disaggregate Asian subgroups. The goal of this study is to examine racial/ethnic, nativity, and geographic differences in Asian American subgroup mortality compared to other racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics). Investigation of cause-specific mortality in distinct subgroups, by nativity, and considering sociodemographic factors will be fundamental in assessing and addressing health disparities in Asian American communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The current lack of national mortality statistics for Asian American subgroups makes it difficult to recommend research agendas, create public health policy, and offer clinical guidelines for diverse Asian American subgroups. The goal of this study is to examine racial/ethnic, nativity, and geographic disparities in Asian American subgroup mortality compared to other racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics).",CAUSES: Causes of Asian American mortality Understood by Socio-Economic Status,8974786,R01MD007012,"['Age ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death Records ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Economics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Services ', ' Heart ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Housing ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' County ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Attenuated ', ' Koreans ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' mortality statistics ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' Coronary ', ' Hindu ', ' Asian Indian ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ']",NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,401250,0.07011385678788916
"NYU Center for the Study of Asian American Health The New York University (NYU) Center for the Study of Asian American Health (CSAAH) is a partnership of an academic medical and research center (NYU), several healthcare and public hospital organizations, and more than 55 community and government partners serving NYC's Asian American community. CSAAH's primary mission is to address, alleviate, and eliminate Asian American health disparities through a trans disciplinary and community-engaged research approach. To accomplish this mission, CSAAH is committed to the following guiding principles: 1) systemic change through the use of multiple strategies and working with diverse stakeholders; 2) equitable ""partnerships"" in research, training, and outreach; 3) action-oriented research; 4) strengthening research capacity of both community and academic partners to fully engage in the research process; and 5) conducting multicultural evaluation as a means to foster ownership, sustainability and impact. These guiding principles are integrated in each of CSAAH's four cores: 1)  Administrative, 2) Research, 3) Research Training and Education, and 4) Community Engagement and Outreach. The Specific Aims of the overall Center are to: a) develop and conduct research to understand, address, and eliminate health disparities in the Asian American community; b) build new and strengthen existing private and public partnerships in order to increase outreach, dissemination advocacy, and research capacity to address Asian American health disparities and social inequalities; and c) train a cadre of health and public health professionals on community-based approaches to conducting research, outreach, service delivery, and advocacy in the Asian American community. CSAAH has been organized into five research tracks: 1) Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes; 2) Tumorigenesis; 3) Mental Health; 4) Social and Cultural Determinants of Health; and 5) Pilot Project Research. There are two main research projects proposed for this application. The OASIS Project is focused on developing and implementing a culturally-appropriate faith-based intervention to reduce obesity and social stressors in South Asian communities. The second research project tests the efficacy of a pilot intervention to reduce the risk of lymphedema among Chinese breast cancer survivors and improve quality of life and health issues for these women. In addition, there are many community engagement, research training, education, dissemination, and community health and resource needs assessments planned during the grant period with local and national academic and community partners serving Asian Americans populations.  There are significant and pervasive disparities in health status and access to care for Asian Americans in the U.S. The goal of this project is to implement a community-engaged and multi-level approach to conducting research, dissemination, research training and educational strategies to reduce health disparities in Asian American populations.",NYU Center for the Study of Asian American Health,8962089,P60MD000538,"['Asian Americans ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Lymphedema ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mission ', ' New York ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Ownership ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Medical Research ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Advocacy ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Training and Education ', ' stressor ', ' social inequality ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' hospital organization ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Training ', ' Outreach Research ', ' South Asian ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' dissemination research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' service intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' faith-based intervention ', ' public-private partnership ', ' Breast Cancer survivor ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P60,2016,1647082,0.07904442432724074
"CBPR:  Enhancing Capacity to Use Innovative Methodologies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for the use of innovative methodologies in the behavioral and social sciences has been widely noted. The past two decades have seen continued recognition that more innovative and community-engaged approaches to research and interventions are needed to address the social and environmental determinants of population health and more specifically racial and ethnic inequities in health. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is one such approach to community-engaged research. Increased funding support for CBPR is in keeping with the mission statement of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the research capacity- building priorities delineated in the NIH Health Disparities Strategic Plan 2009-2013, and select research goals of the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR). As the need for and opportunities to expand CBPR increases, so does the need to enhance capacity in innovative methods for researchers conducting behavioral and social sciences research (BSSR) to use this approach. Not only is CBPR an innovative approach in and of itself for many researchers conducting BSSR, there are also several specific innovations within the context of a CBPR approach that are particularly relevant to the mission of NIH. These innovative methods include the integrated use of mixed methods (combining qualitative and quantitative methods), and innovative research designs that complement randomized controlled designs. Although numerous educational materials on CBPR have been developed in recent years, there are few opportunities for both early-career and established researchers to engage in a co-learning process facilitated by experienced academic-community faculty teams. Further, there is a need to promote the diversity of the BSSR workforce, including increasing participation of researchers from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Thus, the overarching goal of the proposed research education program, Community-Based Participatory Research: Enhancing Capacity to Use Innovative Methodologies in the Behavioral and Social Sciences (the Enhance Program), is to enhance knowledge and skills in the use of innovative methodologies in CBPR, in partnership with the communities involved, to examine and address health inequities. The proposed Enhance Program will be carried out by the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center (Detroit URC), a CBPR partnership established in 1995 to understand and address factors that contribute to health inequities in Detroit. The two- pronged approach of the Enhance Program is: 1) to develop, implement, and evaluate an intensive short course in innovative methodologies in CBPR for conducting behavioral and social sciences research; and 2) to enhance and integrate learning from the short course through a series of follow-on educational activities, an applied CBPR project, mentoring, and development of a network of diverse scholars for career development and innovation in BSSR using a CBPR approach to promote health equity. An evaluation will be conducted to assess and enhance program effectiveness. The curriculum and other materials will be widely disseminated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To solve complex public health problems, community-based participatory research (CBPR), a collaborative, participatory approach between academic and community partners is particularly effective. CBPR is an innovative approach for researchers conducting behavioral and social sciences research and numerous innovative methods are relevant within this approach. This program aims to build the capacity of academic and community partners to implement CBPR principles and innovative methodologies in their work.",CBPR:  Enhancing Capacity to Use Innovative Methodologies,9113579,R25GM111837,"['Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Educational Activities ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Educational Materials ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' network models ', ' social science research ', ' health equity ', ' population health ', ' faculty community ', ' education research ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R25,2016,206558,0.04107435639004059
"2/2 SDSU/UCSD Cancer Center Comprehensive Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) OVERALL ABSTRACT: This application seeks funding to continue to support the SDSU/UCSD Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership. Our vision, consistent with that of the Comprehensive Partnership for the Advancement of Health Equity (CPACHE) program, is to continue to develop outstanding programs in research, research education, and community outreach in order to understand and address causes for cancer health disparities in our catchment areas of San Diego and Imperial counties, a region with a large and growing Hispanic/Latino population. As this population ages, the number of cancer cases is expected to grow. Addressing the existing gaps in research, education, and health care delivery in this ethnic group is a high priority of our Partnership, which leverages th distinct yet complementary strengths and resources of San Diego State University (SDSU), an officially designated Hispanic Serving Institution, and the University of California (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center (MCC), an NCI-designated Cancer Center. The goal of our Partnership is to reduce the burden of cancer among Hispanic/Latino communities in our catchment area. We accomplish this by building research and research education capacity and by continuing to improve outreach and education to underserved communities in our area, with a special emphasis on Hispanic/Latinos. The PIs represent an outstanding multidisciplinary team of experienced researchers and academic leaders in their own areas. Consistent with the overall goals of the CPACHE program and taking advantage of unique and complementary resources at SDSU and UCSD, we have established an outstanding scientific and leadership team. The complement of two population scientists (Drs. E. Martinez and E. Arredondo), a physician scientist (Dr. S. Crowe), and a basic scientist (Dr. M. Sussman) makes for an outstanding synergistic scientific team. The application includes two Full and one Pilot Project which were selected for their strong hypothesis-driven research aimed at enhancing research capacity at SDSU and increasing cancer disparities research at UCSD. This is complemented by a new Research Education program aimed at providing research experience in cancer and cancer disparities to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups who will be largely Hispanic/Latino. Finally, the Outreach Core involves a unique triad partnership that includes the MCC, SDSU, and federally qualified community health centers that serve the majority of uninsured and Medicaid insured Hispanic/Latinos in a large metropolitan area and along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Partnership has strong institutional commitment, a comprehensive planning and evaluation plan, and the guidance of an outstanding Internal Advisory Board and a stellar Program Steering Committee. There is sound rationale for the continuation of our Partnership as it has and will continue to provide unique, significant, and impactful programs in cancer research, research education, and community outreach. Taken together, the new PI leadership has developed a strong renewal application that meets all the goals of the NCI U54 PACHE program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the application is to seek funding to continue to support the SDSU/UCSD Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership in order to continue to develop outstanding programs in research, research education, and community outreach to understand causes for cancer health disparities and to reduce the burden of cancer among Hispanic/Latino communities in our catchment areas of San Diego and Imperial counties.

"2/2, University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry is a highly underserved minority with a significant, disparate burden of cancer. In addition, they are also highly underrepresented among cancer researchers and cancer health care professionals. The University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) have been engaged in a unique and successful partnership over the past twelve years, currently supported by a U54 grant. As the only U54 Partnership addressing cancer health disparities in Pacific Islanders, the UOG/UHCC Partnership is characterized by a significant number of very distinctive aspects and opportunities. In particular, 37% of the Guam population is represented by indigenous Chamorros/part-Chamorros, while 38% are Filipino and Micronesian. The unique ethnic characteristics of this UOG/UHCC Partnership are paralleled by its unique geographic characteristics (the region covered by HI, GU, and U.S. Pacific Territories/jurisdictions), as well as unique regional opportunities for research, education, and outreach. The UOG/UHCC Partnership has indeed been transformational for the UOG and the Territory of Guam as specified in UOG's Letter of Commitment, including the establishment of a Cancer Research Center at UOG and implementation of legislation markedly increasing taxes on tobacco products. At UHCC the U54 has resulted in increased cancer health disparities research in Pacific Islanders. In this U54 renewal application, our overarching goal is to establish our Partner- ship as the national and international leader in advancing cancer health equity in Pacific Islanders. To achieve this goal we will build upon the success of the last five and a half years. All Specific Aims of the individual components of our application support our overall objectives, namely 1) to continue to develop the cancer re- search capability and competitiveness of faculty at UOG by increasing the number of UOG faculty with investigator-initiated funding and peer-reviewed publications; 2) to further develop the focus of UHCC research on cancer health disparities, with particular emphasis on Pacific Islanders and related topics of regional relevance such as betel nut chewing and cervical cancer screening and prevention; 3) To continue raising the awareness of cancer and cancer prevention in the multiethnic communities served by UOG and UHCC, with emphasis on Pacific Islanders; and 4) to increase the number of cancer and biomedical science researchers of Pacific Is- lander ancestry in the U.S. by continuing our successful MA, MS, and PhD training programs for Pacific Is- lander students in cancer-related fields, as well as providing guidance to early stage faculty investigators. The leadership at UOG and UHCC are highly committed to this Partnership as evidenced by their strong Letters of Support and the commitment of significant resources to the Partnership. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This grant has supported the only cancer research infrastructure established west of Hawaii, in the U.S. Territory of Guam. Continued funding will support three research projects described herein, focusing on cancers of regional significance.

"(1/2) University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Project Summary/Abstract: Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry is a highly underserved minority with a significant, disparate burden of cancer. In addition, they are also highly underrepresented among cancer researchers and cancer health care professionals. The University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) have been engaged in a unique and successful partnership over the past twelve years, currently supported by a U54 grant. As the only U54 Partnership addressing cancer health disparities in Pacific Islanders, the UOG/UHCC Partnership is characterized by a significant number of very distinctive aspects and opportunities. In particular, 37% of the Guam population is represented by indigenous Chamorros/part-Chamorros, while 38% are Filipino and Micronesian. The unique ethnic characteristics of this UOG/UHCC Partnership are paralleled by its unique geographic characteristics (the region covered by HI, GU, and U.S. Pacific Territories/jurisdictions), as well as unique regional opportunities for research, education, and outreach. The UOG/UHCC Partnership has indeed been transformational for the UOG and the Territory of Guam as specified in UOG's Letter of Commitment, including the establishment of a Cancer Research Center at UOG and implementation of legislation markedly increasing taxes on tobacco products. At UHCC the U54 has resulted in increased cancer health disparities research in Pacific Islanders. In this U54 renewal application, our overarching goal is to establish our Partner- ship as the national and international leader in advancing cancer health equity in Pacific Islanders. To achieve this goal we will build upon the success of the last five and a half years. All Specific Aims of the individual components of our application support our overall objectives, namely 1) to continue to develop the cancer re- search capability and competitiveness of faculty at UOG by increasing the number of UOG faculty with investigator-initiated funding and peer-reviewed publications; 2) to further develop the focus of UHCC research on cancer health disparities, with particular emphasis on Pacific Islanders and related topics of regional relevance such as betel nut chewing and cervical cancer screening and prevention; 3) To continue raising the awareness of cancer and cancer prevention in the multiethnic communities served by UOG and UHCC, with emphasis on Pacific Islanders; and 4) to increase the number of cancer and biomedical science researchers of Pacific Is- lander ancestry in the U.S. by continuing our successful MA, MS, and PhD training programs for Pacific Is- lander students in cancer-related fields, as well as providing guidance to early stage faculty investigators. The leadership at UOG and UHCC are highly committed to this Partnership as evidenced by their strong Letters of Support and the commitment of significant resources to the Partnership. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative:  This grant has supported the only cancer research infrastructure established west of Hawaii, in the U.S. Territory of Guam. Continued funding will support three research projects described herein, focusing on cancers of regional significance.

"2/2 Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: an SCC-SIUSM Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Low-income rural communities experience significant cancer health disparities, including lower screening rates, increased incidence, and later stage at detection, poorer survival, and higher mortality. The Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSM) and its Simmons Cancer Institute serve much of the central rural, southern rural, and Delta regions of Illinois. These rural communities have higher poverty rates and are medically underserved with disparately high cancer burden. SIUSM has established a partnership with the NCI-designated Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) at Washington University in Saint Louis (WUSTL), and SCC's Prevention and Control Program, entitled, Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: An SCC-SIUSM PARTNERSHIP. To prepare for this application, we initiated planning activities in summer 2013. These collaborative planning activities included shared discussions, bi-monthly executive conference calls, in-person meetings at both sites, and early collaborative research efforts between SCC and SIUSM investigators. An Internal Advisory Committee comprised of representatives from each institution and key stakeholders from the region was formed and active in planning this application. The partnership goals are to: 1) build SIUSM cancer research capacity and support SIUSM faculty in transitioning to NIH-funded cancer disparities research, 2) provide opportunities for mid- and senior-level investigators to engage in cross- institutional cancer research and increase the rural cancer research scope and capacity at SCC, and 3) foster the development of post- doctoral scholars and junior faculty at both institutions to develop independent researchers in cancer disparities research. We will use three strategies to achieve these goals: First, a newly developed Pilot Research Program now allows junior investigators to gain research seed funding, collaborative experience and preliminary data for future NIH grants. This growing program prompted by this NCI PAR has already funded one on-going collaborative pilot, and another pilot is included in this application. Second, SCC will provide SIUSM faculty and trainees with access to research seminars and other training opportunities at SCC, and offer short-term investigator exchange programs. Third, building on career development activities ongoing at SCC, the two institutions will share strategies for faculty early career development. In particular, WUSTL's Division of Public Health Sciences offers a 10-month Master's degree in Population Health Science. We will identify clinician-scientists at SIUSM who want to build these research skills through coursework. We envision that these training activities may grow into an R25E or T32 application for rural cancer disparities research. Building on and leveraging the world-class cancer research and training programs at SCC and its Division of Public Health Science, and the rurally-focused mission of SIUSM and its commitment to develop population health science research, this Partnership will provide an important avenue for training and supporting a cadre of basic, clinical and population-based scientists at SIUSM with a focus on alleviating rural cancer disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative (Overall) The overall goal is to establish a highly integrated research and training collaboration focused on rural cancer health disparities between Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSM), an institution that serves the population of Downstate Illinois, a largely rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged region with significant cancer health disparities, and the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University in St. Louis (SCC- WUSTL), an NCI-designated Cancer Center. The Partnership will build SIUSM's research capacity and success conducting NIH-funded cancer disparity research, while also enhancing SCC's rural cancer awareness, research and reach. By doing so, the Partnership will contribute to reducing the cancer health disparities that persist in rural populations.",2/2 Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: an SCC-SIUSM Partnership,9142296,P20CA192966,"['Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Seeds ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' falls ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Rural Community ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Saints ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Rivers ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Training and Education ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' career development ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', "" Master's Degree "", ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' investigator training ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,P20,2016,210523,-0.021026175122382623
"2/2 NCCU-DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership ABSTRACT The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) – DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership (NCCU-DCI-CDTRP) is focused on developing infrastructure for translational cancer health disparities research, education and training and on performing two such pilot research projects, focusing on the molecular aspects underlying the increased lethality of prostate and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans, with direct application to prevention, detection and treatment. This Program is built on the long-standing relationship between the two Durham-based Institutions, less than four miles apart. NCCU is an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students (ISUPS), affiliated with the 17- member University of North Carolina system and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center (CC). The Partnership, focusing on translational cancer health disparities research and education and training of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage investigators (ESIs) in this field, which is described by the NIH Translational Research Working Group, will distinguish itself with synergistic complementarity to an existing U54 between NCCU and UNC, which focuses on sociocultural disparities research and education and training of undergraduate students. To this Partnership, the Biomanufacturing Research Institute and Technology Enterprise (BRITE) faculty at NCCU will bring a unique perspective from an ISUPS, expertise in pharmaceuticals, drug discovery and development, as well as existing extensive health disparities education and training programs. The CC, DCI, will bring a unique distinguishing focus on biospecimen collection, correlative science in the context of clinical trials, development of racially diverse cancer patient-derived models and programs addressing minority accrual to treatment and biospecimen collection clinical trials. Development of the Partnership occurred and is continuing around planning and priority- setting stages, including selection of co-developed, collaborative pilot research projects and creation of a fully integrated, bi-directional, mutually beneficial Cancer Research Education Program (CREP). The Implementation stage will launch the pilot research projects, utilizing nearly 25 Shared Resources between NCCU and Duke, the CREP and the engagement of underserved minority populations across the region and state, with complementary existing programming mutually emanating from NCCU, which directly serves a minority community, and DCI's Office of Health Equity and Disparities. The Partnership will be led by an integrated Administrative Core of senior investigators who will serve as mentors to ESIs, rigorously addressing career development, to postdoctoral fellows and to graduate students and will include an extensive Evaluation Program for tracking impact and outcomes. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), an External Advisory Committee (EAC), focused solely on scientific guidance, and a Community Advisory Board (CAB). This NCI P20 collaborative partnership, “North Carolina Central University–Duke Cancer Institute Cancer Disparities Translational Research Program” (NCCU-DCI CDTRP), is relevant to cancer health disparities research, education and training. Regarding research, this application’s Pilot Projects focus on understanding and modulating molecular pathways in human tumors that contribute to the increased lethality of prostate cancer and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans. Elucidating these pathways will contribute to better prevention, detection and treatment of these cancers. The Administrative Core and aforementioned Pilot Projects will be done by DCI, a NCI- designated Cancer Center, and NCCU, an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students, in collaboration. Finally, a bi-directional Cancer Research Education Program is integrated to train the next generation of underserved and minority graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage faculty

"3/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding.

"2/2 SDSU/UCSD Cancer Center Comprehensive Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) OVERALL ABSTRACT: This application seeks funding to continue to support the SDSU/UCSD Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership. Our vision, consistent with that of the Comprehensive Partnership for the Advancement of Health Equity (CPACHE) program, is to continue to develop outstanding programs in research, research education, and community outreach in order to understand and address causes for cancer health disparities in our catchment areas of San Diego and Imperial counties, a region with a large and growing Hispanic/Latino population. As this population ages, the number of cancer cases is expected to grow. Addressing the existing gaps in research, education, and health care delivery in this ethnic group is a high priority of our Partnership, which leverages th distinct yet complementary strengths and resources of San Diego State University (SDSU), an officially designated Hispanic Serving Institution, and the University of California (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center (MCC), an NCI-designated Cancer Center. The goal of our Partnership is to reduce the burden of cancer among Hispanic/Latino communities in our catchment area. We accomplish this by building research and research education capacity and by continuing to improve outreach and education to underserved communities in our area, with a special emphasis on Hispanic/Latinos. The PIs represent an outstanding multidisciplinary team of experienced researchers and academic leaders in their own areas. Consistent with the overall goals of the CPACHE program and taking advantage of unique and complementary resources at SDSU and UCSD, we have established an outstanding scientific and leadership team. The complement of two population scientists (Drs. E. Martinez and E. Arredondo), a physician scientist (Dr. S. Crowe), and a basic scientist (Dr. M. Sussman) makes for an outstanding synergistic scientific team. The application includes two Full and one Pilot Project which were selected for their strong hypothesis-driven research aimed at enhancing research capacity at SDSU and increasing cancer disparities research at UCSD. This is complemented by a new Research Education program aimed at providing research experience in cancer and cancer disparities to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups who will be largely Hispanic/Latino. Finally, the Outreach Core involves a unique triad partnership that includes the MCC, SDSU, and federally qualified community health centers that serve the majority of uninsured and Medicaid insured Hispanic/Latinos in a large metropolitan area and along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Partnership has strong institutional commitment, a comprehensive planning and evaluation plan, and the guidance of an outstanding Internal Advisory Board and a stellar Program Steering Committee. There is sound rationale for the continuation of our Partnership as it has and will continue to provide unique, significant, and impactful programs in cancer research, research education, and community outreach. Taken together, the new PI leadership has developed a strong renewal application that meets all the goals of the NCI U54 PACHE program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the application is to seek funding to continue to support the SDSU/UCSD Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership in order to continue to develop outstanding programs in research, research education, and community outreach to understand causes for cancer health disparities and to reduce the burden of cancer among Hispanic/Latino communities in our catchment areas of San Diego and Imperial counties.

"1/2 Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: An SCC-SIUSM Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Low-income rural communities experience significant cancer health disparities, including lower screening rates, increased incidence, and later stage at detection, poorer survival, and higher mortality. The Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSM) and its Simmons Cancer Institute serve much of the central rural, southern rural, and Delta regions of Illinois. These rural communities have higher poverty rates and are medically underserved with disparately high cancer burden. SIUSM has established a partnership with the NCI-designated Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) at Washington University in Saint Louis (WUSTL), and SCC's Prevention and Control Program, entitled, Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: An SCC-SIUSM PARTNERSHIP. To prepare for this application, we initiated planning activities in summer 2013. These collaborative planning activities included shared discussions, bi-monthly executive conference calls, in-person meetings at both sites, and early collaborative research efforts between SCC and SIUSM investigators. An Internal Advisory Committee comprised of representatives from each institution and key stakeholders from the region was formed and active in planning this application. The partnership goals are to: 1) build SIUSM cancer research capacity and support SIUSM faculty in transitioning to NIH-funded cancer disparities research, 2) provide opportunities for mid- and senior-level investigators to engage in cross- institutional cancer research and increase the rural cancer research scope and capacity at SCC, and 3) foster the development of post- doctoral scholars and junior faculty at both institutions to develop independent researchers in cancer disparities research. We will use three strategies to achieve these goals: First, a newly developed Pilot Research Program now allows junior investigators to gain research seed funding, collaborative experience and preliminary data for future NIH grants. This growing program prompted by this NCI PAR has already funded one on-going collaborative pilot, and another pilot is included in this application. Second, SCC will provide SIUSM faculty and trainees with access to research seminars and other training opportunities at SCC, and offer short-term investigator exchange programs. Third, building on career development activities ongoing at SCC, the two institutions will share strategies for faculty early career development. In particular, WUSTL's Division of Public Health Sciences offers a 10-month Master's degree in Population Health Science. We will identify clinician-scientists at SIUSM who want to build these research skills through coursework. We envision that these training activities may grow into an R25E or T32 application for rural cancer disparities research. Building on and leveraging the world-class cancer research and training programs at SCC and its Division of Public Health Science, and the rurally-focused mission of SIUSM and its commitment to develop population health science research, this Partnership will provide an important avenue for training and supporting a cadre of basic, clinical and population-based scientists at SIUSM with a focus on alleviating rural cancer disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative (Overall) The overall goal is to establish a highly integrated research and training collaboration focused on rural cancer health disparities between Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSM), an institution that serves the population of Downstate Illinois, a largely rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged region with significant cancer health disparities, and the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University in St. Louis (SCC- WUSTL), an NCI-designated Cancer Center. The Partnership will build SIUSM's research capacity and success conducting NIH-funded cancer disparity research, while also enhancing SCC's rural cancer awareness, research and reach. By doing so, the Partnership will contribute to reducing the cancer health disparities that persist in rural populations.",1/2 Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: An SCC-SIUSM Partnership,9140061,P20CA192987,"['Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Seeds ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' falls ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Rural Community ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Saints ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Rivers ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Training and Education ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' career development ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', "" Master's Degree "", ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' investigator training ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' ']",NCI,SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY SCH OF MED,P20,2016,230415,-0.021026175122382623
"1/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Individuals from underserved minority communities in the U.S. experience poor outcomes for the majority of cancers as a result of inequities in access to high quality healthcare, socio-cultural and environmental determinants, and in some cases behavioral and biologic factors. Inequities in cancer outcomes are rooted in a wide range of structural, socio-cultural, and policy-related determinants that are operative throughout the U.S., but local factors can perpetuate and influence the magnitude of disparate cancer outcomes. To some extent, high cancer mortality among racial and ethnic minority segments of the population is a national manifestation of a wide range of local problems. A promising strategy to address cancer disparities is to foster research to understand local patterns of cancer mortality and root causes of disparities, and to test interventions informed by those findings that account for the needs of the local community. This paradigm for addressing cancer disparities has been successfully employed by a large cadre of cancer researchers at the University of Illinois Cancer Center (UICC) for more than a decade and forms the basis of the UICC vision to be a “bench- to-community” NCI-designated cancer center. Governors State University (GSU) has invested substantially in basic science and health science infrastructure, increased efforts to recruit faculty members with an interest in research, and significantly enhanced research support services over the past several years. As a result, GSU is positioned to address growing cancer disparities in their community. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop additional infrastructure that will build on the strengths of the partnering institutions in order to enhance their capacity to conduct cancer health inequities research that is driven by local data and informed by the cancer-related needs of local communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE (OVERALL): The GUIDE (GSU-UICC-Disparities-Education) Cancer Research Training Project is a collaborative initiative between GSU and UICC. The institutions will jointly conduct a pilot research project addressing a local, cancer-related health disparity and will develop a training program for GSU junior faculty and undergraduate students designed to attract and prepare investigators for careers in cancer disparities.",1/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project,9148256,P20CA202908,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentors ', ' mortality ', ' Peer Review ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' science education ', ' member ', ' Funding Source ', ' Funding Agency ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Localized Malignancy ', ' Localized Cancer ', ' Local Cancer ', ' Localized Malignant Neoplasm ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' UICC ', ' International Union Against Cancer ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' R21 Award ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' undergraduate student ', ' summer research ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority investigator ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,P20,2016,274309,-0.012545005370573833
"1/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding.

"(1/2) Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership The Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU) and the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) have forged a strong working relationship founded on seamless communication with mutual support and benefits. With Partnership resources and significant commitment from both institutions, we have established joint programs enhancing basic and clinical research, enriching cancer outreach, expanding cancer education, and creating a unique Hispanic/Latino (H/L) Biobank, leading to the development of a robust network and infrastructure necessary for a sustained long-term collaboration to improve cancer outcomes in the H/L population. The U54 Partnership's immediate impact includes the identification of new mutations in breast and lung cancer in H/L patients, recruitment of new faculty essential for sustainability and growth, and 84 community outreach educational activities for H/Ls in Florida (FL) and Puerto Rico (PR). The development of the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB) and the training of clinical researchers, with 25 clinical intervention trials activated in Ponce, demonstrate the broad impact realized through the Partnership. Furthermore the Partnership had a critical role in the ACGME re-accreditation of the Hematology/Oncology Fellowship in PR, in the establishment of two stem cell transplant programs in PR by fellows trained in the MCC Bone Marrow Transplant unit, and in the establishment of an ACGME-accredited surgical residency in Ponce with surgical oncology rotations at MCC. The short-term metrics of the first 4 years of the U54 Partnership grant include 48 student participants, 35 peer-reviewed manuscripts published, and 29 grants funded out of a total of 64 submitted.  Our vision for the U54 PACHE renewal is to further grow and engage faculty and students in cancer precision medicine research that directly impacts the H/L populations in FL and PR. The Partnership has the requisite components to fully execute precision medicine in an underserved population—a biobank, quantitative science core (QSC) to analyze data, culturally sensitive outreach materials, expertise in the latest technologies, and a robust research portfolio. The four specific aims for the U54 Partnership renewal are the following. Aim 1: To increase the number of researchers at PHSU focused on basic/translational research in cancer and to augment the number of researchers in cancer health disparities at MCC. This is facilitated with joint projects in ovarian and breast cancer. Aim 2: To further develop outreach programs and research efforts in the H/L communities at both PHSU and MCC. An epidemiological project will examine the impact of receipt of MC1R genotypes on personal sun protection behaviors. Aim 3: To increase support for basic, translational and clinical research in the H/L population by establishing the QSC and further developing the PRBB. The MCC Total Cancer Care protocol will be developed in Ponce hospitals and leveraged by the PRBB to facilitate tissue collection. Aim 4: To provide comprehensive and structured student research education at both PHSU and MCC to facilitate the expansion and success of cancer researchers and clinicians in the H/L population. Over the last 10 years, the Ponce Health Sciences University in Puerto Rico and the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida have developed an exceptionally strong working relationship facilitated by the U56 Partnership Planning and U54 PACHE Comprehensive Partnership awards. The joint programs have resulted in successful outcomes in basic, translational, population and clinical research, as well as in cancer outreach, cancer education and training, and in biobanking. During the U54 Partnership renewal period there will be a focus on precision cancer medicine to address disparities regarding the representation of Hispanic/Latino populations in biorepositories and databases, and the “omics” analyses of tumor and normal tissues from this underrepresented group.",(1/2) Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership,9419228,U54CA163071,"['Accreditation ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Educational Activities ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Florida ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hematology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Island ', ' Joints ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rotation ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Talents ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Peer Review Grants ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer care ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Stem cell transplant ', ' Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Progenitor Cell Transplantation ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Grant Review ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Surgical Oncology ', ' oncologic surgery ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Outreach Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' sun protection ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' tumor ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision oncology ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' personalized oncology ', ' education research ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' ']",NCI,PONCE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2017,1763439,-0.048099802109092905
"2/2 NCCU-DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership ABSTRACT The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) – DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership (NCCU-DCI-CDTRP) is focused on developing infrastructure for translational cancer health disparities research, education and training and on performing two such pilot research projects, focusing on the molecular aspects underlying the increased lethality of prostate and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans, with direct application to prevention, detection and treatment. This Program is built on the long-standing relationship between the two Durham-based Institutions, less than four miles apart. NCCU is an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students (ISUPS), affiliated with the 17- member University of North Carolina system and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center (CC). The Partnership, focusing on translational cancer health disparities research and education and training of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage investigators (ESIs) in this field, which is described by the NIH Translational Research Working Group, will distinguish itself with synergistic complementarity to an existing U54 between NCCU and UNC, which focuses on sociocultural disparities research and education and training of undergraduate students. To this Partnership, the Biomanufacturing Research Institute and Technology Enterprise (BRITE) faculty at NCCU will bring a unique perspective from an ISUPS, expertise in pharmaceuticals, drug discovery and development, as well as existing extensive health disparities education and training programs. The CC, DCI, will bring a unique distinguishing focus on biospecimen collection, correlative science in the context of clinical trials, development of racially diverse cancer patient-derived models and programs addressing minority accrual to treatment and biospecimen collection clinical trials. Development of the Partnership occurred and is continuing around planning and priority- setting stages, including selection of co-developed, collaborative pilot research projects and creation of a fully integrated, bi-directional, mutually beneficial Cancer Research Education Program (CREP). The Implementation stage will launch the pilot research projects, utilizing nearly 25 Shared Resources between NCCU and Duke, the CREP and the engagement of underserved minority populations across the region and state, with complementary existing programming mutually emanating from NCCU, which directly serves a minority community, and DCI's Office of Health Equity and Disparities. The Partnership will be led by an integrated Administrative Core of senior investigators who will serve as mentors to ESIs, rigorously addressing career development, to postdoctoral fellows and to graduate students and will include an extensive Evaluation Program for tracking impact and outcomes. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), an External Advisory Committee (EAC), focused solely on scientific guidance, and a Community Advisory Board (CAB). This NCI P20 collaborative partnership, “North Carolina Central University–Duke Cancer Institute Cancer Disparities Translational Research Program” (NCCU-DCI CDTRP), is relevant to cancer health disparities research, education and training. Regarding research, this application’s Pilot Projects focus on understanding and modulating molecular pathways in human tumors that contribute to the increased lethality of prostate cancer and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans. Elucidating these pathways will contribute to better prevention, detection and treatment of these cancers. The Administrative Core and aforementioned Pilot Projects will be done by DCI, a NCI- designated Cancer Center, and NCCU, an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students, in collaboration. Finally, a bi-directional Cancer Research Education Program is integrated to train the next generation of underserved and minority graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage faculty

"2/2 Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: an SCC-SIUSM Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Low-income rural communities experience significant cancer health disparities, including lower screening rates, increased incidence, and later stage at detection, poorer survival, and higher mortality. The Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSM) and its Simmons Cancer Institute serve much of the central rural, southern rural, and Delta regions of Illinois. These rural communities have higher poverty rates and are medically underserved with disparately high cancer burden. SIUSM has established a partnership with the NCI-designated Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) at Washington University in Saint Louis (WUSTL), and SCC's Prevention and Control Program, entitled, Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: An SCC-SIUSM PARTNERSHIP. To prepare for this application, we initiated planning activities in summer 2013. These collaborative planning activities included shared discussions, bi-monthly executive conference calls, in-person meetings at both sites, and early collaborative research efforts between SCC and SIUSM investigators. An Internal Advisory Committee comprised of representatives from each institution and key stakeholders from the region was formed and active in planning this application. The partnership goals are to: 1) build SIUSM cancer research capacity and support SIUSM faculty in transitioning to NIH-funded cancer disparities research, 2) provide opportunities for mid- and senior-level investigators to engage in cross- institutional cancer research and increase the rural cancer research scope and capacity at SCC, and 3) foster the development of post- doctoral scholars and junior faculty at both institutions to develop independent researchers in cancer disparities research. We will use three strategies to achieve these goals: First, a newly developed Pilot Research Program now allows junior investigators to gain research seed funding, collaborative experience and preliminary data for future NIH grants. This growing program prompted by this NCI PAR has already funded one on-going collaborative pilot, and another pilot is included in this application. Second, SCC will provide SIUSM faculty and trainees with access to research seminars and other training opportunities at SCC, and offer short-term investigator exchange programs. Third, building on career development activities ongoing at SCC, the two institutions will share strategies for faculty early career development. In particular, WUSTL's Division of Public Health Sciences offers a 10-month Master's degree in Population Health Science. We will identify clinician-scientists at SIUSM who want to build these research skills through coursework. We envision that these training activities may grow into an R25E or T32 application for rural cancer disparities research. Building on and leveraging the world-class cancer research and training programs at SCC and its Division of Public Health Science, and the rurally-focused mission of SIUSM and its commitment to develop population health science research, this Partnership will provide an important avenue for training and supporting a cadre of basic, clinical and population-based scientists at SIUSM with a focus on alleviating rural cancer disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative (Overall) The overall goal is to establish a highly integrated research and training collaboration focused on rural cancer health disparities between Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSM), an institution that serves the population of Downstate Illinois, a largely rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged region with significant cancer health disparities, and the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University in St. Louis (SCC- WUSTL), an NCI-designated Cancer Center. The Partnership will build SIUSM's research capacity and success conducting NIH-funded cancer disparity research, while also enhancing SCC's rural cancer awareness, research and reach. By doing so, the Partnership will contribute to reducing the cancer health disparities that persist in rural populations.",2/2 Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: an SCC-SIUSM Partnership,9345317,P20CA192966,"['Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Seeds ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' falls ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Rural Community ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Saints ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Rivers ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' career development ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Health Sciences ', "" Master's Degree "", ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' investigator training ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' early-career faculty ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' rural underserved ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,P20,2017,219179,-0.021026175122382623
"2/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE        Project Narrative: The presence of major cancer health inequities in Chicago is well-documented. This proposed 3 institutional partnership poses a strong and important approach for reducing deeply-engrained disparities. CCPACHE is a partnership in research, education, and community outreach aimed directly at building and fostering the next generation pipeline of students and faculty entering health-related careers, increasing the number of cancer health disparities researchers, and facilitating the translation of cancer research that is directly informed by, and relevant to, Chicagoland communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",2/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity,9333291,U54CA202995,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Mission ', ' Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' forging ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' under-represented student ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' Minority Graduate Student ', ' minority graduate ', ' community center ', ' student training ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,U54,2017,863140,-0.016855895909280497
"2/2 Ponce School of Medicine-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU) and the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) have forged a strong working relationship founded on seamless communication with mutual support and benefits. With Partnership resources and significant commitment from both institutions, we have established joint programs enhancing basic and clinical research, enriching cancer outreach, expanding cancer education, and creating a unique Hispanic/Latino (H/L) Biobank, leading to the development of a robust network and infrastructure necessary for a sustained long-term collaboration to improve cancer outcomes in the H/L population. The U54 Partnership’s immediate impact includes the identification of new mutations in breast and lung cancer in H/L patients, recruitment of new faculty essential for sustainability and growth, and 84 community outreach educational activities for H/Ls in Florida (FL) and Puerto Rico (PR). The development of the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB) and the training of clinical researchers, with 25 clinical intervention trials activated in Ponce, demonstrate the broad impact realized through the Partnership. Furthermore the Partnership had a critical role in the ACGME re-accreditation of the Hematology/Oncology Fellowship in PR, in the establishment of two stem cell transplant programs in PR by fellows trained in the MCC Bone Marrow Transplant unit, and in the establishment of an ACGME-accredited surgical residency in Ponce with surgical oncology rotations at MCC. The short-term metrics of the first 4 years of the U54 Partnership grant include 48 student participants, 35 peer-reviewed manuscripts published, and 29 grants funded out of a total of 64 submitted.  Our vision for the U54 PACHE renewal is to further grow and engage faculty and students in cancer precision medicine research that directly impacts the H/L populations in FL and PR. The Partnership has the requisite components to fully execute precision medicine in an underserved population—a biobank, quantitative science core (QSC) to analyze data, culturally sensitive outreach materials, expertise in the latest technologies, and a robust research portfolio. The four specific aims for the U54 Partnership renewal are the following. Aim 1: To increase the number of researchers at PHSU focused on basic/translational research in cancer and to augment the number of researchers in cancer health disparities at MCC. This is facilitated with joint projects in ovarian and breast cancer. Aim 2: To further develop outreach programs and research efforts in the H/L communities at both PHSU and MCC. An epidemiological project will examine the impact of receipt of MC1R genotypes on personal sun protection behaviors. Aim 3: To increase support for basic, translational and clinical research in the H/L population by establishing the QSC and further developing the PRBB. The MCC Total Cancer Care protocol will be developed in Ponce hospitals and leveraged by the PRBB to facilitate tissue collection. Aim 4: To provide comprehensive and structured student research education at both PHSU and MCC to facilitate the expansion and success of cancer researchers and clinicians in the H/L population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the last 10 years, the Ponce Health Sciences University in Puerto Rico and the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida have developed an exceptionally strong working relationship facilitated by the U56 Partnership Planning and U54 PACHE Comprehensive Partnership awards. The joint programs have resulted in successful outcomes in basic, translational, population and clinical research, as well as in cancer outreach, cancer education and training, and in biobanking. During the U54 Partnership renewal period there will be a focus on precision cancer medicine to address disparities regarding the representation of Hispanic/Latino populations in biorepositories and databases, and the “omics” analyses of tumor and normal tissues from this underrepresented group.",2/2 Ponce School of Medicine-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership,9418969,U54CA163068,"['Accreditation ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Educational Activities ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Florida ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hematology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Island ', ' Joints ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rotation ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Talents ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Peer Review Grants ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer care ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Stem cell transplant ', ' Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Progenitor Cell Transplantation ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Grant Review ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Surgical Oncology ', ' oncologic surgery ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Outreach Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' sun protection ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' tumor ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision oncology ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' personalized oncology ', ' education research ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"1/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research Summary: The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) initiated their Partnership in August 2002. The early years of the Partnership during the U56 funding period (2005-2010) established the foundational support and scientific leadership needed to build a solid and vibrant research collaboration. Moving forward, the U54 mechanism drew on this foundation resulting in a robust set of activities in research, capacity building and outreach. Two key tenets guide this sustained partnership between UMass Boston and DF/HCC: a) A common and intense interest in addressing the problem of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality; and b) A belief that through the Partnership, each institution will achieve benefits that neither could achieve on its own. This application for renewal provides extensive evidence of the ways these tenets have been operationalized, the resulting benefits for both institutions and the ways in which this Partnership is now poised to make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control. We are proposing activities that draw on the latest science to understand and address cancer disparities through a transdisciplinary approach that embodies our Partnership theme of “Cells to Society.” In support of our new cohesive theme, we have proposed three sophisticated, highly competitive research projects across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. To elucidate new areas of research opportunity, the Partnership is excited to explore the intersection between biology-based sciences and social/behavioral sciences. The immediate priorities of the Partnership are: 1) Continuing capacity building for biomedical and cancer research at UMass Boston and cancer disparities research at DF/HCC; 2) Enhancing and scaling up research experiences for students with a specific focus on underrepresented minorities (URMs), across the entire educational pipeline –from undergraduate to postdoctoral levels (see Research Education Core); 3) Continuing close mentoring of early stage investigators with a focus on research and career development; 4) Building a strong and robust Outreach Core that draws on the state of the science from dissemination and implementation sciences (D&I) for building partnerships, translating knowledge and monitoring the results of the translation efforts to build and sustain capacity among community-based organizations (see Outreach Core); 5) Offering infrastructural support to U54 investigators through two service cores, including the Research Design and Analysis, and Genomics Cores (see Shared Resource Core); and 6) Ensuring sustainability for projects, Cores and research education programs via dedicated planning and execution of grant matching with NIH-mechanisms, foundation support and/or institutional support. Project Narrative: The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Partnership is committed to further developing a shared rigorous and collaborative transdisciplinary cancer and disparities-related research program that spans the continuum of “Cells to Society.” Sophisticated research projects are proposed across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. These projects, together with state-of-the-art Outreach and Research Education Cores and creative Research Design and Analysis and Genomics Shared Resources, will serve to build research capacity and infrastructure at UMass Boston, expand the cancer disparities platform and community outreach programs at DF/HCC; and make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control.","1/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research",9355104,U54CA156734,"['Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Boston ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Ramp ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' novel ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' Genomics ', ' statistical service ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Genomics Shared Resource ', ' Outreach Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' scale up ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' implementation science ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' personalized cancer therapy ', ' personalized cancer treatment ', ' individualized cancer therapy ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' education research ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,U54,2017,2032734,-0.03195902260653191
"CBPR:  Enhancing Capacity to Use Innovative Methodologies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for the use of innovative methodologies in the behavioral and social sciences has been widely noted. The past two decades have seen continued recognition that more innovative and community-engaged approaches to research and interventions are needed to address the social and environmental determinants of population health and more specifically racial and ethnic inequities in health. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is one such approach to community-engaged research. Increased funding support for CBPR is in keeping with the mission statement of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the research capacity- building priorities delineated in the NIH Health Disparities Strategic Plan 2009-2013, and select research goals of the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR). As the need for and opportunities to expand CBPR increases, so does the need to enhance capacity in innovative methods for researchers conducting behavioral and social sciences research (BSSR) to use this approach. Not only is CBPR an innovative approach in and of itself for many researchers conducting BSSR, there are also several specific innovations within the context of a CBPR approach that are particularly relevant to the mission of NIH. These innovative methods include the integrated use of mixed methods (combining qualitative and quantitative methods), and innovative research designs that complement randomized controlled designs. Although numerous educational materials on CBPR have been developed in recent years, there are few opportunities for both early-career and established researchers to engage in a co-learning process facilitated by experienced academic-community faculty teams. Further, there is a need to promote the diversity of the BSSR workforce, including increasing participation of researchers from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Thus, the overarching goal of the proposed research education program, Community-Based Participatory Research: Enhancing Capacity to Use Innovative Methodologies in the Behavioral and Social Sciences (the Enhance Program), is to enhance knowledge and skills in the use of innovative methodologies in CBPR, in partnership with the communities involved, to examine and address health inequities. The proposed Enhance Program will be carried out by the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center (Detroit URC), a CBPR partnership established in 1995 to understand and address factors that contribute to health inequities in Detroit. The two- pronged approach of the Enhance Program is: 1) to develop, implement, and evaluate an intensive short course in innovative methodologies in CBPR for conducting behavioral and social sciences research; and 2) to enhance and integrate learning from the short course through a series of follow-on educational activities, an applied CBPR project, mentoring, and development of a network of diverse scholars for career development and innovation in BSSR using a CBPR approach to promote health equity. An evaluation will be conducted to assess and enhance program effectiveness. The curriculum and other materials will be widely disseminated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To solve complex public health problems, community-based participatory research (CBPR), a collaborative, participatory approach between academic and community partners is particularly effective. CBPR is an innovative approach for researchers conducting behavioral and social sciences research and numerous innovative methods are relevant within this approach.

"1/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Individuals from underserved minority communities in the U.S. experience poor outcomes for the majority of cancers as a result of inequities in access to high quality healthcare, socio-cultural and environmental determinants, and in some cases behavioral and biologic factors. Inequities in cancer outcomes are rooted in a wide range of structural, socio-cultural, and policy-related determinants that are operative throughout the U.S., but local factors can perpetuate and influence the magnitude of disparate cancer outcomes. To some extent, high cancer mortality among racial and ethnic minority segments of the population is a national manifestation of a wide range of local problems. A promising strategy to address cancer disparities is to foster research to understand local patterns of cancer mortality and root causes of disparities, and to test interventions informed by those findings that account for the needs of the local community. This paradigm for addressing cancer disparities has been successfully employed by a large cadre of cancer researchers at the University of Illinois Cancer Center (UICC) for more than a decade and forms the basis of the UICC vision to be a “bench- to-community” NCI-designated cancer center. Governors State University (GSU) has invested substantially in basic science and health science infrastructure, increased efforts to recruit faculty members with an interest in research, and significantly enhanced research support services over the past several years. As a result, GSU is positioned to address growing cancer disparities in their community. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop additional infrastructure that will build on the strengths of the partnering institutions in order to enhance their capacity to conduct cancer health inequities research that is driven by local data and informed by the cancer-related needs of local communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE (OVERALL): The GUIDE (GSU-UICC-Disparities-Education) Cancer Research Training Project is a collaborative initiative between GSU and UICC. The institutions will jointly conduct a pilot research project addressing a local, cancer-related health disparity and will develop a training program for GSU junior faculty and undergraduate students designed to attract and prepare investigators for careers in cancer disparities.",1/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project,9335797,P20CA202908,"['Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentors ', ' mortality ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' science education ', ' member ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' research study ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Localized Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Localized Malignancy ', ' Localized Cancer ', ' Local Cancer ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' R21 Award ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' recruit teachers ', ' summer research ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority investigator ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' racial minority ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,P20,2017,224261,-0.012545005370573833
"(1/2) University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Project Summary/Abstract: Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry is a highly underserved minority with a significant, disparate burden of cancer. In addition, they are also highly underrepresented among cancer researchers and cancer health care professionals. The University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) have been engaged in a unique and successful partnership over the past twelve years, currently supported by a U54 grant. As the only U54 Partnership addressing cancer health disparities in Pacific Islanders, the UOG/UHCC Partnership is characterized by a significant number of very distinctive aspects and opportunities. In particular, 37% of the Guam population is represented by indigenous Chamorros/part-Chamorros, while 38% are Filipino and Micronesian. The unique ethnic characteristics of this UOG/UHCC Partnership are paralleled by its unique geographic characteristics (the region covered by HI, GU, and U.S. Pacific Territories/jurisdictions), as well as unique regional opportunities for research, education, and outreach. The UOG/UHCC Partnership has indeed been transformational for the UOG and the Territory of Guam as specified in UOG's Letter of Commitment, including the establishment of a Cancer Research Center at UOG and implementation of legislation markedly increasing taxes on tobacco products. At UHCC the U54 has resulted in increased cancer health disparities research in Pacific Islanders. In this U54 renewal application, our overarching goal is to establish our Partner- ship as the national and international leader in advancing cancer health equity in Pacific Islanders. To achieve this goal we will build upon the success of the last five and a half years. All Specific Aims of the individual components of our application support our overall objectives, namely 1) to continue to develop the cancer re- search capability and competitiveness of faculty at UOG by increasing the number of UOG faculty with investigator-initiated funding and peer-reviewed publications; 2) to further develop the focus of UHCC research on cancer health disparities, with particular emphasis on Pacific Islanders and related topics of regional relevance such as betel nut chewing and cervical cancer screening and prevention; 3) To continue raising the awareness of cancer and cancer prevention in the multiethnic communities served by UOG and UHCC, with emphasis on Pacific Islanders; and 4) to increase the number of cancer and biomedical science researchers of Pacific Is- lander ancestry in the U.S. by continuing our successful MA, MS, and PhD training programs for Pacific Is- lander students in cancer-related fields, as well as providing guidance to early stage faculty investigators. The leadership at UOG and UHCC are highly committed to this Partnership as evidenced by their strong Letters of Support and the commitment of significant resources to the Partnership. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative:  This grant has supported the only cancer research infrastructure established west of Hawaii, in the U.S. Territory of Guam.

"1/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding.

"2/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) initiated their Partnership in August 2002. The early years of the Partnership during the U56 funding period (2005-2010) established the foundational support and scientific leadership needed to build a solid and vibrant research collaboration. Moving forward, the U54 mechanism drew on this foundation resulting in a robust set of activities in research, capacity building and outreach. Two key tenets guide this sustained partnership between UMass Boston and DF/HCC: a) A common and intense interest in addressing the problem of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality; and b) A belief that through the Partnership, each institution will achieve benefits that neither could achieve on its own. This application for renewal provides extensive evidence of the ways these tenets have been operationalized, the resulting benefits for both institutions and the ways in which this Partnership is now poised to make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control. We are proposing activities that draw on the latest science to understand and address cancer disparities through a transdisciplinary approach that embodies our Partnership theme of “Cells to Society. In support of our new cohesive theme, we have proposed three sophisticated, highly competitive research projects across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. To elucidate new areas of research opportunity, the Partnership is excited to explore the intersection between biology-based sciences and social/behavioral sciences. The immediate priorities Summary: ” of the Partnership are: 1) Continuing capacity building for biomedical and cancer research at UMass Boston and cancer disparities research at DF/HCC; 2) Enhancing and scaling up research experiences for students with a specific focus on underrepresented minorities (URMs), across the entire educational pipeline –from undergraduate to postdoctoral levels (see Research Education Core); 3) Continuing close mentoring of early stage investigators with a focus on research and career development; 4) Building a strong and robust Outreach Core that draws on the state of the science from dissemination and implementation sciences (D&I) for building partnerships, translating knowledge and monitoring the results of the translation efforts to build and sustain capacity among community-based organizations (see Outreach Core); 5) Offering infrastructural support to U54 investigators through two service cores, including the Research Design and Analysis, and Genomics Cores (see Shared Resource Core); and 6) Ensuring sustainability for projects, Cores and research education programs via dedicated planning and execution of grant matching with NIH-mechanisms, foundation support and/or institutional support. Project Narrative: The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Partnership is committed to further developing a shared rigorous and collaborative transdisciplinary cancer and disparities-related research program that spans the continuum of “Cells to Society.” Sophisticated research projects are proposed across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. These projects, together with state-of-the-art Outreach and Research Education Cores and creative Research Design and Analysis and Genomics Shared Resources, will serve to build research capacity and infrastructure at UMass Boston, expand the cancer disparities platform and community outreach programs at DF/HCC; and make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control.","2/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research",9355103,U54CA156732,"['Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Boston ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Ramp ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' novel ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' Genomics ', ' statistical service ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Genomics Shared Resource ', ' Outreach Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' scale up ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' implementation science ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' personalized cancer therapy ', ' personalized cancer treatment ', ' individualized cancer therapy ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' education research ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,U54,2017,2050210,-0.03162028340132182
"3/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE        Project Narrative: The presence of major cancer health inequities in Chicago is well-documented. This proposed 3 institutional partnership poses a strong and important approach for reducing deeply-engrained disparities. CCPACHE is a partnership in research, education, and community outreach aimed directly at building and fostering the next generation pipeline of students and faculty entering health-related careers, increasing the number of cancer health disparities researchers, and facilitating the translation of cancer research that is directly informed by, and relevant to, Chicagoland communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",3/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity,9335811,U54CA202997,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Mission ', ' Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' forging ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' under-represented student ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' Minority Graduate Student ', ' minority graduate ', ' community center ', ' student training ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U54,2017,1323291,-0.016855895909280497

This region has several growing racial/ethnic minority populations. After Hurricane Katrina, the Hispanic population in Louisiana doubled and is now the fastest growing ethnic minority. MCC is located in Tampa, Florida and serves an increasingly wide catchment area characterized by a population diverse in regard to age, race/ethnicity, language and literacy, and is home to an increasing Latino population. Precision medicine research requires: a well-managed, ethnically and racially diverse biospecimen repository; state of the art technology in genomics, epigenomics and ancestry analysis; availability of language, cultural and literacy specific educational tools and resources; and a research education infrastructure that promotes a pipeline of trainees in cancer disparities research. MCC is a national leader and pioneer in these areas, has highly integrated research programs, and seeks to expand the diversity of their biospecimen research endeavors. This partnership is based on two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Plan and execute two collaborative pilot research projects. The first pilot research project focuses on breast cancer genomics, studying biospecimens from Hispanic/Latina patients of mixed genetic ancestry (African, Native American, European) by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and methylation analysis, to study correlations between molecular subtypes, gene expression profiles, clinical outcomes and ancestry. This project will support the career development of racial/ethnic minority early-stage investigators at LSUHSC and MCC. Specific Aim 2: Plan a collaborative three-pronged cancer research education program that includes: 1) a hands-on summer research experience for undergraduate and medical students; 2) delivery of a curriculum to those students focusing on biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities; and 3) expansion of outreach education to our respective communities about biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities. The combination of these collaborative partnership activities is expected to offer mutual benefit to each institution to impact cancer health disparities, inspire the next generation of researchers, and rapidly lead to the submission of competitive grant applications. Importantly, our main collaborative goal is to bring the benefits of cancer research advancements to underserved communities.

"Is Assimilation Costing Asian Americans Their Health? Type 2 Diabetes in California's Asian American Populations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The diabetes rates for Asian Americans has been increasing over the last twenty years, with over 1 out of 5 Asian Americans having diabetes, almost twice the rates to their White counterparts (11.3%) (Lee et al., 2011; Menke, Casagrande, Geiss, & Cowie, 2015). The diabetes prevalence for Asians living in the U.S. are higher than those individuals living in their countries of origin (Fujimoto et al. 2012; Stewart 2016 et al.), and these vary widely by ethnic subgroup (Kanaya, 2010; Wang et al. 2011; Stewart et al 2016). We know little about what are the causes of these health disparities, and why the rates of the immigrants and the growing second generation are more at risk than in their respective Asian countries. Together, these observations suggest that assimilation, or the process of becoming American, may be putting immigrant minority groups, especially at risk for diabetes and other chronic diseases (Oza-Frank et al 2011; Popkin & Udry, 1998).  This mixed-method project examines the relationship between assimilation and diabetes prevalence in Asian American populations, using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Pooling data from years 2005- 2014 from the California Health Interview Survey, it examines the relationship between immigrant generation and type 2 diabetes, focusing on the top 6 Asian American ethnic groups in California. It also examines the extent acculturation and socioeconomic contextual factors might lead to differential risks for diabetes, while considering known risk factors. Partnering with the Los Angeles community-based organization, Asian Pacific Islanders Obesity Prevention Alliance (APIOPA), we supplement our quantitative findings with multilingual focus groups and interviews with Asian American from the different ethnic groups.  As one of the only research projects at our university to focus on Asian American health, the proposed project will provide a valuable opportunity for Asian American students to engage in research directly affecting their community as well as for other students with an interest in immigrant and minority health. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved throughout the project including concept development, developing multicultural competent measures for quantitative data analysis, interview-guide construction, manuscript writing, and skills for community-engaged research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the U.S., and the majority are immigrants or children of immigrants. Immigrants and their second-generation children now make up 81 million, or over 26 percent, of the overall U.S. population. By contributing to an understanding of the role of assimilation in diabetes, a preventable disease, this study will help inform further research and strategies for reducing diabetes and other health risks not just among Asian Americans but also among many of the nation's immigrant groups.",Is Assimilation Costing Asian Americans Their Health?

"2/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Individuals from underserved minority communities in the U.S. experience poor outcomes for the majority of cancers as a result of inequities in access to high quality healthcare, socio-cultural and environmental determinants, and in some cases behavioral and biologic factors. Inequities in cancer outcomes are rooted in a wide range of structural, socio-cultural, and policy-related determinants that are operative throughout the U.S., but local factors can perpetuate and influence the magnitude of disparate cancer outcomes. To some extent, high cancer mortality among racial and ethnic minority segments of the population is a national manifestation of a wide range of local problems. A promising strategy to address cancer disparities is to foster research to understand local patterns of cancer mortality and root causes of disparities, and to test interventions informed by those findings that account for the needs of the local community. This paradigm for addressing cancer disparities has been successfully employed by a large cadre of cancer researchers at the University of Illinois Cancer Center (UICC) for more than a decade and forms the basis of the UICC vision to be a “bench- to-community” NCI-designated cancer center. Governors State University (GSU) has invested substantially in basic science and health science infrastructure, increased efforts to recruit faculty members with an interest in research, and significantly enhanced research support services over the past several years. As a result, GSU is positioned to address growing cancer disparities in their community. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop additional infrastructure that will build on the strengths of the partnering institutions in order to enhance their capacity to conduct cancer health inequities research that is driven by local data and informed by the cancer-related needs of local communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE (OVERALL): The GUIDE (GSU-UICC-Disparities-Education) Cancer Research Training Project is a collaborative initiative between GSU and UICC. The institutions will jointly conduct a pilot research project addressing a local, cancer-related health disparity and will develop a training program for GSU junior faculty and undergraduate students designed to attract and prepare investigators for careers in cancer disparities.",2/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project,9379115,P20CA202907,"['Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentors ', ' mortality ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' science education ', ' member ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' research study ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Localized Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Localized Malignancy ', ' Localized Cancer ', ' Local Cancer ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' R21 Award ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' recruit teachers ', ' summer research ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority investigator ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' racial minority ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NCI,GOVERNORS STATE UNIVERSITY,P20,2017,52412,-0.012545005370573833
"2/2, University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry is a highly underserved minority with a significant, disparate burden of cancer. In addition, they are also highly underrepresented among cancer researchers and cancer health care professionals. The University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) have been engaged in a unique and successful partnership over the past twelve years, currently supported by a U54 grant. As the only U54 Partnership addressing cancer health disparities in Pacific Islanders, the UOG/UHCC Partnership is characterized by a significant number of very distinctive aspects and opportunities. In particular, 37% of the Guam population is represented by indigenous Chamorros/part-Chamorros, while 38% are Filipino and Micronesian. The unique ethnic characteristics of this UOG/UHCC Partnership are paralleled by its unique geographic characteristics (the region covered by HI, GU, and U.S. Pacific Territories/jurisdictions), as well as unique regional opportunities for research, education, and outreach. The UOG/UHCC Partnership has indeed been transformational for the UOG and the Territory of Guam as specified in UOG's Letter of Commitment, including the establishment of a Cancer Research Center at UOG and implementation of legislation markedly increasing taxes on tobacco products. At UHCC the U54 has resulted in increased cancer health disparities research in Pacific Islanders. In this U54 renewal application, our overarching goal is to establish our Partner- ship as the national and international leader in advancing cancer health equity in Pacific Islanders. To achieve this goal we will build upon the success of the last five and a half years. All Specific Aims of the individual components of our application support our overall objectives, namely 1) to continue to develop the cancer re- search capability and competitiveness of faculty at UOG by increasing the number of UOG faculty with investigator-initiated funding and peer-reviewed publications; 2) to further develop the focus of UHCC research on cancer health disparities, with particular emphasis on Pacific Islanders and related topics of regional relevance such as betel nut chewing and cervical cancer screening and prevention; 3) To continue raising the awareness of cancer and cancer prevention in the multiethnic communities served by UOG and UHCC, with emphasis on Pacific Islanders; and 4) to increase the number of cancer and biomedical science researchers of Pacific Is- lander ancestry in the U.S. by continuing our successful MA, MS, and PhD training programs for Pacific Is- lander students in cancer-related fields, as well as providing guidance to early stage faculty investigators. The leadership at UOG and UHCC are highly committed to this Partnership as evidenced by their strong Letters of Support and the commitment of significant resources to the Partnership. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This grant has supported the only cancer research infrastructure established west of Hawaii, in the U.S. Territory of Guam. Continued funding will support three research projects described herein, focusing on cancers of regional significance. The partnership provides opportunities for faculty as well as pre-doctoral and post-doctoral students to develop and strengthen skills in project design and administration, team collaboration, recruitment and retention, specimen collection, data analysis, manuscript writing, grantsmanship among others. Early stage and senior investigators at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center will gain opportunities to work with new populations in the Hawaii-Pacific region, including Chamorros, Chuukese and Marshallese, and establish collaborations with UOG faculty who share interests in cancer health disparities research.","2/2, University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership",9344546,U54CA143728,"['Accreditation ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Hawaii ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Mastication ', ' chews ', ' chewed ', ' Chewing ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Nuts ', ' Pacific Islands ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Taxes ', ' Tobacco ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' skills ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Indigenous ', ' International ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' CRCH ', ' Cancer Research Center of Hawaii ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Characteristics ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' doctoral student ', ' education research ', ' underserved minority ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF GUAM,U54,2017,943190,-0.004190922390270139

"1/2 NCCU-DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership ABSTRACT The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) – DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership (NCCU-DCI-CDTRP) is focused on developing infrastructure for translational cancer health disparities research, education and training and on performing two such pilot research projects, focusing on the molecular aspects underlying the increased lethality of prostate and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans, with direct application to prevention, detection and treatment. This Program is built on the long-standing relationship between the two Durham-based Institutions, less than four miles apart. NCCU is an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students (ISUPS), affiliated with the 17-member University of North Carolina system and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center (CC). The Partnership, focusing on translational cancer health disparities research and education and training of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage investigators (ESIs) in this field, which is described by the NIH Translational Research Working Group, will distinguish itself with synergistic complementarity to an existing U54 between NCCU and UNC, which focuses on sociocultural disparities research and education and training of undergraduate students. To this Partnership, the Biomanufacturing Research Institute and Technology Enterprise (BRITE) faculty at NCCU will bring a unique perspective from an ISUPS, expertise in pharmaceuticals, drug discovery and development, as well as existing extensive health disparities education and training programs. The CC, DCI, will bring a unique distinguishing focus on biospecimen collection, correlative science in the context of clinical trials, development of racially diverse cancer patient-derived models and programs addressing minority accrual to treatment and biospecimen collection clinical trials. Development of the Partnership occurred and is continuing around planning and priority-setting stages, including selection of co-developed, collaborative pilot research projects and creation of a fully integrated, bi-directional, mutually beneficial Cancer Research Education Program (CREP). The Implementation stage will launch the pilot research projects, utilizing nearly 25 Shared Resources between NCCU and Duke, the CREP and the engagement of underserved minority populations across the region and state, with complementary existing programming mutually emanating from NCCU, which directly serves a minority community, and DCI’s Office of Health Equity and Disparities. The Partnership will be led by an integrated Administrative Core of senior investigators who will serve as mentors to ESIs, rigorously addressing career development, to postdoctoral fellows and to graduate students and will include an extensive Evaluation Program for tracking impact and outcomes. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), an External Advisory Committee (EAC), focused solely on scientific guidance, and a Community Advisory Board (CAB). This NCI P20 collaborative partnership, “North Carolina Central University–Duke Cancer Institute Cancer Disparities Translational Research Program” (NCCU-DCI CDTRP), is relevant to cancer health disparities research, education and training. Regarding research, this application’s Pilot Projects focus on understanding and modulating molecular pathways in human tumors that contribute to the increased lethality of prostate cancer and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans. Elucidating these pathways will contribute to better prevention, detection and treatment of these cancers. The Administrative Core and aforementioned Pilot Projects will be done by DCI, a NCI- designated Cancer Center, and NCCU, an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students, in collaboration. Finally, a bi-directional Cancer Research Education Program is integrated to train the next generation of underserved and minority graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage faculty

"Improving Caregiver Health Literacy of Hispanic Cancer Patients Using a Dialogue System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE        Project Narrative: The presence of major cancer health inequities in Chicago is well-documented. This proposed 3 institutional partnership poses a strong and important approach for reducing deeply-engrained disparities. CCPACHE is a partnership in research, education, and community outreach aimed directly at building and fostering the next generation pipeline of students and faculty entering health-related careers, increasing the number of cancer health disparities researchers, and facilitating the translation of cancer research that is directly informed by, and relevant to, Chicagoland communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",Improving Caregiver Health Literacy of Hispanic Cancer Patients Using a Dialogue System,9677923,U54CA202995,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Mission ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' health literacy ', ' forging ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' under-represented student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' minority graduate ', ' Minority Graduate Student ', ' community center ', ' student training ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,U54,2018,162258,-0.0285732140313035

"(1/2) Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership The Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU) and the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) have forged a strong working relationship founded on seamless communication with mutual support and benefits. With Partnership resources and significant commitment from both institutions, we have established joint programs enhancing basic and clinical research, enriching cancer outreach, expanding cancer education, and creating a unique Hispanic/Latino (H/L) Biobank, leading to the development of a robust network and infrastructure necessary for a sustained long-term collaboration to improve cancer outcomes in the H/L population. The U54 Partnership's immediate impact includes the identification of new mutations in breast and lung cancer in H/L patients, recruitment of new faculty essential for sustainability and growth, and 84 community outreach educational activities for H/Ls in Florida (FL) and Puerto Rico (PR). The development of the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB) and the training of clinical researchers, with 25 clinical intervention trials activated in Ponce, demonstrate the broad impact realized through the Partnership. Furthermore the Partnership had a critical role in the ACGME re-accreditation of the Hematology/Oncology Fellowship in PR, in the establishment of two stem cell transplant programs in PR by fellows trained in the MCC Bone Marrow Transplant unit, and in the establishment of an ACGME-accredited surgical residency in Ponce with surgical oncology rotations at MCC. The short-term metrics of the first 4 years of the U54 Partnership grant include 48 student participants, 35 peer-reviewed manuscripts published, and 29 grants funded out of a total of 64 submitted.  Our vision for the U54 PACHE renewal is to further grow and engage faculty and students in cancer precision medicine research that directly impacts the H/L populations in FL and PR. The Partnership has the requisite components to fully execute precision medicine in an underserved population—a biobank, quantitative science core (QSC) to analyze data, culturally sensitive outreach materials, expertise in the latest technologies, and a robust research portfolio. The four specific aims for the U54 Partnership renewal are the following. Aim 1: To increase the number of researchers at PHSU focused on basic/translational research in cancer and to augment the number of researchers in cancer health disparities at MCC. This is facilitated with joint projects in ovarian and breast cancer. Aim 2: To further develop outreach programs and research efforts in the H/L communities at both PHSU and MCC. An epidemiological project will examine the impact of receipt of MC1R genotypes on personal sun protection behaviors. Aim 3: To increase support for basic, translational and clinical research in the H/L population by establishing the QSC and further developing the PRBB. The MCC Total Cancer Care protocol will be developed in Ponce hospitals and leveraged by the PRBB to facilitate tissue collection. Aim 4: To provide comprehensive and structured student research education at both PHSU and MCC to facilitate the expansion and success of cancer researchers and clinicians in the H/L population. Over the last 10 years, the Ponce Health Sciences University in Puerto Rico and the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida have developed an exceptionally strong working relationship facilitated by the U56 Partnership Planning and U54 PACHE Comprehensive Partnership awards. The joint programs have resulted in successful outcomes in basic, translational, population and clinical research, as well as in cancer outreach, cancer education and training, and in biobanking. During the U54 Partnership renewal period there will be a focus on precision cancer medicine to address disparities regarding the representation of Hispanic/Latino populations in biorepositories and databases, and the “omics” analyses of tumor and normal tissues from this underrepresented group.",(1/2) Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership,9569588,U54CA163071,"['Accreditation ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Florida ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Hematology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Island ', ' Joints ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rotation ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Talents ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Peer Review Grants ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer care ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Stem cell transplant ', ' Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Progenitor Cell Transplantation ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Grant Review ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Surgical Oncology ', ' oncologic surgery ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Outreach Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' sun protection ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' tumor ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' screening ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' precision cancer care ', ' personalized oncology ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' precision oncology ', ' education research ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,PONCE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2018,1707303,-0.048099802109092905
"2/2 SDSU/UCSD Cancer Center Comprehensive Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) OVERALL ABSTRACT: This application seeks funding to continue to support the SDSU/UCSD Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership. Our vision, consistent with that of the Comprehensive Partnership for the Advancement of Health Equity (CPACHE) program, is to continue to develop outstanding programs in research, research education, and community outreach in order to understand and address causes for cancer health disparities in our catchment areas of San Diego and Imperial counties, a region with a large and growing Hispanic/Latino population. As this population ages, the number of cancer cases is expected to grow.

"2/2, University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry is a highly underserved minority with a significant, disparate burden of cancer. In addition, they are also highly underrepresented among cancer researchers and cancer health care professionals. The University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) have been engaged in a unique and successful partnership over the past twelve years, currently supported by a U54 grant. As the only U54 Partnership addressing cancer health disparities in Pacific Islanders, the UOG/UHCC Partnership is characterized by a significant number of very distinctive aspects and opportunities. In particular, 37% of the Guam population is represented by indigenous Chamorros/part-Chamorros, while 38% are Filipino and Micronesian. The unique ethnic characteristics of this UOG/UHCC Partnership are paralleled by its unique geographic characteristics (the region covered by HI, GU, and U.S. Pacific Territories/jurisdictions), as well as unique regional opportunities for research, education, and outreach. The UOG/UHCC Partnership has indeed been transformational for the UOG and the Territory of Guam as specified in UOG's Letter of Commitment, including the establishment of a Cancer Research Center at UOG and implementation of legislation markedly increasing taxes on tobacco products. At UHCC the U54 has resulted in increased cancer health disparities research in Pacific Islanders. In this U54 renewal application, our overarching goal is to establish our Partner- ship as the national and international leader in advancing cancer health equity in Pacific Islanders. To achieve this goal we will build upon the success of the last five and a half years. All Specific Aims of the individual components of our application support our overall objectives, namely 1) to continue to develop the cancer re- search capability and competitiveness of faculty at UOG by increasing the number of UOG faculty with investigator-initiated funding and peer-reviewed publications; 2) to further develop the focus of UHCC research on cancer health disparities, with particular emphasis on Pacific Islanders and related topics of regional relevance such as betel nut chewing and cervical cancer screening and prevention; 3) To continue raising the awareness of cancer and cancer prevention in the multiethnic communities served by UOG and UHCC, with emphasis on Pacific Islanders; and 4) to increase the number of cancer and biomedical science researchers of Pacific Is- lander ancestry in the U.S. by continuing our successful MA, MS, and PhD training programs for Pacific Is- lander students in cancer-related fields, as well as providing guidance to early stage faculty investigators. The leadership at UOG and UHCC are highly committed to this Partnership as evidenced by their strong Letters of Support and the commitment of significant resources to the Partnership. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This grant has supported the only cancer research infrastructure established west of Hawaii, in the U.S. Territory of Guam. Continued funding will support three research projects described herein, focusing on cancers of regional significance. The partnership provides opportunities for faculty as well as pre-doctoral and post-doctoral students to develop and strengthen skills in project design and administration, team collaboration, recruitment and retention, specimen collection, data analysis, manuscript writing, grantsmanship among others. Early stage and senior investigators at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center will gain opportunities to work with new populations in the Hawaii-Pacific region, including Chamorros, Chuukese and Marshallese, and establish collaborations with UOG faculty who share interests in cancer health disparities research.","2/2, University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership",9553529,U54CA143728,"['Accreditation ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Career Choice ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Hawaii ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Mastication ', ' chews ', ' chewed ', ' Chewing ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Nuts ', ' Pacific Islands ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Taxes ', ' Tobacco ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' skills ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Indigenous ', ' International ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' CRCH ', ' Cancer Research Center of Hawaii ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Characteristics ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' doctoral student ', ' education research ', ' underserved minority ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF GUAM,U54,2018,977538,-0.004190922390270139

"2/2 NCCU-DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership ABSTRACT The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) – DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership (NCCU-DCI-CDTRP) is focused on developing infrastructure for translational cancer health disparities research, education and training and on performing two such pilot research projects, focusing on the molecular aspects underlying the increased lethality of prostate and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans, with direct application to prevention, detection and treatment. This Program is built on the long-standing relationship between the two Durham-based Institutions, less than four miles apart. NCCU is an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students (ISUPS), affiliated with the 17- member University of North Carolina system and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center (CC). The Partnership, focusing on translational cancer health disparities research and education and training of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage investigators (ESIs) in this field, which is described by the NIH Translational Research Working Group, will distinguish itself with synergistic complementarity to an existing U54 between NCCU and UNC, which focuses on sociocultural disparities research and education and training of undergraduate students. To this Partnership, the Biomanufacturing Research Institute and Technology Enterprise (BRITE) faculty at NCCU will bring a unique perspective from an ISUPS, expertise in pharmaceuticals, drug discovery and development, as well as existing extensive health disparities education and training programs. The CC, DCI, will bring a unique distinguishing focus on biospecimen collection, correlative science in the context of clinical trials, development of racially diverse cancer patient-derived models and programs addressing minority accrual to treatment and biospecimen collection clinical trials. Development of the Partnership occurred and is continuing around planning and priority- setting stages, including selection of co-developed, collaborative pilot research projects and creation of a fully integrated, bi-directional, mutually beneficial Cancer Research Education Program (CREP). The Implementation stage will launch the pilot research projects, utilizing nearly 25 Shared Resources between NCCU and Duke, the CREP and the engagement of underserved minority populations across the region and state, with complementary existing programming mutually emanating from NCCU, which directly serves a minority community, and DCI's Office of Health Equity and Disparities. The Partnership will be led by an integrated Administrative Core of senior investigators who will serve as mentors to ESIs, rigorously addressing career development, to postdoctoral fellows and to graduate students and will include an extensive Evaluation Program for tracking impact and outcomes. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), an External Advisory Committee (EAC), focused solely on scientific guidance, and a Community Advisory Board (CAB). This NCI P20 collaborative partnership, “North Carolina Central University–Duke Cancer Institute Cancer Disparities Translational Research Program” (NCCU-DCI CDTRP), is relevant to cancer health disparities research, education and training. Regarding research, this application’s Pilot Projects focus on understanding and modulating molecular pathways in human tumors that contribute to the increased lethality of prostate cancer and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans. Elucidating these pathways will contribute to better prevention, detection and treatment of these cancers. The Administrative Core and aforementioned Pilot Projects will be done by DCI, a NCI- designated Cancer Center, and NCCU, an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students, in collaboration.

"1/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE        Project Narrative: The presence of major cancer health inequities in Chicago is well-documented. This proposed 3 institutional partnership poses a strong and important approach for reducing deeply-engrained disparities. CCPACHE is a partnership in research, education, and community outreach aimed directly at building and fostering the next generation pipeline of students and faculty entering health-related careers, increasing the number of cancer health disparities researchers, and facilitating the translation of cancer research that is directly informed by, and relevant to, Chicagoland communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",1/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity,9534013,U54CA203000,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Mission ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' forging ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' under-represented student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' minority graduate ', ' Minority Graduate Student ', ' community center ', ' student training ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U54,2018,1240068,-0.016855895909280497

"South Carolina Cancer Health Equity Consortium (SC CHEC): Summer Undergraduate Research Training Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), the University of South Carolina (USC), and three historically black colleges/universities - Claflin University (CU), South Carolina State University (SCSU), and Voorhees College (VC) - have joined forces under the larger aegis of the South Carolina Cancer Health Equity Consortium (SC CHEC) to develop this application for an R25E NIH/NCI Cancer Education Grants Program. Together, these institutions have created an innovative, inter-institutional, 14-week summer course. This is combined with a hands-on laboratory research training platform and career mentoring by some of the nation's leading cancer researchers to attract and catalyze a new generation of diverse biomedical scientists. Within this new five-year initiative, 80 undergraduate juniors and seniors (designated as SC CHEC Student Fellows) from USC, CU, SCSU, and VC will engage with investigators at the MUSC Hollings Cancer Center, a National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated cancer center, to expose them to the latest advances in biomedical research spanning basic, clinical, and population sciences with an emphasis on cancer disparity dynamics in South Carolina (SC). The curriculum and training of this new initiative are focused on four of the most disparate cancers in terms of incidence, morbidity, and mortality in SC - breast, prostate, head/neck, and cervical cancer. Health outcomes for patients diagnosed with these four cancers are strongly influenced by race, ethnicity, urban/rural residence, socioeconomic position, and potentially biology. This R25E program's primary strategy will employ in-person classroom and laboratory instruction within the context of contemporary scientific approaches to cancer research at MUSC. These will be complemented by selected clinical and biotechnology-focused rotations, community engagement, and Graduate Record Examination preparation. The SC CHEC leadership strongly believes that promoting interest, career development, and commitment from the Millennial Generation (those born in the 1990s) to cancer biomedical and biobehavioral research is a critical step to attaining health equity and improved health outcomes in SC and beyond.

"1/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Individuals from underserved minority communities in the U.S. experience poor outcomes for the majority of cancers as a result of inequities in access to high quality healthcare, socio-cultural and environmental determinants, and in some cases behavioral and biologic factors. Inequities in cancer outcomes are rooted in a wide range of structural, socio-cultural, and policy-related determinants that are operative throughout the U.S., but local factors can perpetuate and influence the magnitude of disparate cancer outcomes. To some extent, high cancer mortality among racial and ethnic minority segments of the population is a national manifestation of a wide range of local problems. A promising strategy to address cancer disparities is to foster research to understand local patterns of cancer mortality and root causes of disparities, and to test interventions informed by those findings that account for the needs of the local community. This paradigm for addressing cancer disparities has been successfully employed by a large cadre of cancer researchers at the University of Illinois Cancer Center (UICC) for more than a decade and forms the basis of the UICC vision to be a “bench- to-community” NCI-designated cancer center. Governors State University (GSU) has invested substantially in basic science and health science infrastructure, increased efforts to recruit faculty members with an interest in research, and significantly enhanced research support services over the past several years. As a result, GSU is positioned to address growing cancer disparities in their community. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop additional infrastructure that will build on the strengths of the partnering institutions in order to enhance their capacity to conduct cancer health inequities research that is driven by local data and informed by the cancer-related needs of local communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE (OVERALL): The GUIDE (GSU-UICC-Disparities-Education) Cancer Research Training Project is a collaborative initiative between GSU and UICC. The institutions will jointly conduct a pilot research project addressing a local, cancer-related health disparity and will develop a training program for GSU junior faculty and undergraduate students designed to attract and prepare investigators for careers in cancer disparities.",1/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project,9554853,P20CA202908,"['Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentors ', ' mortality ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' science education ', ' member ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' research study ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Localized Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Localized Malignancy ', ' Localized Cancer ', ' Local Cancer ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' R21 Award ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' recruit teachers ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' summer research ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority investigator ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' racial minority ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,P20,2018,186883,-0.012545005370573833

"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center (SC CADRE) SUMMARY This five-year U54 proposal is a collaborative, inter-institutional partnership between South Carolina State University (SCSU), an Historically Black University (HBCU), and the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC-HCC), a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. The partnership began in 2011 under the auspices of an NCI P20 CPACHE grant and has grown to produce this U54 South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center (SC CADRE) application. With input from their joint community partner, the Regional Medical Center of Orangeburg Mabry Cancer Center (RMC-MCC), investigators at both institutions collaborated to design the SC CADRE. The overarching goals of the SC CADRE are to increase SCSU's capacity to conduct transdisciplinary cancer research and to further strengthen and extend a longitudinal research education pipeline that will catalyze a new diverse generation of biomedical researchers focused on cancer disparities. The SC CADRE has three major themes. The first focuses on evaluating the relationship between obesity and prostate and breast cancer disparities. The second theme emphasizes evaluation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) as a novel biomarker related to cancer, cancer disparities, and obesity. The third theme highlights the inclusion of a population unique to the US southeastern coastal region, the Sea Island (SI)/Gullah population. Within five years, the SC CADRE aims for: 1) further elucidation of molecular mechanisms contributing to cancer disparities; 2) an enhanced pipeline of diverse cancer researchers; 3) an increased number of NIH research proposals led by SCSU faculty as independent investigators; and 4) greater community engagement in cancer research. Due to the longstanding SCSU /MUSC-HCC academic partnership and each entity's research and educational strengths and community relationships, the SC CADRE is poised to transform cancer health outcomes for South Carolinians. OVERALL PROJECT NARRATIVE The South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center is an inter-institutional partnership between South Carolina State University (SCSU) and the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center.

"2/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) initiated their Partnership in August 2002. The early years of the Partnership during the U56 funding period (2005-2010) established the foundational support and scientific leadership needed to build a solid and vibrant research collaboration. Moving forward, the U54 mechanism drew on this foundation resulting in a robust set of activities in research, capacity building and outreach. Two key tenets guide this sustained partnership between UMass Boston and DF/HCC: a) A common and intense interest in addressing the problem of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality; and b) A belief that through the Partnership, each institution will achieve benefits that neither could achieve on its own. This application for renewal provides extensive evidence of the ways these tenets have been operationalized, the resulting benefits for both institutions and the ways in which this Partnership is now poised to make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control. We are proposing activities that draw on the latest science to understand and address cancer disparities through a transdisciplinary approach that embodies our Partnership theme of “Cells to Society. In support of our new cohesive theme, we have proposed three sophisticated, highly competitive research projects across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. To elucidate new areas of research opportunity, the Partnership is excited to explore the intersection between biology-based sciences and social/behavioral sciences. The immediate priorities Summary: ” of the Partnership are: 1) Continuing capacity building for biomedical and cancer research at UMass Boston and cancer disparities research at DF/HCC; 2) Enhancing and scaling up research experiences for students with a specific focus on underrepresented minorities (URMs), across the entire educational pipeline –from undergraduate to postdoctoral levels (see Research Education Core); 3) Continuing close mentoring of early stage investigators with a focus on research and career development; 4) Building a strong and robust Outreach Core that draws on the state of the science from dissemination and implementation sciences (D&I) for building partnerships, translating knowledge and monitoring the results of the translation efforts to build and sustain capacity among community-based organizations (see Outreach Core); 5) Offering infrastructural support to U54 investigators through two service cores, including the Research Design and Analysis, and Genomics Cores (see Shared Resource Core); and 6) Ensuring sustainability for projects, Cores and research education programs via dedicated planning and execution of grant matching with NIH-mechanisms, foundation support and/or institutional support. Project Narrative: The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Partnership is committed to further developing a shared rigorous and collaborative transdisciplinary cancer and disparities-related research program that spans the continuum of “Cells to Society.” Sophisticated research projects are proposed across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. These projects, together with state-of-the-art Outreach and Research Education Cores and creative Research Design and Analysis and Genomics Shared Resources, will serve to build research capacity and infrastructure at UMass Boston, expand the cancer disparities platform and community outreach programs at DF/HCC; and make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control.","2/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research",9547820,U54CA156732,"['Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Boston ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Ramp ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' novel ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' Genomics ', ' statistical service ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Genomics Shared Resource ', ' Outreach Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' scale up ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' implementation science ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' personalized cancer treatment ', ' individualized cancer therapy ', ' personalized cancer therapy ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' education research ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,U54,2018,2163618,-0.03162028340132182
"2/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE        Project Narrative: The presence of major cancer health inequities in Chicago is well-documented. This proposed 3 institutional partnership poses a strong and important approach for reducing deeply-engrained disparities. CCPACHE is a partnership in research, education, and community outreach aimed directly at building and fostering the next generation pipeline of students and faculty entering health-related careers, increasing the number of cancer health disparities researchers, and facilitating the translation of cancer research that is directly informed by, and relevant to, Chicagoland communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",2/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity,9533867,U54CA202995,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Mission ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' forging ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' under-represented student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' minority graduate ', ' Minority Graduate Student ', ' community center ', ' student training ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,U54,2018,789845,-0.016855895909280497
"2/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Individuals from underserved minority communities in the U.S. experience poor outcomes for the majority of cancers as a result of inequities in access to high quality healthcare, socio-cultural and environmental determinants, and in some cases behavioral and biologic factors. Inequities in cancer outcomes are rooted in a wide range of structural, socio-cultural, and policy-related determinants that are operative throughout the U.S., but local factors can perpetuate and influence the magnitude of disparate cancer outcomes. To some extent, high cancer mortality among racial and ethnic minority segments of the population is a national manifestation of a wide range of local problems. A promising strategy to address cancer disparities is to foster research to understand local patterns of cancer mortality and root causes of disparities, and to test interventions informed by those findings that account for the needs of the local community. This paradigm for addressing cancer disparities has been successfully employed by a large cadre of cancer researchers at the University of Illinois Cancer Center (UICC) for more than a decade and forms the basis of the UICC vision to be a “bench- to-community” NCI-designated cancer center. Governors State University (GSU) has invested substantially in basic science and health science infrastructure, increased efforts to recruit faculty members with an interest in research, and significantly enhanced research support services over the past several years. As a result, GSU is positioned to address growing cancer disparities in their community. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop additional infrastructure that will build on the strengths of the partnering institutions in order to enhance their capacity to conduct cancer health inequities research that is driven by local data and informed by the cancer-related needs of local communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE (OVERALL): The GUIDE (GSU-UICC-Disparities-Education) Cancer Research Training Project is a collaborative initiative between GSU and UICC. The institutions will jointly conduct a pilot research project addressing a local, cancer-related health disparity and will develop a training program for GSU junior faculty and undergraduate students designed to attract and prepare investigators for careers in cancer disparities.",2/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project,9766627,P20CA202907,"['Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentors ', ' mortality ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' science education ', ' member ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' research study ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Localized Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Localized Malignancy ', ' Localized Cancer ', ' Local Cancer ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' R21 Award ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' recruit teachers ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' summer research ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority investigator ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' racial minority ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NCI,GOVERNORS STATE UNIVERSITY,P20,2018,48872,-0.012545005370573833

"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center (SC CaDRe) SUMMARY This five-year U54 proposal is a collaborative, inter-institutional partnership between South Carolina State University (SCSU), an Historically Black University (HBCU), and the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC-HCC), a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. The partnership began in 2011 under the auspices of an NCI P20 CPACHE grant and has grown to produce this U54 South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center (SC CADRE) application. With input from their joint community partner, the Regional Medical Center of Orangeburg Mabry Cancer Center (RMC-MCC), investigators at both institutions collaborated to design the SC CADRE. The overarching goals of the SC CADRE are to increase SCSU's capacity to conduct transdisciplinary cancer research and to further strengthen and extend a longitudinal research education pipeline that will catalyze a new diverse generation of biomedical researchers focused on cancer disparities. The SC CADRE has three major themes. The first focuses on evaluating the relationship between obesity and prostate and breast cancer disparities. The second theme emphasizes evaluation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) as a novel biomarker related to cancer, cancer disparities, and obesity. The third theme highlights the inclusion of a population unique to the US southeastern coastal region, the Sea Island (SI)/Gullah population. Within five years, the SC CADRE aims for: 1) further elucidation of molecular mechanisms contributing to cancer disparities; 2) an enhanced pipeline of diverse cancer researchers; 3) an increased number of NIH research proposals led by SCSU faculty as independent investigators; and 4) greater community engagement in cancer research. Due to the longstanding SCSU /MUSC-HCC academic partnership and each entity's research and educational strengths and community relationships, the SC CADRE is poised to transform cancer health outcomes for South Carolinians. OVERALL PROJECT NARRATIVE The South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center is an inter-institutional partnership between South Carolina State University (SCSU) and the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center.

"CBPR: Enhancing Capacity to Use Innovative Methodologies - Administrative Supplement Abstract The past two decades have seen continued recognition that more innovative and community-engaged approaches to research and interventions are needed to address the social and environmental determinants of population health and more specifically racial and ethnic inequities in health. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is one such approach to community-engaged research. Increased funding support for CBPR is in keeping with the mission statement of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the research capacity- building priorities delineated in the NIH Health Disparities Strategic Plan 2009-2013, and select research goals of the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR). As the need for and opportunities to expand CBPR increase, so does the need to enhance capacity in innovative methods for researchers conducting behavioral and social sciences research (BSSR) to use this approach. Not only is CBPR an innovative approach in and of itself, there are also several specific innovations within the context of a CBPR approach that are particularly relevant to the mission of NIH. These include the integrated use of mixed methods, and innovative research designs that complement randomized controlled designs. There are few opportunities for both early-career and established researchers to engage in a co-learning process facilitated by experienced academic-community faculty teams. Further, there is a need to promote the diversity of the BSSR workforce, including increasing participation of researchers from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Thus, over the past four years we have conducted the research education program, Community-Based Participatory Research: Enhancing Capacity to Use Innovative Methodologies in the Behavioral and Social Sciences (the Enhance Program), with the overarching goal to enhance knowledge and skills in the use of innovative methodologies in CBPR, in partnership with the communities involved, to examine and address health inequities. The Enhance Program has been carried out by the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center, a CBPR partnership established in 1995 aimed at enhancing understanding of and addressing factors that contribute to health inequities in the city of Detroit. The two-pronged approach of the Enhance Program has been: 1) to develop, implement, and evaluate an intensive short course in innovative methodologies in CBPR for conducting behavioral and social sciences research; and 2) to enhance and integrate learning from the short course through a series of follow-on educational activities, an applied CBPR project, mentoring, and development of a network of diverse scholars for career development and innovation in BSSR using a CBPR approach to promote health equity. Based on the evaluation results the program has been successful on a number of dimensions. Given that the fifth year of the original proposed program was not funded, the Administrative Supplement will meet the identified need to enhance and extend the evaluation and sustainability of the program, and to disseminate broadly the materials and lessons learned. Project Narrative To solve complex public health problems, community-based participatory research (CBPR), a collaborative, participatory approach between academic and community partners is particularly effective. CBPR is an innovative approach for researchers conducting behavioral and social sciences research and numerous innovative methods are relevant within this approach. This Administrative Supplement aims to strengthen the capacity of academic and community partners to implement CBPR principles and innovative methodologies in their work, and disseminate findings and lessons learned from such partnerships.",CBPR: Enhancing Capacity to Use Innovative Methodologies - Administrative Supplement,9705362,R25GM111837,"['Academy ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Program Sustainabilities ', ' Program Sustainability ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' network models ', ' social science research ', ' health equity ', ' population health ', ' faculty community ', ' education research ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R25,2018,214861,0.04083530261653654
"1/2 U-HAND (University of Houston/MD Anderson) Program to Reduce Cancer Disparities ABSTRACT The U-HAND (University of Houston /MD Anderson) Program to Reduce Cancer Disparities seeks to build and maintain a long-term, collaborative partnership between the University of Houston (ISUPS, Hispanic-Serving Institution) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (NCI-designated cancer center) that supports and stimulates excellence in educational programming and innovation in research designed to affect health equity among racial/ethnic groups disproportionately affected by cancer disparities. This will be achieved by better understanding and addressing the social determinants of cancer risk factors through community-engaged educational and scientific practices that synergistically capitalize on the strengths and contributions of the constituent partners. Our educational, outreach, and research initiatives will focus on the reduction of cancer risk among blacks and Hispanics in two key Houston communities: the Third Ward (largely black) and the East End (largely Hispanic). The U-HAND will have three cores: Administrative, Pilot Research Program, and Cancer Research Education Program, which will achieve the following specific aims: 1) Develop a research and educational partnership between the University of Houston, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Houston community to stimulate collaborative cancer disparities research related to tobacco use, poor diet, and physical inactivity among blacks and Hispanics; 2) Support the development of Early Stage Investigators through a rigorous pilot research program; 3) Increase the number of underrepresented racial/ethnic minority students and faculty engaged in cancer disparities research by providing them with research training, mentorship and service learning experiences; and 4) Develop a robust community outreach program focused on engaging community members in cancer disparities education, research, and clinical trials.

"(1/2) Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership The Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU) and the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) have forged a strong working relationship founded on seamless communication with mutual support and benefits. With Partnership resources and significant commitment from both institutions, we have established joint programs enhancing basic and clinical research, enriching cancer outreach, expanding cancer education, and creating a unique Hispanic/Latino (H/L) Biobank, leading to the development of a robust network and infrastructure necessary for a sustained long-term collaboration to improve cancer outcomes in the H/L population. The U54 Partnership's immediate impact includes the identification of new mutations in breast and lung cancer in H/L patients, recruitment of new faculty essential for sustainability and growth, and 84 community outreach educational activities for H/Ls in Florida (FL) and Puerto Rico (PR). The development of the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB) and the training of clinical researchers, with 25 clinical intervention trials activated in Ponce, demonstrate the broad impact realized through the Partnership. Furthermore the Partnership had a critical role in the ACGME re-accreditation of the Hematology/Oncology Fellowship in PR, in the establishment of two stem cell transplant programs in PR by fellows trained in the MCC Bone Marrow Transplant unit, and in the establishment of an ACGME-accredited surgical residency in Ponce with surgical oncology rotations at MCC. The short-term metrics of the first 4 years of the U54 Partnership grant include 48 student participants, 35 peer-reviewed manuscripts published, and 29 grants funded out of a total of 64 submitted.  Our vision for the U54 PACHE renewal is to further grow and engage faculty and students in cancer precision medicine research that directly impacts the H/L populations in FL and PR. The Partnership has the requisite components to fully execute precision medicine in an underserved population—a biobank, quantitative science core (QSC) to analyze data, culturally sensitive outreach materials, expertise in the latest technologies, and a robust research portfolio. The four specific aims for the U54 Partnership renewal are the following. Aim 1: To increase the number of researchers at PHSU focused on basic/translational research in cancer and to augment the number of researchers in cancer health disparities at MCC. This is facilitated with joint projects in ovarian and breast cancer. Aim 2: To further develop outreach programs and research efforts in the H/L communities at both PHSU and MCC. An epidemiological project will examine the impact of receipt of MC1R genotypes on personal sun protection behaviors. Aim 3: To increase support for basic, translational and clinical research in the H/L population by establishing the QSC and further developing the PRBB. The MCC Total Cancer Care protocol will be developed in Ponce hospitals and leveraged by the PRBB to facilitate tissue collection. Aim 4: To provide comprehensive and structured student research education at both PHSU and MCC to facilitate the expansion and success of cancer researchers and clinicians in the H/L population. Over the last 10 years, the Ponce Health Sciences University in Puerto Rico and the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida have developed an exceptionally strong working relationship facilitated by the U56 Partnership Planning and U54 PACHE Comprehensive Partnership awards. The joint programs have resulted in successful outcomes in basic, translational, population and clinical research, as well as in cancer outreach, cancer education and training, and in biobanking. During the U54 Partnership renewal period there will be a focus on precision cancer medicine to address disparities regarding the representation of Hispanic/Latino populations in biorepositories and databases, and the “omics” analyses of tumor and normal tissues from this underrepresented group.",(1/2) Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership,9674587,U54CA163071,"['Accreditation ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Florida ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Hematology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Island ', ' Joints ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rotation ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Talents ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Peer Review Grants ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer care ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Stem cell transplant ', ' Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Progenitor Cell Transplantation ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Grant Review ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Surgical Oncology ', ' oncologic surgery ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Outreach Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' sun protection ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' tumor ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' screening ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' precision cancer care ', ' personalized oncology ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' precision oncology ', ' education research ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,PONCE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2018,48687,-0.048099802109092905
"Understanding and Addressing Cancer Health Disparities in Louisiana ABSTRACT: Cancer health disparities represent a major public health crisis in the state of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. The citizens of this region have to contend with cancer incidence and mortality rates that are among the highest in the nation. In addition, we have a very high incidence of specific malignancies that disproportionately affect minorities and the underserved citizens of the region. Triple negative breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, endometrial cancer, advanced prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, among others, are more common and appear to be more aggressive among minorities. Complex socio-economic and political reasons and an increase in co-morbidities, such as obesity, may in part help explain the origin of some of these health disparities. However, increasing evidence from genomics and cancer biology, including our work, has started to shed light on the biological basis for some of these inequities, and suggests specific interventions to help ameliorate the impact of these diseases and improve patient outcomes. We plan to use this P20 planning grant to establish research projects that bring together the best investigators and institutions in Louisiana who are conducting research on the genetics/genomics, immunology, and clinical and public health aspects of cancer with special emphasis on health disparities. Under the leadership of the LSU Stanley S. Scott Cancer Center in New Orleans (LSU-CC-NO) and in partnership with investigators from academic and medical institutions in the state, we have agreed to conduct research under the new Gulf South Center for Research and Solutions in Cancer Health Disparities (Gulf South-CARES-CHD). To ensure a focused and productive effort, this P20 grant we will study the genomic signature and inflammation characteristics of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a disease that disproportionately affects young African-American women in Louisiana. We believe that understanding the genomics and inflammatory biology of specific cancers may provide insights into mechanisms of resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and help identify and test potential interventions for improving the therapeutic efficacy of current and future treatments. Besides creating competitive teams of researchers, we will build the necessary intellectual and organizational infrastructure and develop the preliminary data to plan and support research projects that qualify for a SPORE application. Our combined expertise, the unique patient populations available in Louisiana, and the commitment of our institutions will enable us to achieve these goals, which will improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in underserved populations, both in Louisiana and globally. Cancers that cause major health disparities such as triple negative breast cancer, liver, endometrial, and advanced prostate cancer affect the African-American minority population, in particular women, in Louisiana. Although socioeconomic differences and access to health care have helped explain some of these inequalities, genomic and biological data may help explain the poor response to chemotherapy regimens and poor outcomes in these malignancies. We have created the Gulf South Center for Research and Solutions in Cancer Health Disparities (Gulf South-CARES-CHD), bringing together regional investigators conducting research in cancer health disparities to generate data for understanding the biological and social determinants of health disparities and developing new interventions and clinical trials that address these inequalities.",Understanding and Addressing Cancer Health Disparities in Louisiana,9630120,P20CA233374,"['Affect ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor

"University of California Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (UCaMP) to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities OVERALL University of California Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (UCaMP) to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of UCaMP is to establish and characterize at least 200 patient-derived cancer xenografts (PDXs), and utilize these PDXs in preclinical testing of single agents and drug combinations that help guide future clinical decision-making emphasizing the largest racial/ethnic minority populations residing in California: Hispanic/Latino Americans [HLAs], Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander [AANHPIs], and African American [AAs] compared to Non-Hispanic Whites [NHWs]. We have established an accomplished transdisciplinary research team with an outstanding infrastructure that includes a University of California-wide central IRB system called Reliance and strong preliminary data to support the proposed PDX and cancer disparities research, thus allowing our results to be easily translated to clinical trials. UCaMP is comprised of four University of California NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers: UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UC Davis), UC Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCLA), UC Irvine Health Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UC Irvine), and UC San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCSF). Our collective strengths include complementary expertise in PDX development and drug testing, cancer health disparities, and clinical trial development robustly supported by cores for PDX, Pilot Studies, Bioinformatics, and Administration. We will achieve our goal through two Research Projects. Project 1 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX Models for Gastric and Liver Tumors, specifically addresses cancer health disparities in gastric cancers (GC) and liver cancers (LC) that disproportionately affect all racial/ethnic minorities especially in HLA and AANHPI populations. By understanding the genetic and response differences among HLA, AANHPI compared to NHWs, we could enhance the precision of therapeutic treatments, identify resistance-associated biomarkers, and study resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies. Project 2 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX Models for Lung and Bladder Tumors focuses on treatment disparities between AA and NHW patients to identify therapies targeting common genetic alterations (e.g. PI3K pathway) and to reveal targeted therapy resistance mechanisms for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and advanced bladder cancer (aBC). NARRATIVE The cumulative impact of UCaMP is the leverage of four University of California Comprehensive Centers in characterizing various drug treatment responses to minority patient-derived gastric, liver, bladder, and lung cancer models. Together this research will contribute to elucidating biological determinants of cancer health disparities.",University of California Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial

"3/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE        Project Narrative: The presence of major cancer health inequities in Chicago is well-documented. This proposed 3 institutional partnership poses a strong and important approach for reducing deeply-engrained disparities. CCPACHE is a partnership in research, education, and community outreach aimed directly at building and fostering the next generation pipeline of students and faculty entering health-related careers, increasing the number of cancer health disparities researchers, and facilitating the translation of cancer research that is directly informed by, and relevant to, Chicagoland communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",3/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity,9539978,U54CA202997,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Mission ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' forging ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' under-represented student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' minority graduate ', ' Minority Graduate Student ', ' community center ', ' student training ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U54,2018,1759257,-0.016855895909280497
"1/2 SDSU/UCSD Cancer Center Comprehensive Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) OVERALL ABSTRACT: This application seeks funding to continue to support the SDSU/UCSD Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership. Our vision, consistent with that of the Comprehensive Partnership for the Advancement of Health Equity (CPACHE) program, is to continue to develop outstanding programs in research, research education, and community outreach in order to understand and address causes for cancer health disparities in our catchment areas of San Diego and Imperial counties, a region with a large and growing Hispanic/Latino population. As this population ages, the number of cancer cases is expected to grow. Addressing the existing gaps in research, education, and health care delivery in this ethnic group is a high priority of our Partnership, which leverages th distinct yet complementary strengths and resources of San Diego State University (SDSU), an officially designated Hispanic Serving Institution, and the University of California (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center (MCC), an NCI-designated Cancer Center.

"2/2 Ponce School of Medicine-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU) and the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) have forged a strong working relationship founded on seamless communication with mutual support and benefits. With Partnership resources and significant commitment from both institutions, we have established joint programs enhancing basic and clinical research, enriching cancer outreach, expanding cancer education, and creating a unique Hispanic/Latino (H/L) Biobank, leading to the development of a robust network and infrastructure necessary for a sustained long-term collaboration to improve cancer outcomes in the H/L population. The U54 Partnership’s immediate impact includes the identification of new mutations in breast and lung cancer in H/L patients, recruitment of new faculty essential for sustainability and growth, and 84 community outreach educational activities for H/Ls in Florida (FL) and Puerto Rico (PR). The development of the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB) and the training of clinical researchers, with 25 clinical intervention trials activated in Ponce, demonstrate the broad impact realized through the Partnership. Furthermore the Partnership had a critical role in the ACGME re-accreditation of the Hematology/Oncology Fellowship in PR, in the establishment of two stem cell transplant programs in PR by fellows trained in the MCC Bone Marrow Transplant unit, and in the establishment of an ACGME-accredited surgical residency in Ponce with surgical oncology rotations at MCC. The short-term metrics of the first 4 years of the U54 Partnership grant include 48 student participants, 35 peer-reviewed manuscripts published, and 29 grants funded out of a total of 64 submitted.  Our vision for the U54 PACHE renewal is to further grow and engage faculty and students in cancer precision medicine research that directly impacts the H/L populations in FL and PR. The Partnership has the requisite components to fully execute precision medicine in an underserved population—a biobank, quantitative science core (QSC) to analyze data, culturally sensitive outreach materials, expertise in the latest technologies, and a robust research portfolio. The four specific aims for the U54 Partnership renewal are the following. Aim 1: To increase the number of researchers at PHSU focused on basic/translational research in cancer and to augment the number of researchers in cancer health disparities at MCC. This is facilitated with joint projects in ovarian and breast cancer. Aim 2: To further develop outreach programs and research efforts in the H/L communities at both PHSU and MCC. An epidemiological project will examine the impact of receipt of MC1R genotypes on personal sun protection behaviors. Aim 3: To increase support for basic, translational and clinical research in the H/L population by establishing the QSC and further developing the PRBB. The MCC Total Cancer Care protocol will be developed in Ponce hospitals and leveraged by the PRBB to facilitate tissue collection. Aim 4: To provide comprehensive and structured student research education at both PHSU and MCC to facilitate the expansion and success of cancer researchers and clinicians in the H/L population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the last 10 years, the Ponce Health Sciences University in Puerto Rico and the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida have developed an exceptionally strong working relationship facilitated by the U56 Partnership Planning and U54 PACHE Comprehensive Partnership awards. The joint programs have resulted in successful outcomes in basic, translational, population and clinical research, as well as in cancer outreach, cancer education and training, and in biobanking. During the U54 Partnership renewal period there will be a focus on precision cancer medicine to address disparities regarding the representation of Hispanic/Latino populations in biorepositories and databases, and the “omics” analyses of tumor and normal tissues from this underrepresented group.",2/2 Ponce School of Medicine-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership,9571211,U54CA163068,"['Accreditation ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Florida ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Hematology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Island ', ' Joints ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rotation ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Talents ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Peer Review Grants ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer care ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Stem cell transplant ', ' Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Progenitor Cell Transplantation ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Grant Review ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Surgical Oncology ', ' oncologic surgery ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Outreach Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' sun protection ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' tumor ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' screening ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' precision cancer care ', ' personalized oncology ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' precision oncology ', ' education research ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"(1/2) University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Project Summary/Abstract: Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry is a highly underserved minority with a significant, disparate burden of cancer. In addition, they are also highly underrepresented among cancer researchers and cancer health care professionals. The University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) have been engaged in a unique and successful partnership over the past twelve years, currently supported by a U54 grant. As the only U54 Partnership addressing cancer health disparities in Pacific Islanders, the UOG/UHCC Partnership is characterized by a significant number of very distinctive aspects and opportunities. In particular, 37% of the Guam population is represented by indigenous Chamorros/part-Chamorros, while 38% are Filipino and Micronesian. The unique ethnic characteristics of this UOG/UHCC Partnership are paralleled by its unique geographic characteristics (the region covered by HI, GU, and U.S. Pacific Territories/jurisdictions), as well as unique regional opportunities for research, education, and outreach. The UOG/UHCC Partnership has indeed been transformational for the UOG and the Territory of Guam as specified in UOG's Letter of Commitment, including the establishment of a Cancer Research Center at UOG and implementation of legislation markedly increasing taxes on tobacco products. At UHCC the U54 has resulted in increased cancer health disparities research in Pacific Islanders. In this U54 renewal application, our overarching goal is to establish our Partner- ship as the national and international leader in advancing cancer health equity in Pacific Islanders. To achieve this goal we will build upon the success of the last five and a half years. All Specific Aims of the individual components of our application support our overall objectives, namely 1) to continue to develop the cancer re- search capability and competitiveness of faculty at UOG by increasing the number of UOG faculty with investigator-initiated funding and peer-reviewed publications; 2) to further develop the focus of UHCC research on cancer health disparities, with particular emphasis on Pacific Islanders and related topics of regional relevance such as betel nut chewing and cervical cancer screening and prevention; 3) To continue raising the awareness of cancer and cancer prevention in the multiethnic communities served by UOG and UHCC, with emphasis on Pacific Islanders; and 4) to increase the number of cancer and biomedical science researchers of Pacific Is- lander ancestry in the U.S. by continuing our successful MA, MS, and PhD training programs for Pacific Is- lander students in cancer-related fields, as well as providing guidance to early stage faculty investigators. The leadership at UOG and UHCC are highly committed to this Partnership as evidenced by their strong Letters of Support and the commitment of significant resources to the Partnership.

"2/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Individuals from underserved minority communities in the U.S. experience poor outcomes for the majority of cancers as a result of inequities in access to high quality healthcare, socio-cultural and environmental determinants, and in some cases behavioral and biologic factors. Inequities in cancer outcomes are rooted in a wide range of structural, socio-cultural, and policy-related determinants that are operative throughout the U.S., but local factors can perpetuate and influence the magnitude of disparate cancer outcomes. To some extent, high cancer mortality among racial and ethnic minority segments of the population is a national manifestation of a wide range of local problems. A promising strategy to address cancer disparities is to foster research to understand local patterns of cancer mortality and root causes of disparities, and to test interventions informed by those findings that account for the needs of the local community. This paradigm for addressing cancer disparities has been successfully employed by a large cadre of cancer researchers at the University of Illinois Cancer Center (UICC) for more than a decade and forms the basis of the UICC vision to be a “bench- to-community” NCI-designated cancer center. Governors State University (GSU) has invested substantially in basic science and health science infrastructure, increased efforts to recruit faculty members with an interest in research, and significantly enhanced research support services over the past several years. As a result, GSU is positioned to address growing cancer disparities in their community. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop additional infrastructure that will build on the strengths of the partnering institutions in order to enhance their capacity to conduct cancer health inequities research that is driven by local data and informed by the cancer-related needs of local communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE (OVERALL): The GUIDE (GSU-UICC-Disparities-Education) Cancer Research Training Project is a collaborative initiative between GSU and UICC. The institutions will jointly conduct a pilot research project addressing a local, cancer-related health disparity and will develop a training program for GSU junior faculty and undergraduate students designed to attract and prepare investigators for careers in cancer disparities.",2/2 The GUIDE Cancer Research Training Project,9548993,P20CA202907,"['Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentors ', ' mortality ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' science education ', ' member ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' research study ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Localized Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Localized Malignancy ', ' Localized Cancer ', ' Local Cancer ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' R21 Award ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' recruit teachers ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' summer research ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority investigator ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' racial minority ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NCI,GOVERNORS STATE UNIVERSITY,P20,2018,204897,-0.012545005370573833
"1/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research Summary: The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) initiated their Partnership in August 2002. The early years of the Partnership during the U56 funding period (2005-2010) established the foundational support and scientific leadership needed to build a solid and vibrant research collaboration. Moving forward, the U54 mechanism drew on this foundation resulting in a robust set of activities in research, capacity building and outreach. Two key tenets guide this sustained partnership between UMass Boston and DF/HCC: a) A common and intense interest in addressing the problem of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality; and b) A belief that through the Partnership, each institution will achieve benefits that neither could achieve on its own. This application for renewal provides extensive evidence of the ways these tenets have been operationalized, the resulting benefits for both institutions and the ways in which this Partnership is now poised to make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control. We are proposing activities that draw on the latest science to understand and address cancer disparities through a transdisciplinary approach that embodies our Partnership theme of “Cells to Society.” In support of our new cohesive theme, we have proposed three sophisticated, highly competitive research projects across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. To elucidate new areas of research opportunity, the Partnership is excited to explore the intersection between biology-based sciences and social/behavioral sciences. The immediate priorities of the Partnership are: 1) Continuing capacity building for biomedical and cancer research at UMass Boston and cancer disparities research at DF/HCC; 2) Enhancing and scaling up research experiences for students with a specific focus on underrepresented minorities (URMs), across the entire educational pipeline –from undergraduate to postdoctoral levels (see Research Education Core); 3) Continuing close mentoring of early stage investigators with a focus on research and career development; 4) Building a strong and robust Outreach Core that draws on the state of the science from dissemination and implementation sciences (D&I) for building partnerships, translating knowledge and monitoring the results of the translation efforts to build and sustain capacity among community-based organizations (see Outreach Core); 5) Offering infrastructural support to U54 investigators through two service cores, including the Research Design and Analysis, and Genomics Cores (see Shared Resource Core); and 6) Ensuring sustainability for projects, Cores and research education programs via dedicated planning and execution of grant matching with NIH-mechanisms, foundation support and/or institutional support. Project Narrative: The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Partnership is committed to further developing a shared rigorous and collaborative transdisciplinary cancer and disparities-related research program that spans the continuum of “Cells to Society.” Sophisticated research projects are proposed across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. These projects, together with state-of-the-art Outreach and Research Education Cores and creative Research Design and Analysis and Genomics Shared Resources, will serve to build research capacity and infrastructure at UMass Boston, expand the cancer disparities platform and community outreach programs at DF/HCC; and make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control.","1/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research",9552053,U54CA156734,"['Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Boston ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Ramp ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' novel ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' Genomics ', ' statistical service ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Genomics Shared Resource ', ' Outreach Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' scale up ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' implementation science ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' personalized cancer treatment ', ' individualized cancer therapy ', ' personalized cancer therapy ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' education research ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,U54,2018,1786870,-0.03195902260653191
"2/2 NCCU-DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership ABSTRACT The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) – DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership (NCCU-DCI-CDTRP) is focused on developing infrastructure for translational cancer health disparities research, education and training and on performing two such pilot research projects, focusing on the molecular aspects underlying the increased lethality of prostate and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans, with direct application to prevention, detection and treatment. This Program is built on the long-standing relationship between the two Durham-based Institutions, less than four miles apart. NCCU is an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students (ISUPS), affiliated with the 17- member University of North Carolina system and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center (CC). The Partnership, focusing on translational cancer health disparities research and education and training of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage investigators (ESIs) in this field, which is described by the NIH Translational Research Working Group, will distinguish itself with synergistic complementarity to an existing U54 between NCCU and UNC, which focuses on sociocultural disparities research and education and training of undergraduate students. To this Partnership, the Biomanufacturing Research Institute and Technology Enterprise (BRITE) faculty at NCCU will bring a unique perspective from an ISUPS, expertise in pharmaceuticals, drug discovery and development, as well as existing extensive health disparities education and training programs. The CC, DCI, will bring a unique distinguishing focus on biospecimen collection, correlative science in the context of clinical trials, development of racially diverse cancer patient-derived models and programs addressing minority accrual to treatment and biospecimen collection clinical trials. Development of the Partnership occurred and is continuing around planning and priority- setting stages, including selection of co-developed, collaborative pilot research projects and creation of a fully integrated, bi-directional, mutually beneficial Cancer Research Education Program (CREP). The Implementation stage will launch the pilot research projects, utilizing nearly 25 Shared Resources between NCCU and Duke, the CREP and the engagement of underserved minority populations across the region and state, with complementary existing programming mutually emanating from NCCU, which directly serves a minority community, and DCI's Office of Health Equity and Disparities. The Partnership will be led by an integrated Administrative Core of senior investigators who will serve as mentors to ESIs, rigorously addressing career development, to postdoctoral fellows and to graduate students and will include an extensive Evaluation Program for tracking impact and outcomes. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), an External Advisory Committee (EAC), focused solely on scientific guidance, and a Community Advisory Board (CAB). This NCI P20 collaborative partnership, “North Carolina Central University–Duke Cancer Institute Cancer Disparities Translational Research Program” (NCCU-DCI CDTRP), is relevant to cancer health disparities research, education and training. Regarding research, this application’s Pilot Projects focus on understanding and modulating molecular pathways in human tumors that contribute to the increased lethality of prostate cancer and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans. Elucidating these pathways will contribute to better prevention, detection and treatment of these cancers. The Administrative Core and aforementioned Pilot Projects will be done by DCI, a NCI- designated Cancer Center, and NCCU, an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students, in collaboration. Finally, a bi-directional Cancer Research Education Program is integrated to train the next generation of underserved and minority graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage faculty

"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center (SC CaDRe) SUMMARY This five-year U54 proposal is a collaborative, inter-institutional partnership between South Carolina State University (SCSU), an Historically Black University (HBCU), and the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC-HCC), a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. The partnership began in 2011 under the auspices of an NCI P20 CPACHE grant and has grown to produce this U54 South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center (SC CADRE) application. With input from their joint community partner, the Regional Medical Center of Orangeburg Mabry Cancer Center (RMC-MCC), investigators at both institutions collaborated to design the SC CADRE. The overarching goals of the SC CADRE are to increase SCSU's capacity to conduct transdisciplinary cancer research and to further strengthen and extend a longitudinal research education pipeline that will catalyze a new diverse generation of biomedical researchers focused on cancer disparities. The SC CADRE has three major themes. The first focuses on evaluating the relationship between obesity and prostate and breast cancer disparities. The second theme emphasizes evaluation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) as a novel biomarker related to cancer, cancer disparities, and obesity. The third theme highlights the inclusion of a population unique to the US southeastern coastal region, the Sea Island (SI)/Gullah population. Within five years, the SC CADRE aims for: 1) further elucidation of molecular mechanisms contributing to cancer disparities; 2) an enhanced pipeline of diverse cancer researchers; 3) an increased number of NIH research proposals led by SCSU faculty as independent investigators; and 4) greater community engagement in cancer research.

"2/2 Southeast Partnership for Improving Research & Training in Cancer Health Disparities The Southeast Partnership for Improving Research & Training in Cancer Health Disparities (SPIRIT- CHD) unites the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC), an institution serving underserved populations and underrepresented students (ISUPS), and the NCI-designated Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) to advance translational research on the biological mechanisms of cancer health disparities focusing on biospecimen-based research and precision medicine. It also seeks to establish a joint cancer research education program focused on biobanking and precision medicine education. LSUHSC serves a region characterized by an underserved African-American population, and rampant cancer health disparities in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. This region has several growing racial/ethnic minority populations. After Hurricane Katrina, the Hispanic population in Louisiana doubled and is now the fastest growing ethnic minority. MCC is located in Tampa, Florida and serves an increasingly wide catchment area characterized by a population diverse in regard to age, race/ethnicity, language and literacy, and is home to an increasing Latino population. Precision medicine research requires: a well-managed, ethnically and racially diverse biospecimen repository; state of the art technology in genomics, epigenomics and ancestry analysis; availability of language, cultural and literacy specific educational tools and resources; and a research education infrastructure that promotes a pipeline of trainees in cancer disparities research. MCC is a national leader and pioneer in these areas, has highly integrated research programs, and seeks to expand the diversity of their biospecimen research endeavors. This partnership is based on two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Plan and execute two collaborative pilot research projects. The first pilot research project focuses on breast cancer genomics, studying biospecimens from Hispanic/Latina patients of mixed genetic ancestry (African, Native American, European) by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and methylation analysis, to study correlations between molecular subtypes, gene expression profiles, clinical outcomes and ancestry. This project will support the career development of racial/ethnic minority early-stage investigators at LSUHSC and MCC. Specific Aim 2: Plan a collaborative three-pronged cancer research education program that includes: 1) a hands-on summer research experience for undergraduate and medical students; 2) delivery of a curriculum to those students focusing on biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities; and 3) expansion of outreach education to our respective communities about biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities. The combination of these collaborative partnership activities is expected to offer mutual benefit to each institution to impact cancer health disparities, inspire the next generation of researchers, and rapidly lead to the submission of competitive grant applications. Importantly, our main collaborative goal is to bring the benefits of cancer research advancements to underserved communities. Narrative - Overall The Southeast Partnership for Improving Research and Training in Cancer Health Disparities (SPIRIT-CHD) is a formal partnership between the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, an institution serving underserved populations and underrepresented students (ISUPS), and the NCI-designated Moffitt Cancer Center. The SPIRIT-CHD will reduce cancer health disparities in underserved and underrepresented populations by conducting precision medicine/Biospecimen-based research in underserved patient populations that are currently not represented in molecular databases. The SPIRIT-CHD will also develop a joint cancer research education program comprised of summer research experiences, development of a precision medicine/biospecimen curriculum, and delivery of outreach education to the public.",2/2 Southeast Partnership for Improving Research & Training in Cancer Health Disparities,9767095,P20CA202922,"['Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast

"Multidisciplinary Educational Approach to Reducing Cancer Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Increasing the diversity of cancer researchers and clinicians is a key strategy for finding innovative cancer control solutions and reducing cancer disparities. This Youth Enjoy Science Research Education (YES) Program will increase the diversity of University of California San Diego (UCSD) graduates who are pursuing graduate/professional training in the sciences. This YES Program is grounded on the Transformative Learning Theory and UCSD's 16 years of experience conducting UCSD's successful CURE Program. This YES Program will increase the number of women and underrepresented students from diverse scientific disciplines who are prepared for graduate school admission, with a focus on addressing cancer and cancer disparities. Specifically, YES students participate in classroom and laboratory learning activities that raise their understanding of cancer and the nation's and the world's cancer disparities. Thus, cancer disparities and how they are identified and resolved become the common theme that interconnects this YES Program's various learning activities. Students approach the issues related to cancer disparities, from the perspective of their individual laboratory training, classes and workshops, their own cultural backgrounds, community outreach events they deploy, and their chosen academic and professional pathways. San Diego's three NCI-designated cancer centers (UCSD, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, and Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute) invite the YES students to work and learn in the basic, behavioral, clinical and translational cancer research labs of their top cancer researchers. In their labs and classrooms, the YES students gain a solid understanding of cancer and the many bio-behavioral issues related to the development and exacerbation of cancer disparities and the possible resolutions. With this information and their literature review, students learn how to work on multidisciplinary teams as they develop programs to help reduce their community's cancer morbidity and mortality rates. Through these activities, students learn that, throughout their lives, they can play a role in reducing cancer disparities. To help YES students' reach their full academic, personal, and professional potential, they are also offered supplementary learning experiences, e.g., public speaking, goal setting and time management, writing, conducting literature search and synthesis skills, and experiences presenting and discussing their research work with professional and lay audiences. Students also prepare and submit abstracts to present their research findings at research symposia and national scientific meetings. Mentoring of the YES Program students, continues throughout their time at UCSD and on to graduate school. Thus, the premise of this YES program is that this learning opportunity will give the students hands-on research experiences and skills that will help them to secure admission to graduate level STEM programs and careers in cancer control research, always with a focus on reducing cancer disparities. San Diego’s three NCI-designated Cancer Centers are collaborating in this Youth Enjoy Science Research Education (YES) Program, an intensive, laboratory, classroom, and community-based learning opportunity to help UCSD students from underrepresented communities advance to the graduate levels of education needed to pursue cancer-related health and science careers. Student participants are matched with faculty research mentors who give the students hands-on experiences in cancer-related research and discuss how their lab’s research focus could help address cancer disparities. Students’ classroom and workshops teach students about cancer disparities and give students hands-on experiences creating and delivering interventions to help reduce cancer disparities in their community.",Multidisciplinary Educational Approach to Reducing Cancer Disparities,9633889,R25CA221779,"['age group ', ' experience ', ' religious group ', ' science education ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' theories ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' nanotechnological ', ' nanotech ', ' nano-technological ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' drug discovery ', ' Drops ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' tumor registry ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical care ', ' Secure ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' hands-on learning ', ' interactive learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' applied learning ', ' faculty research ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' laboratory experience ', ' laboratory training ', ' lab experience ', ' training opportunity ', ' hands on research ', ' education research ', ' academic preparation ', ' academic readiness ', ' Student recruitment ', ' translational cancer research ', ' recruit ', ' implementation strategy ', ' STEM program ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics program ', ' science, technology, engineering and math program ', ' meetings ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Awareness ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Dentistry ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Engineering ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Play ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Schedule ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Time Management ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Research Activity ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Review Literature ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Public Speaking ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Event ', ' Country ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R25,2019,471463,0.015652862289621997
"2/2, University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry is a highly underserved minority with a significant, disparate burden of cancer. In addition, they are also highly underrepresented among cancer researchers and cancer health care professionals. The University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) have been engaged in a unique and successful partnership over the past twelve years, currently supported by a U54 grant. As the only U54 Partnership addressing cancer health disparities in Pacific Islanders, the UOG/UHCC Partnership is characterized by a significant number of very distinctive aspects and opportunities. In particular, 37% of the Guam population is represented by indigenous Chamorros/part-Chamorros, while 38% are Filipino and Micronesian. The unique ethnic characteristics of this UOG/UHCC Partnership are paralleled by its unique geographic characteristics (the region covered by HI, GU, and U.S. Pacific Territories/jurisdictions), as well as unique regional opportunities for research, education, and outreach. The UOG/UHCC Partnership has indeed been transformational for the UOG and the Territory of Guam as specified in UOG's Letter of Commitment, including the establishment of a Cancer Research Center at UOG and implementation of legislation markedly increasing taxes on tobacco products. At UHCC the U54 has resulted in increased cancer health disparities research in Pacific Islanders. In this U54 renewal application, our overarching goal is to establish our Partner- ship as the national and international leader in advancing cancer health equity in Pacific Islanders. To achieve this goal we will build upon the success of the last five and a half years. All Specific Aims of the individual components of our application support our overall objectives, namely 1) to continue to develop the cancer re- search capability and competitiveness of faculty at UOG by increasing the number of UOG faculty with investigator-initiated funding and peer-reviewed publications; 2) to further develop the focus of UHCC research on cancer health disparities, with particular emphasis on Pacific Islanders and related topics of regional relevance such as betel nut chewing and cervical cancer screening and prevention; 3) To continue raising the awareness of cancer and cancer prevention in the multiethnic communities served by UOG and UHCC, with emphasis on Pacific Islanders; and 4) to increase the number of cancer and biomedical science researchers of Pacific Is- lander ancestry in the U.S. by continuing our successful MA, MS, and PhD training programs for Pacific Is- lander students in cancer-related fields, as well as providing guidance to early stage faculty investigators. The leadership at UOG and UHCC are highly committed to this Partnership as evidenced by their strong Letters of Support and the commitment of significant resources to the Partnership. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This grant has supported the only cancer research infrastructure established west of Hawaii, in the U.S. Territory of Guam. Continued funding will support three research projects described herein, focusing on cancers of regional significance. The partnership provides opportunities for faculty as well as pre-doctoral and post-doctoral students to develop and strengthen skills in project design and administration, team collaboration, recruitment and retention, specimen collection, data analysis, manuscript writing, grantsmanship among others. Early stage and senior investigators at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center will gain opportunities to work with new populations in the Hawaii-Pacific region, including Chamorros, Chuukese and Marshallese, and establish collaborations with UOG faculty who share interests in cancer health disparities research.","2/2, University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership",9767033,U54CA143728,"['Accreditation ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Hawaii ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' chews ', ' chewed ', ' Chewing ', ' Mastication ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Nuts ', ' Pacific Islands ', ' Peer Review ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Taxes ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' skills ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Indigenous ', ' International ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Center of Hawaii ', ' CRCH ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Characteristics ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' doctoral student ', ' PhD. student ', ' PhD student ', ' Ph.D. student ', ' Ph.D student ', ' Ph.

"2/2 NCCU-DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership ABSTRACT The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) – DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership (NCCU-DCI-CDTRP) is focused on developing infrastructure for translational cancer health disparities research, education and training and on performing two such pilot research projects, focusing on the molecular aspects underlying the increased lethality of prostate and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans, with direct application to prevention, detection and treatment. This Program is built on the long-standing relationship between the two Durham-based Institutions, less than four miles apart. NCCU is an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students (ISUPS), affiliated with the 17- member University of North Carolina system and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center (CC). The Partnership, focusing on translational cancer health disparities research and education and training of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage investigators (ESIs) in this field, which is described by the NIH Translational Research Working Group, will distinguish itself with synergistic complementarity to an existing U54 between NCCU and UNC, which focuses on sociocultural disparities research and education and training of undergraduate students. To this Partnership, the Biomanufacturing Research Institute and Technology Enterprise (BRITE) faculty at NCCU will bring a unique perspective from an ISUPS, expertise in pharmaceuticals, drug discovery and development, as well as existing extensive health disparities education and training programs. The CC, DCI, will bring a unique distinguishing focus on biospecimen collection, correlative science in the context of clinical trials, development of racially diverse cancer patient-derived models and programs addressing minority accrual to treatment and biospecimen collection clinical trials. Development of the Partnership occurred and is continuing around planning and priority- setting stages, including selection of co-developed, collaborative pilot research projects and creation of a fully integrated, bi-directional, mutually beneficial Cancer Research Education Program (CREP). The Implementation stage will launch the pilot research projects, utilizing nearly 25 Shared Resources between NCCU and Duke, the CREP and the engagement of underserved minority populations across the region and state, with complementary existing programming mutually emanating from NCCU, which directly serves a minority community, and DCI's Office of Health Equity and Disparities. The Partnership will be led by an integrated Administrative Core of senior investigators who will serve as mentors to ESIs, rigorously addressing career development, to postdoctoral fellows and to graduate students and will include an extensive Evaluation Program for tracking impact and outcomes. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), an External Advisory Committee (EAC), focused solely on scientific guidance, and a Community Advisory Board (CAB). This NCI P20 collaborative partnership, “North Carolina Central University–Duke Cancer Institute Cancer Disparities Translational Research Program” (NCCU-DCI CDTRP), is relevant to cancer health disparities research, education and training. Regarding research, this application’s Pilot Projects focus on understanding and modulating molecular pathways in human tumors that contribute to the increased lethality of prostate cancer and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans. Elucidating these pathways will contribute to better prevention, detection and treatment of these cancers. The Administrative Core and aforementioned Pilot Projects will be done by DCI, a NCI- designated Cancer Center, and NCCU, an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students, in collaboration. Finally, a bi-directional Cancer Research Education Program is integrated to train the next generation of underserved and minority graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage faculty

"Understanding and Addressing Cancer Health Disparities in Louisiana ABSTRACT: Cancer health disparities represent a major public health crisis in the state of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. The citizens of this region have to contend with cancer incidence and mortality rates that are among the highest in the nation. In addition, we have a very high incidence of specific malignancies that disproportionately affect minorities and the underserved citizens of the region. Triple negative breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, endometrial cancer, advanced prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, among others, are more common and appear to be more aggressive among minorities. Complex socio-economic and political reasons and an increase in co-morbidities, such as obesity, may in part help explain the origin of some of these health disparities. However, increasing evidence from genomics and cancer biology, including our work, has started to shed light on the biological basis for some of these inequities, and suggests specific interventions to help ameliorate the impact of these diseases and improve patient outcomes. We plan to use this P20 planning grant to establish research projects that bring together the best investigators and institutions in Louisiana who are conducting research on the genetics/genomics, immunology, and clinical and public health aspects of cancer with special emphasis on health disparities. Under the leadership of the LSU Stanley S. Scott Cancer Center in New Orleans (LSU-CC-NO) and in partnership with investigators from academic and medical institutions in the state, we have agreed to conduct research under the new Gulf South Center for Research and Solutions in Cancer Health Disparities (Gulf South-CARES-CHD). To ensure a focused and productive effort, this P20 grant we will study the genomic signature and inflammation characteristics of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a disease that disproportionately affects young African-American women in Louisiana. We believe that understanding the genomics and inflammatory biology of specific cancers may provide insights into mechanisms of resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and help identify and test potential interventions for improving the therapeutic efficacy of current and future treatments. Besides creating competitive teams of researchers, we will build the necessary intellectual and organizational infrastructure and develop the preliminary data to plan and support research projects that qualify for a SPORE application. Our combined expertise, the unique patient populations available in Louisiana, and the commitment of our institutions will enable us to achieve these goals, which will improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in underserved populations, both in Louisiana and globally. Cancers that cause major health disparities such as triple negative breast cancer, liver, endometrial, and advanced prostate cancer affect the African-American minority population, in particular women, in Louisiana. Although socioeconomic differences and access to health care have helped explain some of these inequalities, genomic and biological data may help explain the poor response to chemotherapy regimens and poor outcomes in these malignancies. We have created the Gulf South Center for Research and Solutions in Cancer Health Disparities (Gulf South-CARES-CHD), bringing together regional investigators conducting research in cancer health disparities to generate data for understanding the biological and social determinants of health disparities and developing new interventions and clinical trials that address these

"1/2 NCCU-DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership ABSTRACT The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) – DUKE Cancer Disparities Translational Research Partnership (NCCU-DCI-CDTRP) is focused on developing infrastructure for translational cancer health disparities research, education and training and on performing two such pilot research projects, focusing on the molecular aspects underlying the increased lethality of prostate and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans, with direct application to prevention, detection and treatment. This Program is built on the long-standing relationship between the two Durham-based Institutions, less than four miles apart. NCCU is an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students (ISUPS), affiliated with the 17-member University of North Carolina system and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center (CC). The Partnership, focusing on translational cancer health disparities research and education and training of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage investigators (ESIs) in this field, which is described by the NIH Translational Research Working Group, will distinguish itself with synergistic complementarity to an existing U54 between NCCU and UNC, which focuses on sociocultural disparities research and education and training of undergraduate students. To this Partnership, the Biomanufacturing Research Institute and Technology Enterprise (BRITE) faculty at NCCU will bring a unique perspective from an ISUPS, expertise in pharmaceuticals, drug discovery and development, as well as existing extensive health disparities education and training programs. The CC, DCI, will bring a unique distinguishing focus on biospecimen collection, correlative science in the context of clinical trials, development of racially diverse cancer patient-derived models and programs addressing minority accrual to treatment and biospecimen collection clinical trials. Development of the Partnership occurred and is continuing around planning and priority-setting stages, including selection of co-developed, collaborative pilot research projects and creation of a fully integrated, bi-directional, mutually beneficial Cancer Research Education Program (CREP). The Implementation stage will launch the pilot research projects, utilizing nearly 25 Shared Resources between NCCU and Duke, the CREP and the engagement of underserved minority populations across the region and state, with complementary existing programming mutually emanating from NCCU, which directly serves a minority community, and DCI’s Office of Health Equity and Disparities. The Partnership will be led by an integrated Administrative Core of senior investigators who will serve as mentors to ESIs, rigorously addressing career development, to postdoctoral fellows and to graduate students and will include an extensive Evaluation Program for tracking impact and outcomes. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), an External Advisory Committee (EAC), focused solely on scientific guidance, and a Community Advisory Board (CAB). This NCI P20 collaborative partnership, “North Carolina Central University–Duke Cancer Institute Cancer Disparities Translational Research Program” (NCCU-DCI CDTRP), is relevant to cancer health disparities research, education and training. Regarding research, this application’s Pilot Projects focus on understanding and modulating molecular pathways in human tumors that contribute to the increased lethality of prostate cancer and inflammatory breast cancer in African Americans. Elucidating these pathways will contribute to better prevention, detection and treatment of these cancers. The Administrative Core and aforementioned Pilot Projects will be done by DCI, a NCI- designated Cancer Center, and NCCU, an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students, in collaboration. Finally, a bi-directional Cancer Research Education Program is integrated to train the next generation of underserved and minority graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early stage faculty

"Building Partnerships and Competencies to Address Cancer Health Disparities: A Community Based Participatory Research Training Workshop for Clinicians Cancer health disparities are pervasive across the cancer continuum. Racial and ethnic minorities, as well as individuals who are medically underserved, are more likely to develop cancer, experience greater cancer- related morbidity, and are more likely to die from the disease. While the causes of disparities are complex, social determinants of health (SDOH), in essence, “the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life,” are thought to significantly contribute to the disproportionate cancer burden. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is an important approach in order to both understand the contribution of SDOH and to develop evidence-based interventions to reduce cancer disparities. Clinicians (e.g., physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, psychologists, social workers) are in the unique position to impact these disparities through both practice and research. However, these clinicians are unlikely to have received formal training in how to conduct CBPR. The proposed two and a half day workshop, ""Building Partnerships and Competencies to Address Cancer Health Disparities,"" will provide 45 clinicians with CBPR training. In order to foster knowledge acquisition and develop the skills necessary for meaningful CBPR, the workshop will include interactive discussions with nationally- recognized CBPR experts, clinician-scientists, and a community partner, a unique poverty simulation experience, and devoted time to develop their own study ideas and receive feedback on those ideas from CBPR experts. In addition, in order to accelerate the successful implementation of CBPR skills and the application of this new knowledge to research projects, clinicians will be paired with a mentor through the NIH- funded National Research Mentoring Network and have the opportunity to receive peer support through quarterly post-workshop videoconference calls. Our proposed workshop has the following Specific Aims: 1) To increase knowledge about CBPR principles, SDOH, and cancer health disparities and foster practical application of CBPR principles through training, skill building, and feedback in order to improve skills for conducting meaningful and impactful community-engaged cancer research among a cohort of clinicians interested in adding a research component to their careers; and 2) To provide workshop participants opportunities for ongoing CBPR mentorship and peer support to facilitate and accelerate the application of their acquired knowledge and skills to real-world cancer health disparities research projects. Through this workshop, clinicians from across the country will be provided with the skills and ongoing mentorship necessary to affect change through the development of partnerships with community members and organizations and the design of impactful community-engaged research in order to reduce cancer health disparities. Community-based participatory research is effective in reducing cancer health disparities across the cancer continuum. Increasingly, clinicians—the individuals on the front lines of community healthcare—such as physicians, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, and social workers seek to conduct meaningful research in partnership with the community, but are often not formally prepared to conduct community-engaged research. As such, the proposed workshop, ""Building Partnerships and Competencies to Address Cancer Health Disparities,"" aims to train clinician-scientists through a variety of interactive formats so that they may successfully apply community-based participatory research principles in order to reduce health disparities.",Building Partnerships and Competencies to Address Cancer Health Disparities: A Community Based Participatory Research Training Workshop for Clinicians,9836967,R13CA232431,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Community Participation ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Dentists ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Knowledge acquisition ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Social Workers ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' United States ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Competence ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' lectures ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' skills training ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Videoconferences ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Clinical Services ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' clinical practice ', ' social health determinants ', ' peer support ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R13,2019,25000,0.052454339163898384
"1/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research Summary: The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) initiated their Partnership in August 2002. The early years of the Partnership during the U56 funding period (2005-2010) established the foundational support and scientific leadership needed to build a solid and vibrant research collaboration. Moving forward, the U54 mechanism drew on this foundation resulting in a robust set of activities in research, capacity building and outreach. Two key tenets guide this sustained partnership between UMass Boston and DF/HCC: a) A common and intense interest in addressing the problem of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality; and b) A belief that through the Partnership, each institution will achieve benefits that neither could achieve on its own. This application for renewal provides extensive evidence of the ways these tenets have been operationalized, the resulting benefits for both institutions and the ways in which this Partnership is now poised to make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control. We are proposing activities that draw on the latest science to understand and address cancer disparities through a transdisciplinary approach that embodies our Partnership theme of “Cells to Society.” In support of our new cohesive theme, we have proposed three sophisticated, highly competitive research projects across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. To elucidate new areas of research opportunity, the Partnership is excited to explore the intersection between biology-based sciences and social/behavioral sciences. The immediate priorities of the Partnership are: 1) Continuing capacity building for biomedical and cancer research at UMass Boston and cancer disparities research at DF/HCC; 2) Enhancing and scaling up research experiences for students with a specific focus on underrepresented minorities (URMs), across the entire educational pipeline –from undergraduate to postdoctoral levels (see Research Education Core); 3) Continuing close mentoring of early stage investigators with a focus on research and career development; 4) Building a strong and robust Outreach Core that draws on the state of the science from dissemination and implementation sciences (D&I) for building partnerships, translating knowledge and monitoring the results of the translation efforts to build and sustain capacity among community-based organizations (see Outreach Core); 5) Offering infrastructural support to U54 investigators through two service cores, including the Research Design and Analysis, and Genomics Cores (see Shared Resource Core); and 6) Ensuring sustainability for projects, Cores and research education programs via dedicated planning and execution of grant matching with NIH-mechanisms, foundation support and/or institutional support. Project Narrative: The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Partnership is committed to further developing a shared rigorous and collaborative transdisciplinary cancer and disparities-related research program that spans the continuum of “Cells to Society.” Sophisticated research projects are proposed across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. These projects, together with state-of-the-art Outreach and Research Education Cores and creative Research Design and Analysis and Genomics Shared Resources, will serve to build research capacity and infrastructure at UMass Boston, expand the cancer disparities platform and community outreach programs at DF/HCC; and make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control.","1/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research",9784582,U54CA156734,"['Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Boston ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Ramp ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' novel ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' Genomics ', ' statistical service ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Genomics Shared Resource ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' scale up ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' implementation science ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' personalized cancer therapy ', ' personalized cancer treatment ', ' individualized cancer therapy ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' education research ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,U54,2019,1650030,-0.03195902260653191

"2/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE        Project Narrative: The presence of major cancer health inequities in Chicago is well-documented. This proposed 3 institutional partnership poses a strong and important approach for reducing deeply-engrained disparities. CCPACHE is a partnership in research, education, and community outreach aimed directly at building and fostering the next generation pipeline of students and faculty entering health-related careers, increasing the number of cancer health disparities researchers, and facilitating the translation of cancer research that is directly informed by, and relevant to, Chicagoland communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",2/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity,9768389,U54CA202995,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Mission ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' forging ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' Minority Graduate Student ', ' minority graduate ', ' community center ', ' student training ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,U54,2019,785522,-0.016855895909280497
"2/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) initiated their Partnership in August 2002. The early years of the Partnership during the U56 funding period (2005-2010) established the foundational support and scientific leadership needed to build a solid and vibrant research collaboration. Moving forward, the U54 mechanism drew on this foundation resulting in a robust set of activities in research, capacity building and outreach. Two key tenets guide this sustained partnership between UMass Boston and DF/HCC: a) A common and intense interest in addressing the problem of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality; and b) A belief that through the Partnership, each institution will achieve benefits that neither could achieve on its own. This application for renewal provides extensive evidence of the ways these tenets have been operationalized, the resulting benefits for both institutions and the ways in which this Partnership is now poised to make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control. We are proposing activities that draw on the latest science to understand and address cancer disparities through a transdisciplinary approach that embodies our Partnership theme of “Cells to Society. In support of our new cohesive theme, we have proposed three sophisticated, highly competitive research projects across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. To elucidate new areas of research opportunity, the Partnership is excited to explore the intersection between biology-based sciences and social/behavioral sciences. The immediate priorities Summary: ” of the Partnership are: 1) Continuing capacity building for biomedical and cancer research at UMass Boston and cancer disparities research at DF/HCC; 2) Enhancing and scaling up research experiences for students with a specific focus on underrepresented minorities (URMs), across the entire educational pipeline –from undergraduate to postdoctoral levels (see Research Education Core); 3) Continuing close mentoring of early stage investigators with a focus on research and career development; 4) Building a strong and robust Outreach Core that draws on the state of the science from dissemination and implementation sciences (D&I) for building partnerships, translating knowledge and monitoring the results of the translation efforts to build and sustain capacity among community-based organizations (see Outreach Core); 5) Offering infrastructural support to U54 investigators through two service cores, including the Research Design and Analysis, and Genomics Cores (see Shared Resource Core); and 6) Ensuring sustainability for projects, Cores and research education programs via dedicated planning and execution of grant matching with NIH-mechanisms, foundation support and/or institutional support. Project Narrative: The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Partnership is committed to further developing a shared rigorous and collaborative transdisciplinary cancer and disparities-related research program that spans the continuum of “Cells to Society.” Sophisticated research projects are proposed across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. These projects, together with state-of-the-art Outreach and Research Education Cores and creative Research Design and Analysis and Genomics Shared Resources, will serve to build research capacity and infrastructure at UMass Boston, expand the cancer disparities platform and community outreach programs at DF/HCC; and make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control.","2/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research",9768372,U54CA156732,"['Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Boston ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Ramp ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' novel ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' Genomics ', ' statistical service ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Genomics Shared Resource ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' scale up ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' implementation science ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' personalized cancer therapy ', ' personalized cancer treatment ', ' individualized cancer therapy ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' education research ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,U54,2019,2193200,-0.03162028340132182
"Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in a diverse cohort of Asian Americans PROJECT SUMMARY Over one in four Asian Americans who survive to age 65 can expect to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), yet Asian Americans are under-represented in ADRD research, and heterogeneity in risk across Asian ethnic groups is poorly understood. In the most comprehensive study to date, our research team discovered marked differences in ADRD incidence between Asian American ethnic groups (ADRD incidence was 27% higher in Filipino Americans than Chinese Americans). Despite the major differences in ADRD risk between groups, all Asian ethnic groups had lower ADRD risk than non-Latino whites (25% higher rate in non-Latino whites than Asian Americans). These findings have major public health implications: reducing ADRD rates in all racial/ethnic groups to rates observed in Asian Americans would prevent >190,000 ADRD cases annually in the U.S. Yet it is unknown why Asian Americans have lowered ADRD incidence or why Asian ethnic groups differ. Disentangling these puzzles will inform our understanding of the determinants of ADRD in people of all racial/ethnic backgrounds and help address the major gap in research on drivers of health in Asian Americans, the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the U.S. The overall objective of this application is to examine how social factors, cardiometabolic health, and genetic factors contribute to lower ADRD risk in Asian Americans and differences in risk between Asian ethnic groups (Filipino Americans, Chinese Americans, and Japanese Americans). The rationale for the proposed research is that delineating risk and protective factors for ADRD in Asian Americans will unlock why Asian Americans have lower ADRD risk than other racial/ethnic groups and identify potential strategies to prevent ADRD and reduce ADRD disparities. We have assembled survey data, neighborhood information, and 24 years of medical records on ~12,000 Filipino, Japanese, and Chinese American Kaiser health plan members that will be matched 1:3 to a sample of non-Latino whites. Further, approximately 25% of the sample has genotype data available. This is the largest, most diverse longitudinal sample of Asian Americans with a rich set of biomedical and social data relevant to ADRD available. Our Specific Aims are: 1) evaluate the role of social factors (generational status, educational attainment, income, neighborhood disadvantage metrics, neighborhood ethnic enclaves) on ADRD risk in Asian Americans; 2) evaluate the role of cardiometabolic health (diabetes, hypertension, stroke) on ADRD risk in Asian Americans; 3) determine whether genetic ancestry and APOE genotype influence variation in ADRD incidence observed in Asian Americans. Examining the roles of social, cardiometabolic, and genetic factors on ADRD risk in a large, diverse cohort of Asian Americans and whites will provide valuable information to prevent ADRD in people of all racial/ethnic backgrounds and reduce ADRD disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a major public health problem. Including more racially and socially diverse populations in research provides major opportunities for understanding the determinants of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The results of this project will provide valuable information on potential strategies to prevent Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in people of all racial/ethnic backgrounds and to reduce disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.",Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in a diverse cohort of Asian Americans,9799599,R01AG063969,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Chinese American ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Japanese American ', ' Medical Records ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Phillippines ', ' Phillipines ', ' Philipines ', ' Philippines ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apoE epsilon 4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' APOEε4 ', ' APOE\xa0e4 ', ' APOE-ε4 ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Filipino ', ' Immigrant ', ' Genetic ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Filipino American ', ' cohort ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' discount ', ' discounting ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health plan ', ' health plans ', ' protective factors ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,515950,0.011619951022820206
"1/2 TUFCCC/HC Regional Comprehensive Cancer Health Disparity Partnership PROJECT SUMMARY Overall TUFCCC: Grace X. Ma, PhD (Contact PI) and Jean-Pierre Issa, MD (MPI)  HC: Olorunseun O. Ogunwobi, MD, PhD (Contact PI) and Joel Erblich, PhD, MPH (MPI) Despite advances in early detection and treatment of cancer, significant racial/ethnic disparities exist in African, Asian-Pacific, and Hispanic Americans, bearing disproportionate cancer burden. These cancer health disparities are particularly salient in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-New York City (PNN) region, where there is a high concentration of minority populations compared to elsewhere in the U.S. Moreover, despite numerous academic institutions conducting biomedical research in PNN region, there is a critical dearth of underrepresented minorities (URMs) involved in cancer research, who bring unique scientific and cultural strengths necessary to conquer cancer health disparities. Building on collaborative history, successful and synergistic planning activities/accomplishments between TUFCCC and HC, and NCI-funded cancer disparities research networks (CNPC), we propose to establish TUFCCC/HC Regional Comprehensive Cancer Health Disparities Partnership to reduce cancer health disparities in PNN region. The goals of this Partnership are to: a) develop a strong and sustainable collaborative cancer health equity research infrastructure, b) support the development of outstanding URM students and ESIs who are committed to careers in cancer research, and c) collaboratively engage the community in enhancing quality and feasibility of these efforts. These goals will be achieved through the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create and enhance sustainable cancer disparity research collaborations in URM populations between TUFCCC and HC. Aim 1a. Enhance institutional cancer research capacity at HC in basic, behavioral and clinical cancer research and provide HC researchers with access to cancer core facilities, resources and expertise at TUFCCC. Aim 1b. Increase the number of research projects at TUFCCC that focus on cancer health disparities in underserved populations throughout the PNN region. Aim 2. Provide research education opportunities in cancer disparities to support a pipeline of diverse and URM undergraduate and graduate students at HC and TUFCCC. Aim 3. Establish a sustainable career development program to increase the number and diversity of investigators/ESIs to conduct cancer and cancer disparity research at both HC and TUFCCC. Aim 4. Use a Community-Based Participatory Research approach to engage researchers, students and community leaders to develop and implement culturally appropriate collaborative cancer outreach, research and education initiatives to increase access to, and utilization of cancer prevention, early detection and treatment in underserved disparity populations. To achieve U54 goals/aims, the Partnership includes two innovative and rigorous full research projects, a pilot project and a series of integrated cores, including Research Education, Planning and Evaluation, Community Outreach, and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics. Administrative Core will provide oversight and cohesion to the Partnership. Finally, the Partnership has a high level of institutional commitments from both TUFCCC and HC and is well positioned to make significant contributions to advancing cancer health equity in PNN region and beyond.

"Understanding and Addressing Cancer Health Disparities in Louisiana ABSTRACT: Cancer health disparities represent a major public health crisis in the state of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. The citizens of this region have to contend with cancer incidence and mortality rates that are among the highest in the nation. In addition, we have a very high incidence of specific malignancies that disproportionately affect minorities and the underserved citizens of the region. Triple negative breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, endometrial cancer, advanced prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, among others, are more common and appear to be more aggressive among minorities. Complex socio-economic and political reasons and an increase in co-morbidities, such as obesity, may in part help explain the origin of some of these health disparities. However, increasing evidence from genomics and cancer biology, including our work, has started to shed light on the biological basis for some of these inequities, and suggests specific interventions to help ameliorate the impact of these diseases and improve patient outcomes. We plan to use this P20 planning grant to establish research projects that bring together the best investigators and institutions in Louisiana who are conducting research on the genetics/genomics, immunology, and clinical and public health aspects of cancer with special emphasis on health disparities. Under the leadership of the LSU Stanley S. Scott Cancer Center in New Orleans (LSU-CC-NO) and in partnership with investigators from academic and medical institutions in the state, we have agreed to conduct research under the new Gulf South Center for Research and Solutions in Cancer Health Disparities (Gulf South-CARES-CHD). To ensure a focused and productive effort, this P20 grant we will study the genomic signature and inflammation characteristics of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a disease that disproportionately affects young African-American women in Louisiana. We believe that understanding the genomics and inflammatory biology of specific cancers may provide insights into mechanisms of resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and help identify and test potential interventions for improving the therapeutic efficacy of current and future treatments. Besides creating competitive teams of researchers, we will build the necessary intellectual and organizational infrastructure and develop the preliminary data to plan and support research projects that qualify for a SPORE application. Our combined expertise, the unique patient populations available in Louisiana, and the commitment of our institutions will enable us to achieve these goals, which will improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in underserved populations, both in Louisiana and globally. Cancers that cause major health disparities such as triple negative breast cancer, liver, endometrial, and advanced prostate cancer affect the African-American minority population, in particular women, in Louisiana. Although socioeconomic differences and access to health care have helped explain some of these inequalities, genomic and biological data may help explain the poor response to chemotherapy regimens and poor outcomes in these malignancies. We have created the Gulf South Center for Research and Solutions in Cancer Health Disparities (Gulf South-CARES-CHD), bringing together regional investigators conducting research in cancer health disparities to generate data for understanding the biological and social determinants of health disparities and developing new interventions and clinical trials that address these

"1/2 Southeast Partnership for Improving Research & Training in Cancer Health Disparities The Southeast Partnership for Improving Research & Training in Cancer Health Disparities (SPIRIT- CHD) unites the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC), an institution serving underserved populations and underrepresented students (ISUPS), and the NCI-designated Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) to advance translational research on the biological mechanisms of cancer health disparities focusing on biospecimen-based research and precision medicine. It also seeks to establish a joint cancer research education program focused on biobanking and precision medicine education. LSUHSC serves a region characterized by an underserved African-American population, and rampant cancer health disparities in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. This region has several growing racial/ethnic minority populations. After Hurricane Katrina, the Hispanic population in Louisiana doubled and is now the fastest growing ethnic minority. MCC is located in Tampa, Florida and serves an increasingly wide catchment area characterized by a population diverse in regard to age, race/ethnicity, language and literacy, and is home to an increasing Latino population. Precision medicine research requires: a well-managed, ethnically and racially diverse biospecimen repository; state of the art technology in genomics, epigenomics and ancestry analysis; availability of language, cultural and literacy specific educational tools and resources; and a research education infrastructure that promotes a pipeline of trainees in cancer disparities research. MCC is a national leader and pioneer in these areas, has highly integrated research programs, and seeks to expand the diversity of their biospecimen research endeavors. This partnership is based on two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Plan and execute two collaborative pilot research projects. The first pilot research project focuses on breast cancer genomics, studying biospecimens from Hispanic/Latina patients of mixed genetic ancestry (African, Native American, European) by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and methylation analysis, to study correlations between molecular subtypes, gene expression profiles, clinical outcomes and ancestry. This project will support the career development of racial/ethnic minority early-stage investigators at LSUHSC and MCC. Specific Aim 2: Plan a collaborative three-pronged cancer research education program that includes: 1) a hands-on summer research experience for undergraduate and medical students; 2) delivery of a curriculum to those students focusing on biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities; and 3) expansion of outreach education to our respective communities about biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities. The combination of these collaborative partnership activities is expected to offer mutual benefit to each institution to impact cancer health disparities, inspire the next generation of researchers, and rapidly lead to the submission of competitive grant applications. Importantly, our main collaborative goal is to bring the benefits of cancer research advancements to underserved communities. Narrative - Overall The Southeast Partnership for Improving Research and Training in Cancer Health Disparities (SPIRIT-CHD) is a formal partnership between the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, an institution serving underserved populations and underrepresented students (ISUPS), and the NCI-designated Moffitt Cancer Center. The SPIRIT-CHD will reduce cancer health disparities in underserved and underrepresented populations by conducting precision medicine/Biospecimen-based research in underserved patient populations that are currently not represented in molecular databases.

"University of California Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and  Trial Center (UCaMP) to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities OVERALL University of California Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (UCaMP) to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of UCaMP is to establish and characterize at least 200 patient-derived cancer xenografts (PDXs), and utilize these PDXs in preclinical testing of single agents and drug combinations that help guide future clinical decision-making emphasizing the largest racial/ethnic minority populations residing in California: Hispanic/Latino Americans [HLAs], Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander [AANHPIs], and African American [AAs] compared to Non-Hispanic Whites [NHWs]. We have established an accomplished transdisciplinary research team with an outstanding infrastructure that includes a University of California-wide central IRB system called Reliance and strong preliminary data to support the proposed PDX and cancer disparities research, thus allowing our results to be easily translated to clinical trials. UCaMP is comprised of four University of California NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers: UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UC Davis), UC Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCLA), UC Irvine Health Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UC Irvine), and UC San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCSF). Our collective strengths include complementary expertise in PDX development and drug testing, cancer health disparities, and clinical trial development robustly supported by cores for PDX, Pilot Studies, Bioinformatics, and Administration. We will achieve our goal through two Research Projects. Project 1 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX Models for Gastric and Liver Tumors, specifically addresses cancer health disparities in gastric cancers (GC) and liver cancers (LC) that disproportionately affect all racial/ethnic minorities especially in HLA and AANHPI populations. By understanding the genetic and response differences among HLA, AANHPI compared to NHWs, we could enhance the precision of therapeutic treatments, identify resistance-associated biomarkers, and study resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies. Project 2 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX Models for Lung and Bladder Tumors focuses on treatment disparities between AA and NHW patients to identify therapies targeting common genetic alterations (e.g. PI3K pathway) and to reveal targeted therapy resistance mechanisms for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and advanced bladder cancer (aBC). NARRATIVE The cumulative impact of UCaMP is the leverage of four University of California Comprehensive Centers in characterizing various drug treatment responses to minority patient-derived gastric, liver, bladder, and lung cancer models.

"(2/2) TUFCCC/HC Regional Comprehensive Cancer Health Disparity Partnership PROJECT SUMMARY Overall TUFCCC: Grace X. Ma, PhD (Contact PI) and Jean-Pierre Issa, MD (MPI)  HC: Olorunseun O. Ogunwobi, MD, PhD (Contact PI) and Joel Erblich, PhD, MPH (MPI) Despite advances in early detection and treatment of cancer, significant racial/ethnic disparities exist in African, Asian-Pacific, and Hispanic Americans, bearing disproportionate cancer burden. These cancer health disparities are particularly salient in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-New York City (PNN) region, where there is a high concentration of minority populations compared to elsewhere in the U.S. Moreover, despite numerous academic institutions conducting biomedical research in PNN region, there is a critical dearth of underrepresented minorities (URMs) involved in cancer research, who bring unique scientific and cultural strengths necessary to conquer cancer health disparities. Building on collaborative history, successful and synergistic planning activities/accomplishments between TUFCCC and HC, and NCI-funded cancer disparities research networks (CNPC), we propose to establish TUFCCC/HC Regional Comprehensive Cancer Health Disparities Partnership to reduce cancer health disparities in PNN region. The goals of this Partnership are to: a) develop a strong and sustainable collaborative cancer health equity research infrastructure, b) support the development of outstanding URM students and ESIs who are committed to careers in cancer research, and c) collaboratively engage the community in enhancing quality and feasibility of these efforts. These goals will be achieved through the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create and enhance sustainable cancer disparity research collaborations in URM populations between TUFCCC and HC. Aim 1a. Enhance institutional cancer research capacity at HC in basic, behavioral and clinical cancer research and provide HC researchers with access to cancer core facilities, resources and expertise at TUFCCC. Aim 1b. Increase the number of research projects at TUFCCC that focus on cancer health disparities in underserved populations throughout the PNN region. Aim 2. Provide research education opportunities in cancer disparities to support a pipeline of diverse and URM undergraduate and graduate students at HC and TUFCCC. Aim 3. Establish a sustainable career development program to increase the number and diversity of investigators/ESIs to conduct cancer and cancer disparity research at both HC and TUFCCC. Aim 4. Use a Community-Based Participatory Research approach to engage researchers, students and community leaders to develop and implement culturally appropriate collaborative cancer outreach, research and education initiatives to increase access to, and utilization of cancer prevention, early detection and treatment in underserved disparity populations. To achieve U54 goals/aims, the Partnership includes two innovative and rigorous full research projects, a pilot project and a series of integrated cores, including Research Education, Planning and Evaluation, Community Outreach, and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics. Administrative Core will provide oversight and cohesion to the Partnership. Finally, the Partnership has a high level of institutional commitments from both TUFCCC and HC and is well positioned to make significant contributions to advancing cancer health equity in PNN region and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE Overall Despite advances in cancer treatment and research, there are significant racial/ethnic cancer health disparities in cancer incidence and mortality, with African, Asian-Pacific, and Hispanic Americans bearing disproportionate cancer burden. Building on collaborative history, successful and synergistic planning activities/accomplishments between TUFCCC and HC, as well as NCI-supported cancer disparities research networks, we propose to establish TUFCCC/HC Regional Comprehensive Cancer Health Disparities Partnership to reduce cancer health disparities among underserved minority populations in Pennsylvania-New Jersey-New York City (PNN) region, through cancer disparities research, community outreach, and career development for underrepresented early stage investigators and students. The proposed U54 Partnership, in concert with two highly committed and collaborative institutions, is well positioned to jointly make significant contributions to advancing cancer health equity in the PNN region and beyond.",(2/2) TUFCCC/HC Regional Comprehensive Cancer Health Disparity Partnership,9787373,U54CA221704,"['Biomedical Research ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' mortality ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York City ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Program Development ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Students ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' African ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' cohesion ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' career development ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' education planning ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Core Facility ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Fox Chase Cancer Center ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer type ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' health equity ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' faculty mentor ', ' education research ', ' underserved minority ', ' translational scientist ', ' translational researcher ', ' translational investigator ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,HUNTER COLLEGE,U54,2019,1008081,0.0007703887642870285
"3/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE        Project Narrative: The presence of major cancer health inequities in Chicago is well-documented. This proposed 3 institutional partnership poses a strong and important approach for reducing deeply-engrained disparities. CCPACHE is a partnership in research, education, and community outreach aimed directly at building and fostering the next generation pipeline of students and faculty entering health-related careers, increasing the number of cancer health disparities researchers, and facilitating the translation of cancer research that is directly informed by, and relevant to, Chicagoland communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",3/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity,9769663,U54CA202997,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Mission ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' forging ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' Minority Graduate Student ', ' minority graduate ', ' community center ', ' student training ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,U54,2019,1466338,-0.016855895909280497
"South Carolina Cancer Health Equity Consortium (SC CHEC): Summer Undergraduate Research Training Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), the University of South Carolina (USC), and three historically black colleges/universities - Claflin University (CU), South Carolina State University (SCSU), and Voorhees College (VC) - have joined forces under the larger aegis of the South Carolina Cancer Health Equity Consortium (SC CHEC) to develop this application for an R25E NIH/NCI Cancer Education Grants Program. Together, these institutions have created an innovative, inter-institutional, 14-week summer course. This is combined with a hands-on laboratory research training platform and career mentoring by some of the nation's leading cancer researchers to attract and catalyze a new generation of diverse biomedical scientists. Within this new five-year initiative, 80 undergraduate juniors and seniors (designated as SC CHEC Student Fellows) from USC, CU, SCSU, and VC will engage with investigators at the MUSC Hollings Cancer Center, a National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated cancer center, to expose them to the latest advances in biomedical research spanning basic, clinical, and population sciences with an emphasis on cancer disparity dynamics in South Carolina (SC). The curriculum and training of this new initiative are focused on four of the most disparate cancers in terms of incidence, morbidity, and mortality in SC - breast, prostate, head/neck, and cervical cancer. Health outcomes for patients diagnosed with these four cancers are strongly influenced by race, ethnicity, urban/rural residence, socioeconomic position, and potentially biology. This R25E program's primary strategy will employ in-person classroom and laboratory instruction within the context of contemporary scientific approaches to cancer research at MUSC. These will be complemented by selected clinical and biotechnology-focused rotations, community engagement, and Graduate Record Examination preparation. The SC CHEC leadership strongly believes that promoting interest, career development, and commitment from the Millennial Generation (those born in the 1990s) to cancer biomedical and biobehavioral research is a critical step to attaining health equity and improved health outcomes in SC and beyond.

"University of California Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (UCaMP) to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities OVERALL University of California Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (UCaMP) to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of UCaMP is to establish and characterize at least 200 patient-derived cancer xenografts (PDXs), and utilize these PDXs in preclinical testing of single agents and drug combinations that help guide future clinical decision-making emphasizing the largest racial/ethnic minority populations residing in California: Hispanic/Latino Americans [HLAs], Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander [AANHPIs], and African American [AAs] compared to Non-Hispanic Whites [NHWs]. We have established an accomplished transdisciplinary research team with an outstanding infrastructure that includes a University of California-wide central IRB system called Reliance and strong preliminary data to support the proposed PDX and cancer disparities research, thus allowing our results to be easily translated to clinical trials. UCaMP is comprised of four University of California NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers: UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UC Davis), UC Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCLA), UC Irvine Health Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UC Irvine), and UC San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCSF). Our collective strengths include complementary expertise in PDX development and drug testing, cancer health disparities, and clinical trial development robustly supported by cores for PDX, Pilot Studies, Bioinformatics, and Administration. We will achieve our goal through two Research Projects. Project 1 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX Models for Gastric and Liver Tumors, specifically addresses cancer health disparities in gastric cancers (GC) and liver cancers (LC) that disproportionately affect all racial/ethnic minorities especially in HLA and AANHPI populations. By understanding the genetic and response differences among HLA, AANHPI compared to NHWs, we could enhance the precision of therapeutic treatments, identify resistance-associated biomarkers, and study resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies. Project 2 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX Models for Lung and Bladder Tumors focuses on treatment disparities between AA and NHW patients to identify therapies targeting common genetic alterations (e.g. PI3K pathway) and to reveal targeted therapy resistance mechanisms for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and advanced bladder cancer (aBC). NARRATIVE The cumulative impact of UCaMP is the leverage of four University of California Comprehensive Centers in characterizing various drug treatment responses to minority patient-derived gastric, liver, bladder, and lung cancer models. Together this research will contribute to elucidating biological determinants of cancer health disparities.",University of California Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial

"(1/2) Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership The Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU) and the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) have forged a strong working relationship founded on seamless communication with mutual support and benefits. With Partnership resources and significant commitment from both institutions, we have established joint programs enhancing basic and clinical research, enriching cancer outreach, expanding cancer education, and creating a unique Hispanic/Latino (H/L) Biobank, leading to the development of a robust network and infrastructure necessary for a sustained long-term collaboration to improve cancer outcomes in the H/L population. The U54 Partnership's immediate impact includes the identification of new mutations in breast and lung cancer in H/L patients, recruitment of new faculty essential for sustainability and growth, and 84 community outreach educational activities for H/Ls in Florida (FL) and Puerto Rico (PR). The development of the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB) and the training of clinical researchers, with 25 clinical intervention trials activated in Ponce, demonstrate the broad impact realized through the Partnership. Furthermore the Partnership had a critical role in the ACGME re-accreditation of the Hematology/Oncology Fellowship in PR, in the establishment of two stem cell transplant programs in PR by fellows trained in the MCC Bone Marrow Transplant unit, and in the establishment of an ACGME-accredited surgical residency in Ponce with surgical oncology rotations at MCC. The short-term metrics of the first 4 years of the U54 Partnership grant include 48 student participants, 35 peer-reviewed manuscripts published, and 29 grants funded out of a total of 64 submitted.  Our vision for the U54 PACHE renewal is to further grow and engage faculty and students in cancer precision medicine research that directly impacts the H/L populations in FL and PR. The Partnership has the requisite components to fully execute precision medicine in an underserved population—a biobank, quantitative science core (QSC) to analyze data, culturally sensitive outreach materials, expertise in the latest technologies, and a robust research portfolio. The four specific aims for the U54 Partnership renewal are the following. Aim 1: To increase the number of researchers at PHSU focused on basic/translational research in cancer and to augment the number of researchers in cancer health disparities at MCC. This is facilitated with joint projects in ovarian and breast cancer. Aim 2: To further develop outreach programs and research efforts in the H/L communities at both PHSU and MCC. An epidemiological project will examine the impact of receipt of MC1R genotypes on personal sun protection behaviors. Aim 3: To increase support for basic, translational and clinical research in the H/L population by establishing the QSC and further developing the PRBB. The MCC Total Cancer Care protocol will be developed in Ponce hospitals and leveraged by the PRBB to facilitate tissue collection. Aim 4: To provide comprehensive and structured student research education at both PHSU and MCC to facilitate the expansion and success of cancer researchers and clinicians in the H/L population. Over the last 10 years, the Ponce Health Sciences University in Puerto Rico and the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida have developed an exceptionally strong working relationship facilitated by the U56 Partnership Planning and U54 PACHE Comprehensive Partnership awards. The joint programs have resulted in successful outcomes in basic, translational, population and clinical research, as well as in cancer outreach, cancer education and training, and in biobanking. During the U54 Partnership renewal period there will be a focus on precision cancer medicine to address disparities regarding the representation of Hispanic/Latino populations in biorepositories and databases, and the “omics” analyses of tumor and normal tissues from this underrepresented group.",(1/2) Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership,9770775,U54CA163071,"['Accreditation ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Educational Activities ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Florida ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hematology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Island ', ' Joints ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Residencies ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Rotation ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Talents ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Technology ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Peer Review Grants ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Funding ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer care ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Stem cell transplant ', ' Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Progenitor Cell Transplantation ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Grant Review ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Surgical Oncology ', ' oncologic surgery ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' sun protection ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' tumor ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision oncology ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' precision cancer care ', ' personalized oncology ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' education research ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' ']",NCI,PONCE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2019,1656290,-0.048099802109092905
"1/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE        Project Narrative: The presence of major cancer health inequities in Chicago is well-documented. This proposed 3 institutional partnership poses a strong and important approach for reducing deeply-engrained disparities. CCPACHE is a partnership in research, education, and community outreach aimed directly at building and fostering the next generation pipeline of students and faculty entering health-related careers, increasing the number of cancer health disparities researchers, and facilitating the translation of cancer research that is directly informed by, and relevant to, Chicagoland communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",1/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity,9768978,U54CA203000,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Mission ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' forging ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' Minority Graduate Student ', ' minority graduate ', ' community center ', ' student training ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U54,2019,1231297,-0.016855895909280497
"1/2 SDSU/UCSD Cancer Center Comprehensive Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) OVERALL ABSTRACT: This application seeks funding to continue to support the SDSU/UCSD Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership. Our vision, consistent with that of the Comprehensive Partnership for the Advancement of Health Equity (CPACHE) program, is to continue to develop outstanding programs in research, research education, and community outreach in order to understand and address causes for cancer health disparities in our catchment areas of San Diego and Imperial counties, a region with a large and growing Hispanic/Latino population. As this population ages, the number of cancer cases is expected to grow. Addressing the existing gaps in research, education, and health care delivery in this ethnic group is a high priority of our Partnership, which leverages th distinct yet complementary strengths and resources of San Diego State University (SDSU), an officially designated Hispanic Serving Institution, and the University of California (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center (MCC), an NCI-designated Cancer Center. The goal of our Partnership is to reduce the burden of cancer among Hispanic/Latino communities in our catchment area. We accomplish this by building research and research education capacity and by continuing to improve outreach and education to underserved communities in our area, with a special emphasis on Hispanic/Latinos. The PIs represent an outstanding multidisciplinary team of experienced researchers and academic leaders in their own areas. Consistent with the overall goals of the CPACHE program and taking advantage of unique and complementary resources at SDSU and UCSD, we have established an outstanding scientific and leadership team. The complement of two population scientists (Drs. E. Martinez and E. Arredondo), a physician scientist (Dr. S. Crowe), and a basic scientist (Dr. M. Sussman) makes for an outstanding synergistic scientific team. The application includes two Full and one Pilot Project which were selected for their strong hypothesis-driven research aimed at enhancing research capacity at SDSU and increasing cancer disparities research at UCSD. This is complemented by a new Research Education program aimed at providing research experience in cancer and cancer disparities to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups who will be largely Hispanic/Latino. Finally, the Outreach Core involves a unique triad partnership that includes the MCC, SDSU, and federally qualified community health centers that serve the majority of uninsured and Medicaid insured Hispanic/Latinos in a large metropolitan area and along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Partnership has strong institutional commitment, a comprehensive planning and evaluation plan, and the guidance of an outstanding Internal Advisory Board and a stellar Program Steering Committee. There is sound rationale for the continuation of our Partnership as it has and will continue to provide unique, significant, and impactful programs in cancer research, research education, and community outreach.

"(1/2) University of Guam/University of Hawaii Cancer Center Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Project Summary/Abstract: Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry is a highly underserved minority with a significant, disparate burden of cancer. In addition, they are also highly underrepresented among cancer researchers and cancer health care professionals. The University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawaii Cancer Center (UHCC) have been engaged in a unique and successful partnership over the past twelve years, currently supported by a U54 grant. As the only U54 Partnership addressing cancer health disparities in Pacific Islanders, the UOG/UHCC Partnership is characterized by a significant number of very distinctive aspects and opportunities. In particular, 37% of the Guam population is represented by indigenous Chamorros/part-Chamorros, while 38% are Filipino and Micronesian. The unique ethnic characteristics of this UOG/UHCC Partnership are paralleled by its unique geographic characteristics (the region covered by HI, GU, and U.S. Pacific Territories/jurisdictions), as well as unique regional opportunities for research, education, and outreach. The UOG/UHCC Partnership has indeed been transformational for the UOG and the Territory of Guam as specified in UOG's Letter of Commitment, including the establishment of a Cancer Research Center at UOG and implementation of legislation markedly increasing taxes on tobacco products. At UHCC the U54 has resulted in increased cancer health disparities research in Pacific Islanders. In this U54 renewal application, our overarching goal is to establish our Partner- ship as the national and international leader in advancing cancer health equity in Pacific Islanders. To achieve this goal we will build upon the success of the last five and a half years. All Specific Aims of the individual components of our application support our overall objectives, namely 1) to continue to develop the cancer re- search capability and competitiveness of faculty at UOG by increasing the number of UOG faculty with investigator-initiated funding and peer-reviewed publications; 2) to further develop the focus of UHCC research on cancer health disparities, with particular emphasis on Pacific Islanders and related topics of regional relevance such as betel nut chewing and cervical cancer screening and prevention; 3) To continue raising the awareness of cancer and cancer prevention in the multiethnic communities served by UOG and UHCC, with emphasis on Pacific Islanders; and 4) to increase the number of cancer and biomedical science researchers of Pacific Is- lander ancestry in the U.S. by continuing our successful MA, MS, and PhD training programs for Pacific Is- lander students in cancer-related fields, as well as providing guidance to early stage faculty investigators. The leadership at UOG and UHCC are highly committed to this Partnership as evidenced by their strong Letters of Support and the commitment of significant resources to the Partnership. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative:  This grant has supported the only cancer research infrastructure established west of Hawaii, in the U.S. Territory of Guam.

"2/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Overall Abstract: Despite 5 major academic research-intensive medical centers, 2 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and millions of dollars in cancer research funding, Chicago consistently ranks in the upper quartile amongst the nation's worst cancer disparities. An under-tapped approach for addressing cancer disparities and advancing cancer health equity is the forging of strong bridges among the institutions that serve underrepresented populations with research intensive, NCI-designated cancer centers. Our collaborative aims to change the game in how we work toward eliminating Chicago's cancer health disparities by directly building and connecting bridges across 2 federally designated Hispanic Serving Institutions, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, the Northwestern University Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (NU RHLCCC).  This proposal describes the Midwest's first NCI U54 CPACHE to establish the Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity (CCPACHE), a comprehensive partnership for cancer research, education and training, and outreach. This collaborative partnership across Chicago combines the attributes of three exceptional institutions with unique capacity to interact with their urban-shared context and leverages established partnership infrastructure, including an NCI P20. UIC and NEIU hold outstanding track records of enrolling and graduating minority and nontraditional students across undergraduate through professional degree levels and have built longstanding partnerships with Chicago communities. Complementing the strengths of NEIU and UIC, NUI RHLCCC conducts a broad range of basic, clinical, and population science research and has expertise and experience to recruit and train students and faculty in cancer research.  Within the nurturing hub of four Cores, a pilot funding program, two initial proposed pilots, and one full research project, we seek to accomplish the following five aims: (1) to codify and sustain a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and NU RHLCCC in the pursuit of cancer health equity; (2) to establish an ongoing research pilot funding program that incubates and catalyzes multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research programs in cancer disparities; (3) to connect the research, education and training generated by this partnership to communities across Chicago by mobilizing Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in responsive ways, by defining cancer disparities at the local level, and by identifying broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research; (4) through enhanced education and training opportunities, to support a diverse pipeline of students entering the health and STEM related pipelines towards graduate degrees and careers in cancer research; and (5) to facilitate opportunities for skills training, education, and mentorship among UIC, NEIU and NU RHLCCC community members to develop scientists who will produce more competitive grant applications and succeed in securing extramural funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE        Project Narrative: The presence of major cancer health inequities in Chicago is well-documented. This proposed 3 institutional partnership poses a strong and important approach for reducing deeply-engrained disparities. CCPACHE is a partnership in research, education, and community outreach aimed directly at building and fostering the next generation pipeline of students and faculty entering health-related careers, increasing the number of cancer health disparities researchers, and facilitating the translation of cancer research that is directly informed by, and relevant to, Chicagoland communities most impacted by cancer disparities.",2/3: The Chicago Collaborative to Promote and Advance Cancer Health Equity,9830172,U54CA202995,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Mission ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Incubated ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' forging ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' next generation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' Hispanic-serving Institution ', ' Minority Graduate Student ', ' minority graduate ', ' community center ', ' student training ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,U54,2019,102118,-0.016855895909280497
"2/2 Ponce School of Medicine-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU) and the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) have forged a strong working relationship founded on seamless communication with mutual support and benefits. With Partnership resources and significant commitment from both institutions, we have established joint programs enhancing basic and clinical research, enriching cancer outreach, expanding cancer education, and creating a unique Hispanic/Latino (H/L) Biobank, leading to the development of a robust network and infrastructure necessary for a sustained long-term collaboration to improve cancer outcomes in the H/L population. The U54 Partnership’s immediate impact includes the identification of new mutations in breast and lung cancer in H/L patients, recruitment of new faculty essential for sustainability and growth, and 84 community outreach educational activities for H/Ls in Florida (FL) and Puerto Rico (PR). The development of the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB) and the training of clinical researchers, with 25 clinical intervention trials activated in Ponce, demonstrate the broad impact realized through the Partnership. Furthermore the Partnership had a critical role in the ACGME re-accreditation of the Hematology/Oncology Fellowship in PR, in the establishment of two stem cell transplant programs in PR by fellows trained in the MCC Bone Marrow Transplant unit, and in the establishment of an ACGME-accredited surgical residency in Ponce with surgical oncology rotations at MCC. The short-term metrics of the first 4 years of the U54 Partnership grant include 48 student participants, 35 peer-reviewed manuscripts published, and 29 grants funded out of a total of 64 submitted.  Our vision for the U54 PACHE renewal is to further grow and engage faculty and students in cancer precision medicine research that directly impacts the H/L populations in FL and PR. The Partnership has the requisite components to fully execute precision medicine in an underserved population—a biobank, quantitative science core (QSC) to analyze data, culturally sensitive outreach materials, expertise in the latest technologies, and a robust research portfolio. The four specific aims for the U54 Partnership renewal are the following. Aim 1: To increase the number of researchers at PHSU focused on basic/translational research in cancer and to augment the number of researchers in cancer health disparities at MCC. This is facilitated with joint projects in ovarian and breast cancer. Aim 2: To further develop outreach programs and research efforts in the H/L communities at both PHSU and MCC. An epidemiological project will examine the impact of receipt of MC1R genotypes on personal sun protection behaviors. Aim 3: To increase support for basic, translational and clinical research in the H/L population by establishing the QSC and further developing the PRBB. The MCC Total Cancer Care protocol will be developed in Ponce hospitals and leveraged by the PRBB to facilitate tissue collection. Aim 4: To provide comprehensive and structured student research education at both PHSU and MCC to facilitate the expansion and success of cancer researchers and clinicians in the H/L population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the last 10 years, the Ponce Health Sciences University in Puerto Rico and the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida have developed an exceptionally strong working relationship facilitated by the U56 Partnership Planning and U54 PACHE Comprehensive Partnership awards. The joint programs have resulted in successful outcomes in basic, translational, population and clinical research, as well as in cancer outreach, cancer education and training, and in biobanking. During the U54 Partnership renewal period there will be a focus on precision cancer medicine to address disparities regarding the representation of Hispanic/Latino populations in biorepositories and databases, and the “omics” analyses of tumor and normal tissues from this underrepresented group.",2/2 Ponce School of Medicine-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership,10007761,U54CA163068,"['Accreditation ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Florida ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hematology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Island ', ' Joints ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rotation ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Talents ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue repository ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Peer Review Grants ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer care ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Progenitor Cell Transplantation ', ' Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Stem cell transplant ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Grant Review ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' oncologic surgery ', ' Surgical Oncology ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' sun protection ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' tumor ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' screening ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' personalized oncology ', ' precision cancer care ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' precision oncology ', ' education research ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' data infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"1/2 TUFCCC/HC Regional Comprehensive Cancer Health Disparity Partnership PROJECT SUMMARY Overall TUFCCC: Grace X. Ma, PhD (Contact PI) and Jean-Pierre Issa, MD (MPI)  HC: Olorunseun O. Ogunwobi, MD, PhD (Contact PI) and Joel Erblich, PhD, MPH (MPI) Despite advances in early detection and treatment of cancer, significant racial/ethnic disparities exist in African, Asian-Pacific, and Hispanic Americans, bearing disproportionate cancer burden. These cancer health disparities are particularly salient in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-New York City (PNN) region, where there is a high concentration of minority populations compared to elsewhere in the U.S. Moreover, despite numerous academic institutions conducting biomedical research in PNN region, there is a critical dearth of underrepresented minorities (URMs) involved in cancer research, who bring unique scientific and cultural strengths necessary to conquer cancer health disparities. Building on collaborative history, successful and synergistic planning activities/accomplishments between TUFCCC and HC, and NCI-funded cancer disparities research networks (CNPC), we propose to establish TUFCCC/HC Regional Comprehensive Cancer Health Disparities Partnership to reduce cancer health disparities in PNN region. The goals of this Partnership are to: a) develop a strong and sustainable collaborative cancer health equity research infrastructure, b) support the development of outstanding URM students and ESIs who are committed to careers in cancer research, and c) collaboratively engage the community in enhancing quality and feasibility of these efforts. These goals will be achieved through the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create and enhance sustainable cancer disparity research collaborations in URM populations between TUFCCC and HC. Aim 1a. Enhance institutional cancer research capacity at HC in basic, behavioral and clinical cancer research and provide HC researchers with access to cancer core facilities, resources and expertise at TUFCCC. Aim 1b. Increase the number of research projects at TUFCCC that focus on cancer health disparities in underserved populations throughout the PNN region. Aim 2. Provide research education opportunities in cancer disparities to support a pipeline of diverse and URM undergraduate and graduate students at HC and TUFCCC. Aim 3. Establish a sustainable career development program to increase the number and diversity of investigators/ESIs to conduct cancer and cancer disparity research at both HC and TUFCCC. Aim 4. Use a Community-Based Participatory Research approach to engage researchers, students and community leaders to develop and implement culturally appropriate collaborative cancer outreach, research and education initiatives to increase access to, and utilization of cancer prevention, early detection and treatment in underserved disparity populations. To achieve U54 goals/aims, the Partnership includes two innovative and rigorous full research projects, a pilot project and a series of integrated cores, including Research Education, Planning and Evaluation, Community Outreach, and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics. Administrative Core will provide oversight and cohesion to the Partnership. Finally, the Partnership has a high level of institutional commitments from both TUFCCC and HC and is well positioned to make significant contributions to advancing cancer health equity in PNN region and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE Overall Despite advances in cancer treatment and research, there are significant racial/ethnic cancer health disparities in cancer incidence and mortality, with African, Asian-Pacific, and Hispanic Americans bearing disproportionate cancer burden. Building on collaborative history, successful and synergistic planning activities/accomplishments between TUFCCC and HC, as well as NCI-supported cancer disparities research networks, we propose to establish TUFCCC/HC Regional Comprehensive Cancer Health Disparities Partnership to reduce cancer health disparities among underserved minority populations in Pennsylvania-New Jersey-New York City (PNN) region, through cancer disparities research, community outreach, and career development for underrepresented early stage investigators and students.

"1/2 Southeast Partnership for Improving Research & Training in Cancer Health Disparities The Southeast Partnership for Improving Research & Training in Cancer Health Disparities (SPIRIT- CHD) unites the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC), an institution serving underserved populations and underrepresented students (ISUPS), and the NCI-designated Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) to advance translational research on the biological mechanisms of cancer health disparities focusing on biospecimen-based research and precision medicine. It also seeks to establish a joint cancer research education program focused on biobanking and precision medicine education. LSUHSC serves a region characterized by an underserved African-American population, and rampant cancer health disparities in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. This region has several growing racial/ethnic minority populations. After Hurricane Katrina, the Hispanic population in Louisiana doubled and is now the fastest growing ethnic minority. MCC is located in Tampa, Florida and serves an increasingly wide catchment area characterized by a population diverse in regard to age, race/ethnicity, language and literacy, and is home to an increasing Latino population. Precision medicine research requires: a well-managed, ethnically and racially diverse biospecimen repository; state of the art technology in genomics, epigenomics and ancestry analysis; availability of language, cultural and literacy specific educational tools and resources; and a research education infrastructure that promotes a pipeline of trainees in cancer disparities research. MCC is a national leader and pioneer in these areas, has highly integrated research programs, and seeks to expand the diversity of their biospecimen research endeavors. This partnership is based on two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Plan and execute two collaborative pilot research projects. The first pilot research project focuses on breast cancer genomics, studying biospecimens from Hispanic/Latina patients of mixed genetic ancestry (African, Native American, European) by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and methylation analysis, to study correlations between molecular subtypes, gene expression profiles, clinical outcomes and ancestry. This project will support the career development of racial/ethnic minority early-stage investigators at LSUHSC and MCC. Specific Aim 2: Plan a collaborative three-pronged cancer research education program that includes: 1) a hands-on summer research experience for undergraduate and medical students; 2) delivery of a curriculum to those students focusing on biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities; and 3) expansion of outreach education to our respective communities about biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities. The combination of these collaborative partnership activities is expected to offer mutual benefit to each institution to impact cancer health disparities, inspire the next generation of researchers, and rapidly lead to the submission of competitive grant applications. Importantly, our main collaborative goal is to bring the benefits of cancer research advancements to underserved communities. Narrative - Overall The Southeast Partnership for Improving Research and Training in Cancer Health Disparities (SPIRIT-CHD) is a formal partnership between the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, an institution serving underserved populations and underrepresented students (ISUPS), and the NCI-designated Moffitt Cancer Center. The SPIRIT-CHD will reduce cancer health disparities in underserved and underrepresented populations by conducting precision medicine/Biospecimen-based research in underserved patient populations that are currently not represented in molecular databases. The SPIRIT-CHD will also develop a joint cancer research education program comprised of summer research experiences, development of a precision medicine/biospecimen curriculum, and delivery of

"2/2 SDSU/UCSD Cancer Center Comprehensive Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) OVERALL ABSTRACT: This application seeks funding to continue to support the SDSU/UCSD Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership. Our vision, consistent with that of the Comprehensive Partnership for the Advancement of Health Equity (CPACHE) program, is to continue to develop outstanding programs in research, research education, and community outreach in order to understand and address causes for cancer health disparities in our catchment areas of San Diego and Imperial counties, a region with a large and growing Hispanic/Latino population. As this population ages, the number of cancer cases is expected to grow. Addressing the existing gaps in research, education, and health care delivery in this ethnic group is a high priority of our Partnership, which leverages th distinct yet complementary strengths and resources of San Diego State University (SDSU), an officially designated Hispanic Serving Institution, and the University of California (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center (MCC), an NCI-designated Cancer Center. The goal of our Partnership is to reduce the burden of cancer among Hispanic/Latino communities in our catchment area. We accomplish this by building research and research education capacity and by continuing to improve outreach and education to underserved communities in our area, with a special emphasis on Hispanic/Latinos. The PIs represent an outstanding multidisciplinary team of experienced researchers and academic leaders in their own areas. Consistent with the overall goals of the CPACHE program and taking advantage of unique and complementary resources at SDSU and UCSD, we have established an outstanding scientific and leadership team. The complement of two population scientists (Drs. E. Martinez and E. Arredondo), a physician scientist (Dr. S. Crowe), and a basic scientist (Dr. M. Sussman) makes for an outstanding synergistic scientific team. The application includes two Full and one Pilot Project which were selected for their strong hypothesis-driven research aimed at enhancing research capacity at SDSU and increasing cancer disparities research at UCSD. This is complemented by a new Research Education program aimed at providing research experience in cancer and cancer disparities to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups who will be largely Hispanic/Latino. Finally, the Outreach Core involves a unique triad partnership that includes the MCC, SDSU, and federally qualified community health centers that serve the majority of uninsured and Medicaid insured Hispanic/Latinos in a large metropolitan area and along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Partnership has strong institutional commitment, a comprehensive planning and evaluation plan, and the guidance of an outstanding Internal Advisory Board and a stellar Program Steering Committee. There is sound rationale for the continuation of our Partnership as it has and will continue to provide unique, significant, and impactful programs in cancer research, research education, and community outreach. Taken together, the new PI leadership has developed a strong renewal application that meets all the goals of the NCI U54 PACHE program.

"(2/2) Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE) PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL The Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE) is a 17-year collaboration between the University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) that continues to advance cancer health equity, increase the cancer research and education capacity, and decrease significant cancer disparities in Pacific Islands Populations. Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry are a highly underserved and vulnerable minority with a disparate cancer burden, including significant underrepresentation among cancer and biomedical researchers and healthcare providers, which further exacerbates the disparities. The overarching goal and long-term objective are to promote cancer health equity and mitigate the impact of cancer on Pacific Island Populations through increasing cancer research leadership and capacity in Hawai‘i, Guam and the United States Affiliated Pacific Islands, which comprise the Pacific Island Populations addressed by this project. As the only National Cancer Institute-funded Partnership serving the underrepresented Pacific Island region, PIPCHE will accomplish its goals through the following specific aims: (1) Continue to develop a diverse portfolio of Pacific Island Population-focused cancer research projects that include clinical, basic, and population health sciences, (2) Collaborate with local and regional Pacific Island community organizations that work with underrepresented Pacific Island Populations to promote cancer health equity and enhance opportunities for research training and workforce development, (3) Sustain, strengthen, and continuously evaluate of all the Partnership’s research, core activities, and research education programs, (4) Enhance and implement evidence-based, relevant, cancer-related public health interventions and cancer, prevention and control strategies with and within underrepresented communities, and (5) Expand the scientific collaboration among PIPCHE members and other faculty within the two institutions, with an emphasis on recruiting Early Stage Investigators of Pacific Island ancestry. PIPCHE will carry out these aims by continued investment in four Cores (Cancer Outreach, Research Education, Planning and Evaluation, and Administration), which provide the infrastructure and governance of the Partnership. The proposed Shared Resources (Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Information Technology, and Cancer Registry) will provide essential technical and scientific support to the PIPCHE student scholars, trainees, and the proposed full research projects and pilot projects that specifically address the cancer disparities of the Pacific Island Populations. Using its arc of cancer equity, PIPCHE has identified 10 major domains (education/health literacy, policy, environment, lifestyle, culture/community, biology, treatment, healthcare access, psycho-social, and socio-economic status) that influence Pacific Islander cancer health disparities/equity. Each of the research projects, cores, and infrastructure affects one or more of the domains, and therefore knowledge about the action of PIPCHE’s work is value added and helpful, as individuals as a team, while working towards Pacific cancer health equity. PROJECT NARRATIVE: OVERALL The Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE) represents the next step in augmenting a Hawai‘i-Guam-USAPI cancer research infrastructure by investing in Pacific Island Populations leaders, Early Stage Investigators, community partners, and community-informed disparities research. As a result of the 17- year commitment, PIPCHE is also well positioned to increase the diversity of the biomedical cancer science workforce and research leadership that better reflects the Hawai‘i-Guam-USAPI larger racial/ethnic representation and to stimulate new areas of disparities and translational research. PIPCHE has assembled dedicated academic and community partnerships needed to synergistically accelerate disparities research into a sustainable forum that pursues cultural and environmental

"University of California Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (UCaMP) to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities OVERALL University of California Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (UCaMP) to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of UCaMP is to establish and characterize at least 200 patient-derived cancer xenografts (PDXs), and utilize these PDXs in preclinical testing of single agents and drug combinations that help guide future clinical decision-making emphasizing the largest racial/ethnic minority populations residing in California: Hispanic/Latino Americans [HLAs], Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander [AANHPIs], and African American [AAs] compared to Non-Hispanic Whites [NHWs]. We have established an accomplished transdisciplinary research team with an outstanding infrastructure that includes a University of California-wide central IRB system called Reliance and strong preliminary data to support the proposed PDX and cancer disparities research, thus allowing our results to be easily translated to clinical trials. UCaMP is comprised of four University of California NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers: UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UC Davis), UC Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCLA), UC Irvine Health Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UC Irvine), and UC San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCSF). Our collective strengths include complementary expertise in PDX development and drug testing, cancer health disparities, and clinical trial development robustly supported by cores for PDX, Pilot Studies, Bioinformatics, and Administration. We will achieve our goal through two Research Projects. Project 1 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX Models for Gastric and Liver Tumors, specifically addresses cancer health disparities in gastric cancers (GC) and liver cancers (LC) that disproportionately affect all racial/ethnic minorities especially in HLA and AANHPI populations. By understanding the genetic and response differences among HLA, AANHPI compared to NHWs, we could enhance the precision of therapeutic treatments, identify resistance-associated biomarkers, and study resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies.

"Duke Cancer Health Disparities P20 SPORE ABSTRACT – Overall Cancer health disparities span the continuum of cancer care, including prevention, screening, early detection, diagnosis, interception, treatment and survivorship, and are driven by a complex interplay between social, psycho-social, lifestyle, environmental, structural, and biological determinants of health. This Duke Cancer Health Disparities (DCHD) P20 SPORE application evolved from institutional efforts to address this complex, multi-level problem, and represents the work of a group of basic, translational, clinical and population scientists working collaboratively and synergistically to address disparities at particular points in the cancer disparity continuum, while recognizing the complexities of the larger problem of achieving cancer health equity. Our OVERALL GOAL is to develop or improve new or existing interventions and therapies through a better understanding of cancer disparities prevalent in the Duke Cancer Institute’s catchment area. We propose the following Aims: provide the infrastructure, oversight, and resources to conduct innovative translational research to reduce cancer disparities through two projects focused on under-studied disparities (Aim 1); ensure availability of expert support through Administrative and Shared Resource Cores (Aim 2); seed Developmental Research Program (DRP) projects and grow the cancer disparities research community (Aim 3); and complete planning and transition activities in preparation of a P50 SPORE application, including participating in and leading inter- SPORE activities (with other P20s and with P50 SPOREs) that enhance our collective impact (Aim 4). We propose two Projects. Project 1 is entitled “Race-related RNA splicing in non-small cell lung cancer: functional interrogation and therapeutic targeting”. Project 2 is entitled “Racial differences in host immune response and gastric carcinogenesis: translating underlying biology to promote gastric cancer interception”. Our two P20 Projects will be supported by an Administrative Core, a Biospecimen/Pathology Core (Core 1), and a Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (Core 2). DRP projects funded by the P20 may graduate into full projects for the future P50 SPORE. The expected outcomes of these aims are to conduct groundbreaking research in cancer health disparities, to develop novel approaches to mitigate these disparities, and to prepare and submit a full DCHD P50 SPORE application for the continuation and expansion of these efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE – Overall Cancer health disparities are part of a complex, multi-level problem driven by social, psycho-social, lifestyle, environmental, health system, and biological determinants of health.

"NYU Cancer Health Disparity (CHD) SPORE PROJECT SUMMARY Orodigestive tract (ODT) cancers, which account for 32% of cancer deaths in the US, exhibit striking racial disparities in incidence and mortality burdens. Our central hypothesis is that the human microbiome contributes to ODT cancer disparities through biologic interaction of the microbiome with the host in ODT oncogenesis. The overall objective of the NYU Cancer Health Disparity (CHD) SPORE is to develop a comprehensive translational research program to identify, understand and control the microbiota that account for orodigestive track (ODT) cancer disparities. Project 1 will focus on the relationship of the oral microbiome to racial and socioeconomic disparities in the incidence of head and neck cancer, by means of a prospective case-control study nested within 3 large highly diverse US cohorts. Project 2 will focus on the gut microbiome and Black and White racial disparities in tumor recurrence in colon cancer patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. Our research will be strongly supported through shared Cores: (A) Administrative, (B) Biospecimen Procurement & Utilization, and (C) Biostatistics and Bioinformatics. The proposal brings together a highly transdisciplinary team of investigators that work collaboratively through every stage of the proposed research to accomplish the translational goal of this P20 application. The NYU CHD SPORE will provide new knowledge on specific human microbiota that contribute to ODT cancer disparities and will advance our understanding of the functional consequences of these microbiota in ODT oncogenesis. The knowledge gained from the proposed research in the P20 SPORE will transform current clinical practice by identifying high risk groups for ODT cancer in minority populations, that will provide the scientific basis for developing microbially-based personalized prevention, clinical decision tools, and prophylactic interventions to address ODT cancer disparities. Achievement of the P20 SPORE will lay a solid groundwork for a P50 SPORE to translate these evidence-based findings of microbial factors contributing to ODT cancer disparity into actionable practice-based interventions at the clinic and community level.

"Alzheimer's  disease and related dementias in a diverse cohort of Asian Americans PROJECT SUMMARY Over one in four Asian Americans who survive to age 65 can expect to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), yet Asian Americans are under-represented in ADRD research, and heterogeneity in risk across Asian ethnic groups is poorly understood. In the most comprehensive study to date, our research team discovered marked differences in ADRD incidence between Asian American ethnic groups (ADRD incidence was 27% higher in Filipino Americans than Chinese Americans). Despite the major differences in ADRD risk between groups, all Asian ethnic groups had lower ADRD risk than non-Latino whites (25% higher rate in non-Latino whites than Asian Americans). These findings have major public health implications: reducing ADRD rates in all racial/ethnic groups to rates observed in Asian Americans would prevent >190,000 ADRD cases annually in the U.S. Yet it is unknown why Asian Americans have lowered ADRD incidence or why Asian ethnic groups differ. Disentangling these puzzles will inform our understanding of the determinants of ADRD in people of all racial/ethnic backgrounds and help address the major gap in research on drivers of health in Asian Americans, the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the U.S. The overall objective of this application is to examine how social factors, cardiometabolic health, and genetic factors contribute to lower ADRD risk in Asian Americans and differences in risk between Asian ethnic groups (Filipino Americans, Chinese Americans, and Japanese Americans). The rationale for the proposed research is that delineating risk and protective factors for ADRD in Asian Americans will unlock why Asian Americans have lower ADRD risk than other racial/ethnic groups and identify potential strategies to prevent ADRD and reduce ADRD disparities. We have assembled survey data, neighborhood information, and 24 years of medical records on ~12,000 Filipino, Japanese, and Chinese American Kaiser health plan members that will be matched 1:3 to a sample of non-Latino whites. Further, approximately 25% of the sample has genotype data available. This is the largest, most diverse longitudinal sample of Asian Americans with a rich set of biomedical and social data relevant to ADRD available. Our Specific Aims are: 1) evaluate the role of social factors (generational status, educational attainment, income, neighborhood disadvantage metrics, neighborhood ethnic enclaves) on ADRD risk in Asian Americans; 2) evaluate the role of cardiometabolic health (diabetes, hypertension, stroke) on ADRD risk in Asian Americans; 3) determine whether genetic ancestry and APOE genotype influence variation in ADRD incidence observed in Asian Americans. Examining the roles of social, cardiometabolic, and genetic factors on ADRD risk in a large, diverse cohort of Asian Americans and whites will provide valuable information to prevent ADRD in people of all racial/ethnic backgrounds and reduce ADRD disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a major public health problem. Including more racially and socially diverse populations in research provides major opportunities for understanding the determinants of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.

"CBPR: Extending the Use of Innovative Methodologies in the Behavioral & Social Sciences Project Summary/Abstract The need for the use of innovative methodologies in the behavioral and social sciences has been widely noted. Innovative and community-engaged approaches to research and interventions are essential to address social and physical environmental determinants of population health and more specifically racial and ethnic inequities in health, which aligns with NIH's mission of uncovering new knowledge that will lead to better health for all. There is a need to enhance capacity in innovative methods for researchers conducting behavioral and social sciences research (BSSR) particularly in the context of community-engaged approaches. One such approach, community-based participatory research (CBPR), is innovative in and of itself for many researchers conducting BSSR, and there are also numerous specific innovations within the context of a CBPR approach that are particularly relevant to the mission of NIH. These include the integrated use of mixed methods (combining qualitative and quantitative data), innovative research designs that complement randomized controlled designs, methods to advance dissemination and implementation science, and methods for examining the combined influence of physical environmental and socioeconomic factors on behavioral and health outcomes. Further, there are few opportunities for both early-career and established researchers to engage in a co-learning process facilitated by experienced academic-community faculty teams. Finally, there is a need to promote the diversity of the BSSR workforce, including increasing participation of researchers from underrepresented racial, ethnic, and economically and educationally disadvantaged groups. Thus, the overarching goal of the proposed research education program renewal, Community-Based Participatory Research: Extending Capacity to Use Innovative Methodologies in the Behavioral and Social Sciences (the Extend Program), is to enhance knowledge and skills in the use of innovative methodologies in BSSR within the context of CBPR, in partnership with the communities involved, to examine and address health inequities. The Extend Program will be carried out by the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center (Detroit URC), a CBPR partnership established in 1995 which aims to enhance capacity of community and academic entities to conduct and foster CBPR to promote health equity, in conjunction with Community-Campus Partnerships for Health (CCPH), a national non-profit membership organization that promotes health equity through community-academic partnerships. The program includes three components: integrated educational activities for academic-community research teams involving an intensive skill development short course and mentoring and career development activities; ongoing learning and capacity-building using a train-the-trainers model and the continuation of a Community-Academic Scholars Network; and widespread national dissemination activities. Project Narrative Community-Based Participatory Research: Extending Capacity to Use Innovative Methodologies in the Behavioral and Social Sciences (the Extend Program) is an innovative national training program for behavioral and social science researchers, in partnership with the communities involved, to advance scientific research skills in community-based participatory research with significant enrollment of participants from diverse racial, ethnic, and economically and educationally disadvantaged groups.

"(2/2) TUFCCC/HC Regional Comprehensive Cancer Health Disparity Partnership PROJECT SUMMARY Overall TUFCCC: Grace X. Ma, PhD (Contact PI) and Jean-Pierre Issa, MD (MPI)  HC: Olorunseun O. Ogunwobi, MD, PhD (Contact PI) and Joel Erblich, PhD, MPH (MPI) Despite advances in early detection and treatment of cancer, significant racial/ethnic disparities exist in African, Asian-Pacific, and Hispanic Americans, bearing disproportionate cancer burden. These cancer health disparities are particularly salient in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-New York City (PNN) region, where there is a high concentration of minority populations compared to elsewhere in the U.S. Moreover, despite numerous academic institutions conducting biomedical research in PNN region, there is a critical dearth of underrepresented minorities (URMs) involved in cancer research, who bring unique scientific and cultural strengths necessary to conquer cancer health disparities. Building on collaborative history, successful and synergistic planning activities/accomplishments between TUFCCC and HC, and NCI-funded cancer disparities research networks (CNPC), we propose to establish TUFCCC/HC Regional Comprehensive Cancer Health Disparities Partnership to reduce cancer health disparities in PNN region. The goals of this Partnership are to: a) develop a strong and sustainable collaborative cancer health equity research infrastructure, b) support the development of outstanding URM students and ESIs who are committed to careers in cancer research, and c) collaboratively engage the community in enhancing quality and feasibility of these efforts. These goals will be achieved through the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create and enhance sustainable cancer disparity research collaborations in URM populations between TUFCCC and HC. Aim 1a. Enhance institutional cancer research capacity at HC in basic, behavioral and clinical cancer research and provide HC researchers with access to cancer core facilities, resources and expertise at TUFCCC. Aim 1b. Increase the number of research projects at TUFCCC that focus on cancer health disparities in underserved populations throughout the PNN region. Aim 2. Provide research education opportunities in cancer disparities to support a pipeline of diverse and URM undergraduate and graduate students at HC and TUFCCC. Aim 3. Establish a sustainable career development program to increase the number and diversity of investigators/ESIs to conduct cancer and cancer disparity research at both HC and TUFCCC. Aim 4. Use a Community-Based Participatory Research approach to engage researchers, students and community leaders to develop and implement culturally appropriate collaborative cancer outreach, research and education initiatives to increase access to, and utilization of cancer prevention, early detection and treatment in underserved disparity populations. To achieve U54 goals/aims, the Partnership includes two innovative and rigorous full research projects, a pilot project and a series of integrated cores, including Research Education, Planning and Evaluation, Community Outreach, and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics. Administrative Core will provide oversight and cohesion to the Partnership. Finally, the Partnership has a high level of institutional commitments from both TUFCCC and HC and is well positioned to make significant contributions to advancing cancer health equity in PNN region and beyond.

"Multidisciplinary Educational Approach to Reducing Cancer Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Increasing the diversity of cancer researchers and clinicians is a key strategy for finding innovative cancer control solutions and reducing cancer disparities. This Youth Enjoy Science Research Education (YES) Program will increase the diversity of University of California San Diego (UCSD) graduates who are pursuing graduate/professional training in the sciences. This YES Program is grounded on the Transformative Learning Theory and UCSD's 16 years of experience conducting UCSD's successful CURE Program. This YES Program will increase the number of women and underrepresented students from diverse scientific disciplines who are prepared for graduate school admission, with a focus on addressing cancer and cancer disparities. Specifically, YES students participate in classroom and laboratory learning activities that raise their understanding of cancer and the nation's and the world's cancer disparities. Thus, cancer disparities and how they are identified and resolved become the common theme that interconnects this YES Program's various learning activities. Students approach the issues related to cancer disparities, from the perspective of their individual laboratory training, classes and workshops, their own cultural backgrounds, community outreach events they deploy, and their chosen academic and professional pathways. San Diego's three NCI-designated cancer centers (UCSD, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, and Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute) invite the YES students to work and learn in the basic, behavioral, clinical and translational cancer research labs of their top cancer researchers. In their labs and classrooms, the YES students gain a solid understanding of cancer and the many bio-behavioral issues related to the development and exacerbation of cancer disparities and the possible resolutions. With this information and their literature review, students learn how to work on multidisciplinary teams as they develop programs to help reduce their community's cancer morbidity and mortality rates. Through these activities, students learn that, throughout their lives, they can play a role in reducing cancer disparities. To help YES students' reach their full academic, personal, and professional potential, they are also offered supplementary learning experiences, e.g., public speaking, goal setting and time management, writing, conducting literature search and synthesis skills, and experiences presenting and discussing their research work with professional and lay audiences. Students also prepare and submit abstracts to present their research findings at research symposia and national scientific meetings. Mentoring of the YES Program students, continues throughout their time at UCSD and on to graduate school. Thus, the premise of this YES program is that this learning opportunity will give the students hands-on research experiences and skills that will help them to secure admission to graduate level STEM programs and careers in cancer control research, always with a focus on reducing cancer disparities. San Diego’s three NCI-designated Cancer Centers are collaborating in this Youth Enjoy Science Research Education (YES) Program, an intensive, laboratory, classroom, and community-based learning opportunity to help UCSD students from underrepresented communities advance to the graduate levels of education needed to pursue cancer-related health and science careers. Student participants are matched with faculty research mentors who give the students hands-on experiences in cancer-related research and discuss how their lab’s research focus could help address cancer disparities. Students’ classroom and workshops teach students about cancer disparities and give students hands-on experiences creating and delivering interventions to help reduce cancer disparities in their community.",Multidisciplinary Educational Approach to Reducing Cancer Disparities,10002204,R25CA221779,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Awareness ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Dentistry ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Engineering ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Play ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Schedule ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Time Management ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Research Activity ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Review Literature ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Public Speaking ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Event ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' religious group ', ' science education ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' theories ', ' nano tech ', ' nano technology ', ' nano-technological ', ' nanotech ', ' nanotechnological ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' drug discovery ', ' Drops ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' tumor registry ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical care ', ' Secure ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' hands-on learning ', ' faculty research ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' lab experience ', ' lab training ', ' laboratory training ', ' laboratory experience ', ' training opportunity ', ' hands on research ', ' education research ', ' academic readiness ', ' academic preparation ', ' Student recruitment ', ' translational cancer research ', ' recruit ', ' implementation strategy ', ' science, technology, engineering and math program ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics program ', ' STEM program ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R25,2020,469075,0.015652862289621997
"(1/2) Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE) PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL The Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE) is a 17-year collaboration between the University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) that continues to advance cancer health equity, increase the cancer research and education capacity, and decrease significant cancer disparities in Pacific Islands Populations. Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry are a highly underserved and vulnerable minority with a disparate cancer burden, including significant underrepresentation among cancer and biomedical researchers and healthcare providers, which further exacerbates the disparities. The overarching goal and long-term objective are to promote cancer health equity and mitigate the impact of cancer on Pacific Island Populations through increasing cancer research leadership and capacity in Hawai‘i, Guam and the United States Affiliated Pacific Islands, which comprise the Pacific Island Populations addressed by this project. As the only National Cancer Institute-funded Partnership serving the underrepresented Pacific Island region, PIPCHE will accomplish its goals through the following specific aims: (1) Continue to develop a diverse portfolio of Pacific Island Population-focused cancer research projects that include clinical, basic, and population health sciences, (2) Collaborate with local and regional Pacific Island community organizations that work with underrepresented Pacific Island Populations to promote cancer health equity and enhance opportunities for research training and workforce development, (3) Sustain, strengthen, and continuously evaluate of all the Partnership’s research, core activities, and research education programs, (4) Enhance and implement evidence-based, relevant, cancer-related public health interventions and cancer, prevention and control strategies with and within underrepresented communities, and (5) Expand the scientific collaboration among PIPCHE members and other faculty within the two institutions, with an emphasis on recruiting Early Stage Investigators of Pacific Island ancestry. PIPCHE will carry out these aims by continued investment in four Cores (Cancer Outreach, Research Education, Planning and Evaluation, and Administration), which provide the infrastructure and governance of the Partnership. The proposed Shared Resources (Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Information Technology, and Cancer Registry) will provide essential technical and scientific support to the PIPCHE student scholars, trainees, and the proposed full research projects and pilot projects that specifically address the cancer disparities of the Pacific Island Populations. Using its arc of cancer equity, PIPCHE has identified 10 major domains (education/health literacy, policy, environment, lifestyle, culture/community, biology, treatment, healthcare access, psycho-social, and socio-economic status) that influence Pacific Islander cancer health disparities/equity. Each of the research projects, cores, and infrastructure affects one or more of the domains, and therefore knowledge about the action of PIPCHE’s work is value added and helpful, as individuals as a team, while working towards Pacific cancer health equity. PROJECT NARRATIVE: OVERALL The Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE) represents the next step in augmenting a Hawai‘i-Guam-USAPI cancer research infrastructure by investing in Pacific Island Populations leaders, Early Stage Investigators, community partners, and community-informed disparities research. As a result of the 17- year commitment, PIPCHE is also well positioned to increase the diversity of the biomedical cancer science workforce and research leadership that better reflects the Hawai‘i-Guam-USAPI larger racial/ethnic representation and to stimulate new areas of disparities and translational research. PIPCHE has assembled dedicated academic and community partnerships needed to synergistically accelerate disparities research into a sustainable forum that pursues cultural and environmental

"2/2 Southeast Partnership for Improving Research & Training in Cancer Health Disparities The Southeast Partnership for Improving Research & Training in Cancer Health Disparities (SPIRIT- CHD) unites the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC), an institution serving underserved populations and underrepresented students (ISUPS), and the NCI-designated Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) to advance translational research on the biological mechanisms of cancer health disparities focusing on biospecimen-based research and precision medicine. It also seeks to establish a joint cancer research education program focused on biobanking and precision medicine education. LSUHSC serves a region characterized by an underserved African-American population, and rampant cancer health disparities in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. This region has several growing racial/ethnic minority populations. After Hurricane Katrina, the Hispanic population in Louisiana doubled and is now the fastest growing ethnic minority. MCC is located in Tampa, Florida and serves an increasingly wide catchment area characterized by a population diverse in regard to age, race/ethnicity, language and literacy, and is home to an increasing Latino population. Precision medicine research requires: a well-managed, ethnically and racially diverse biospecimen repository; state of the art technology in genomics, epigenomics and ancestry analysis; availability of language, cultural and literacy specific educational tools and resources; and a research education infrastructure that promotes a pipeline of trainees in cancer disparities research. MCC is a national leader and pioneer in these areas, has highly integrated research programs, and seeks to expand the diversity of their biospecimen research endeavors. This partnership is based on two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Plan and execute two collaborative pilot research projects. The first pilot research project focuses on breast cancer genomics, studying biospecimens from Hispanic/Latina patients of mixed genetic ancestry (African, Native American, European) by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and methylation analysis, to study correlations between molecular subtypes, gene expression profiles, clinical outcomes and ancestry. This project will support the career development of racial/ethnic minority early-stage investigators at LSUHSC and MCC. Specific Aim 2: Plan a collaborative three-pronged cancer research education program that includes: 1) a hands-on summer research experience for undergraduate and medical students; 2) delivery of a curriculum to those students focusing on biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities; and 3) expansion of outreach education to our respective communities about biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities. The combination of these collaborative partnership activities is expected to offer mutual benefit to each institution to impact cancer health disparities, inspire the next generation of researchers, and rapidly lead to the submission of competitive grant applications. Importantly, our main collaborative goal is to bring the benefits of cancer research advancements to underserved communities. Narrative - Overall The Southeast Partnership for Improving Research and Training in Cancer Health Disparities (SPIRIT-CHD) is a formal partnership between the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, an institution serving underserved populations and underrepresented students (ISUPS), and the NCI-designated Moffitt Cancer Center. The SPIRIT-CHD will reduce cancer health disparities in underserved and underrepresented populations by conducting precision medicine/Biospecimen-based research in underserved patient populations that are currently not represented in molecular databases. The SPIRIT-CHD will also develop a joint cancer research education program comprised of summer research experiences, development of a precision medicine/biospecimen curriculum, and delivery of

"South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center (SC CaDRe) SUMMARY This five-year U54 proposal is a collaborative, inter-institutional partnership between South Carolina State University (SCSU), an Historically Black University (HBCU), and the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC-HCC), a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. The partnership began in 2011 under the auspices of an NCI P20 CPACHE grant and has grown to produce this U54 South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center (SC CADRE) application. With input from their joint community partner, the Regional Medical Center of Orangeburg Mabry Cancer Center (RMC-MCC), investigators at both institutions collaborated to design the SC CADRE. The overarching goals of the SC CADRE are to increase SCSU's capacity to conduct transdisciplinary cancer research and to further strengthen and extend a longitudinal research education pipeline that will catalyze a new diverse generation of biomedical researchers focused on cancer disparities. The SC CADRE has three major themes. The first focuses on evaluating the relationship between obesity and prostate and breast cancer disparities. The second theme emphasizes evaluation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) as a novel biomarker related to cancer, cancer disparities, and obesity. The third theme highlights the inclusion of a population unique to the US southeastern coastal region, the Sea Island (SI)/Gullah population. Within five years, the SC CADRE aims for: 1) further elucidation of molecular mechanisms contributing to cancer disparities; 2) an enhanced pipeline of diverse cancer researchers; 3) an increased number of NIH research proposals led by SCSU faculty as independent investigators; and 4) greater community engagement in cancer research. Due to the longstanding SCSU /MUSC-HCC academic partnership and each entity's research and educational strengths and community relationships, the SC CADRE is poised to transform cancer health outcomes for South Carolinians. OVERALL PROJECT NARRATIVE The South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center is an inter-institutional partnership between South Carolina State University (SCSU) and the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center.

"The Northwestern University Cancer Health Equity Research SPORE (NU-CHERS) ABSTRACT Centered in Chicago, one of the most diverse yet segregated cities with some of the most striking health disparities in the US, this P20 feasibility and planning proposal to develop the Northwestern University Cancer Health Equity Research SPORE (NU-CHERS) will generate scientific findings and establish sustainable, collaborative, academic and community infrastructure that will serve as the foundation for a comprehensive translational cancer research program focused on gynecologic cancer health disparities. In this proposal, we set our initial translational research focus on endometrial and ovarian cancer disparities as experienced by Black women. This NU-CHERS P20 program leverages outstanding translational research capacity at Northwestern University and its NCI-designated Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center. Research Project 1 investigates racial disparities in endometrial cancer through tumor genomics. Findings will generate critical information that not only deepens our understanding of the biological racial differences in endometrial tumors but can be used as a predictive measure for racial differences in response to treatments. Research Project 2 focuses on racial differences in DNA methylation events in ovarian cancer which may impact response to platinum-based ovarian cancer treatment and explain the striking disparity in survival experienced by Black women. The study will define the methylomes of high-grade serous ovarian cancer in Black and White women as well as develop high-grade serous ovarian cancer-derived patient derived xenografts (PDX) and organoids from which response of these models to platinum will be assessed in vitro and in vivo. Findings will define pathways and genes regulated epigenetically, which could account for disparity in clinical outcomes and may become relevant targets for intervention. To support these projects and build a solid infrastructure for a future funded gynecologic cancer health disparities P50 SPORE, we propose two Cores. The Administrative Core (AC) is the focal point for scientific, fiscal and administrative oversight and integration. The Gynecologic Biospecimen Pathology Core (GBPC) will maintain tissue/blood repositories for current and future NU-CHERS projects, in partnership with the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County to enhance the availability of minority gynecologic biospecimens available to NU-CHERS researchers. In addition, we propose a Developmental Research Program (DRP) to support NU-CHERS infrastructure development goals and pipeline of translational research excellence. The NU-CHERS P20 team is comprised of basic, translational, and clinical investigators with synergistic strengths poised to forge a lasting translational research program focused on understanding and reducing gynecologic cancer disparities.

"1/2 SDSU/UCSD Cancer Center Comprehensive Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) OVERALL ABSTRACT: This application seeks funding to continue to support the SDSU/UCSD Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership. Our vision, consistent with that of the Comprehensive Partnership for the Advancement of Health Equity (CPACHE) program, is to continue to develop outstanding programs in research, research education, and community outreach in order to understand and address causes for cancer health disparities in our catchment areas of San Diego and Imperial counties, a region with a large and growing Hispanic/Latino population. As this population ages, the number of cancer cases is expected to grow. Addressing the existing gaps in research, education, and health care delivery in this ethnic group is a high priority of our Partnership, which leverages th distinct yet complementary strengths and resources of San Diego State University (SDSU), an officially designated Hispanic Serving Institution, and the University of California (UCSD) Moores Cancer Center (MCC), an NCI-designated Cancer Center. The goal of our Partnership is to reduce the burden of cancer among Hispanic/Latino communities in our catchment area. We accomplish this by building research and research education capacity and by continuing to improve outreach and education to underserved communities in our area, with a special emphasis on Hispanic/Latinos. The PIs represent an outstanding multidisciplinary team of experienced researchers and academic leaders in their own areas. Consistent with the overall goals of the CPACHE program and taking advantage of unique and complementary resources at SDSU and UCSD, we have established an outstanding scientific and leadership team. The complement of two population scientists (Drs. E. Martinez and E. Arredondo), a physician scientist (Dr. S. Crowe), and a basic scientist (Dr. M. Sussman) makes for an outstanding synergistic scientific team. The application includes two Full and one Pilot Project which were selected for their strong hypothesis-driven research aimed at enhancing research capacity at SDSU and increasing cancer disparities research at UCSD. This is complemented by a new Research Education program aimed at providing research experience in cancer and cancer disparities to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups who will be largely Hispanic/Latino. Finally, the Outreach Core involves a unique triad partnership that includes the MCC, SDSU, and federally qualified community health centers that serve the majority of uninsured and Medicaid insured Hispanic/Latinos in a large metropolitan area and along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Partnership has strong institutional commitment, a comprehensive planning and evaluation plan, and the guidance of an outstanding Internal Advisory Board and a stellar Program Steering Committee. There is sound rationale for the continuation of our Partnership as it has and will continue to provide unique, significant, and impactful programs in cancer research, research education, and community outreach. Taken together, the new PI leadership has developed a strong renewal application that meets all the goals of the NCI U54 PACHE program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the application is to seek funding to continue to support the SDSU/UCSD Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership in order to continue to develop outstanding programs in research, research education, and community outreach to understand causes for cancer health disparities and to reduce the burden of cancer among Hispanic/Latino communities in our catchment areas of San Diego and Imperial counties.

"(1/2) Ponce Health Sciences University-Moffitt Cancer Center Partnership The Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU) and the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) have forged a strong working relationship founded on seamless communication with mutual support and benefits. With Partnership resources and significant commitment from both institutions, we have established joint programs enhancing basic and clinical research, enriching cancer outreach, expanding cancer education, and creating a unique Hispanic/Latino (H/L) Biobank, leading to the development of a robust network and infrastructure necessary for a sustained long-term collaboration to improve cancer outcomes in the H/L population. The U54 Partnership's immediate impact includes the identification of new mutations in breast and lung cancer in H/L patients, recruitment of new faculty essential for sustainability and growth, and 84 community outreach educational activities for H/Ls in Florida (FL) and Puerto Rico (PR). The development of the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB) and the training of clinical researchers, with 25 clinical intervention trials activated in Ponce, demonstrate the broad impact realized through the Partnership. Furthermore the Partnership had a critical role in the ACGME re-accreditation of the Hematology/Oncology Fellowship in PR, in the establishment of two stem cell transplant programs in PR by fellows trained in the MCC Bone Marrow Transplant unit, and in the establishment of an ACGME-accredited surgical residency in Ponce with surgical oncology rotations at MCC. The short-term metrics of the first 4 years of the U54 Partnership grant include 48 student participants, 35 peer-reviewed manuscripts published, and 29 grants funded out of a total of 64 submitted.  Our vision for the U54 PACHE renewal is to further grow and engage faculty and students in cancer precision medicine research that directly impacts the H/L populations in FL and PR. The Partnership has the requisite components to fully execute precision medicine in an underserved population—a biobank, quantitative science core (QSC) to analyze data, culturally sensitive outreach materials, expertise in the latest technologies, and a robust research portfolio. The four specific aims for the U54 Partnership renewal are the following. Aim 1: To increase the number of researchers at PHSU focused on basic/translational research in cancer and to augment the number of researchers in cancer health disparities at MCC. This is facilitated with joint projects in ovarian and breast cancer. Aim 2: To further develop outreach programs and research efforts in the H/L communities at both PHSU and MCC. An epidemiological project will examine the impact of receipt of MC1R genotypes on personal sun protection behaviors. Aim 3: To increase support for basic, translational and clinical research in the H/L population by establishing the QSC and further developing the PRBB. The MCC Total Cancer Care protocol will be developed in Ponce hospitals and leveraged by the PRBB to facilitate tissue collection. Aim 4: To provide comprehensive and structured student research education at both PHSU and MCC to facilitate the expansion and success of cancer researchers and clinicians in the H/L population. Over the last 10 years, the Ponce Health Sciences University in Puerto Rico and the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida have developed an exceptionally strong working relationship facilitated by the U56 Partnership Planning and U54 PACHE Comprehensive Partnership awards. The joint programs have resulted in successful outcomes in basic, translational, population and clinical research, as well as in cancer outreach, cancer education and training, and in biobanking.

"2/2 The University of Massachusetts, Boston - Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center U54 Comprehensive Partnership for Cancer Disparities Research The University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) initiated their Partnership in August 2002. The early years of the Partnership during the U56 funding period (2005-2010) established the foundational support and scientific leadership needed to build a solid and vibrant research collaboration. Moving forward, the U54 mechanism drew on this foundation resulting in a robust set of activities in research, capacity building and outreach. Two key tenets guide this sustained partnership between UMass Boston and DF/HCC: a) A common and intense interest in addressing the problem of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality; and b) A belief that through the Partnership, each institution will achieve benefits that neither could achieve on its own. This application for renewal provides extensive evidence of the ways these tenets have been operationalized, the resulting benefits for both institutions and the ways in which this Partnership is now poised to make, at an elevated level, significant advances to the science of cancer control. We are proposing activities that draw on the latest science to understand and address cancer disparities through a transdisciplinary approach that embodies our Partnership theme of “Cells to Society. In support of our new cohesive theme, we have proposed three sophisticated, highly competitive research projects across several areas of basic biomedical and population sciences that will employ evidence and methods to converge upon and impact cancer and cancer health disparities at multiple levels of analysis. To elucidate new areas of research opportunity, the Partnership is excited to explore the intersection between biology-based sciences and social/behavioral sciences. The immediate priorities Summary: ” of the Partnership are: 1) Continuing capacity building for biomedical and cancer research at UMass Boston and cancer disparities research at DF/HCC; 2) Enhancing and scaling up research experiences for students with a specific focus on underrepresented minorities (URMs), across the entire educational pipeline –from undergraduate to postdoctoral levels (see Research Education Core); 3) Continuing close mentoring of early stage investigators with a focus on research and career development; 4) Building a strong and robust Outreach Core that draws on the state of the science from dissemination and implementation sciences (D&I) for building partnerships, translating knowledge and monitoring the results of the translation efforts to build and sustain capacity among community-based organizations (see Outreach Core); 5) Offering infrastructural support to U54 investigators through two service cores, including the Research Design and Analysis, and Genomics Cores (see Shared Resource Core); and 6) Ensuring sustainability for projects, Cores and research education programs via dedicated planning and execution of grant matching with NIH-mechanisms, foundation support and/or institutional support.

"(2/2) TUFCCC/HC Regional Comprehensive Cancer Health Disparity Partnership PROJECT SUMMARY Overall TUFCCC: Grace X. Ma, PhD (Contact PI) and Jean-Pierre Issa, MD (MPI)  HC: Olorunseun O. Ogunwobi, MD, PhD (Contact PI) and Joel Erblich, PhD, MPH (MPI) Despite advances in early detection and treatment of cancer, significant racial/ethnic disparities exist in African, Asian-Pacific, and Hispanic Americans, bearing disproportionate cancer burden. These cancer health disparities are particularly salient in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-New York City (PNN) region, where there is a high concentration of minority populations compared to elsewhere in the U.S. Moreover, despite numerous academic institutions conducting biomedical research in PNN region, there is a critical dearth of underrepresented minorities (URMs) involved in cancer research, who bring unique scientific and cultural strengths necessary to conquer cancer health disparities. Building on collaborative history, successful and synergistic planning activities/accomplishments between TUFCCC and HC, and NCI-funded cancer disparities research networks (CNPC), we propose to establish TUFCCC/HC Regional Comprehensive Cancer Health Disparities Partnership to reduce cancer health disparities in PNN region. The goals of this Partnership are to: a) develop a strong and sustainable collaborative cancer health equity research infrastructure, b) support the development of outstanding URM students and ESIs who are committed to careers in cancer research, and c) collaboratively engage the community in enhancing quality and feasibility of these efforts. These goals will be achieved through the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create and enhance sustainable cancer disparity research collaborations in URM populations between TUFCCC and HC. Aim 1a. Enhance institutional cancer research capacity at HC in basic, behavioral and clinical cancer research and provide HC researchers with access to cancer core facilities, resources and expertise at TUFCCC. Aim 1b. Increase the number of research projects at TUFCCC that focus on cancer health disparities in underserved populations throughout the PNN region. Aim 2. Provide research education opportunities in cancer disparities to support a pipeline of diverse and URM undergraduate and graduate students at HC and TUFCCC. Aim 3. Establish a sustainable career development program to increase the number and diversity of investigators/ESIs to conduct cancer and cancer disparity research at both HC and TUFCCC. Aim 4. Use a Community-Based Participatory Research approach to engage researchers, students and community leaders to develop and implement culturally appropriate collaborative cancer outreach, research and education initiatives to increase access to, and utilization of cancer prevention, early detection and treatment in underserved disparity populations. To achieve U54 goals/aims, the Partnership includes two innovative and rigorous full research projects, a pilot project and a series of integrated cores, including Research Education, Planning and Evaluation, Community Outreach, and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics. Administrative Core will provide oversight and cohesion to the Partnership. Finally, the Partnership has a high level of institutional commitments from both TUFCCC and HC and is well positioned to make significant contributions to advancing cancer health equity in PNN region and beyond.

"Washington University Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Component Background and vision. As an Advanced Center, the vision of the Washington University Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control (WU-ISCCC) is to conduct implementation research to help eliminate cancer disparities in rural and other disadvantaged communities. Goal. The overall goal of the WU-ISCCC is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for rapid-cycle implementation research to increase the reach, external validity, and sustainability of effective cancer control interventions. Our goal and Center activities capture three distinct features: (1) a focus on elimination of cancer disparities; (2) the need for rapid-cycle studies; and (3) the use of systems science approaches to enhance methods and outcomes in implementation science. Setting. Our Center will be housed in an exceptional environment that fosters transdisciplinary collaboration, catalyzes new ideas, and ensures support for research that finds solutions for complex implementation challenges in real-world settings with high cancer disparities (rural and urban counties in Missouri and Illinois). Substantial matching contributions from Washington University will allow us to strategically invest in new ideas. Aims. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) advance the field of implementation science in cancer control by conducting innovative and impactful research; (2) expand an exceptional, diverse team of implementation science investigators and stakeholders; (3) organize and integrate Center components to facilitate transdisciplinary team science; (4) develop an Implementation Laboratory (known as the “Innovation Incubator”) to serve as a conduit for innovative, rapid-cycle, and impactful research; and (5) address cancer disparities by making it as easy as possible for disadvantaged populations to encounter, use, and benefit from evidence-based interventions. Innovations and impact. The WU-ISCCC will be innovative and provide a significant return on the scientific investment.
