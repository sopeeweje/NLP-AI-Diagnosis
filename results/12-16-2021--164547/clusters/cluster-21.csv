"CENTER FOR URBAN AFRICAN AMERICAN AGING RESEARCH This is an application to establish the state of Michigan Center for             Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) at the University                of Michigan and Wayne State University. The overall objective of                 this proposed resource Center is to foster high quality scholarly                and empirical training, research, and interventions focused upon                 health promotion and health among older racial and ethnic minority               populations. This application builds upon the work and expertise of              faculty and students in these two state institutions to empirically              investigate African American health inequalities over the life-                  course. We have been fortunate in developing a knowledgeable group               of research personnel and attracting to each university a large                  number of multi-ethnic faculty and graduate students with interests              in the study of aging and human development in black and other                   minority populations. We propose to establish the MCUAAAR as an                  administrative, training, and scientific research organization among             the University of Michigan's Program for Research on Black Americans             (PRBA) and Life-Course Development (LCD) at the Institute for Social             Research, School of Nursing, the Institute of Gerontology, School                of Nursing and Urban Studies Center at Wayne State University, and               community based organizations (CBO) in the greater Detroit                       Metropolitan area. This proposed minority resource center builds on              other cooperative research and administrative arrangements between               UM, WSU and community based organizations. The proposed resource                 center will contain four interacting components: 1) the                          Administrative Core will provide administrative support, facilitate              intellectual interchange, and provide overall coordination within                the proposed Center and with other university units and community                health service sites; 2) the Community Liaison Core will strengthen              existing community research and service relationships as well as                 provide sources of cooperating community respondents for the                     proposed pilot research and intervention efforts; 3) the                         Investigator Development Core will identify, select, and mentor                  multi-disciplinary and multicultural investigators interested in                 research and interventions on the health of minority elders; and,                4) the Measurement Core will serve as a training and research focal              point and assume leadership in refining and honing the research                  interests of all the investigators, but especially young                         investigators conducting the pilot studies. Finally, we propose a                set of Coordinating Center activities designed to provide                        intellectual and administrative ties among the selected national                 group of Minority Resource Centers. Thus, the proposed MCUAAAR will              provide a comprehensive mix of established and new pilot                         methodologies, a broad scope of proposed culturally sensitive                    research and intervention activities, and a multidisciplinary and                multi-ethnic team of established researchers and appropriately                   mentored early investigators.

Jackson and Peter Lichenberg      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this request for support of the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) is for continued resources to promote health research on minority elders, particularly African American elders, that will lead to health promotion and the reduction and elimination of health disparities as called for in Healthy People 2010 through several approaches consistent with the NIA's 2000-2005 Strategic Plan.  Examples of MCUAAAR's efforts include continued development of its successful mentoring program focused on building a network of minority investigators who are committed to becoming productive scholars in the area of health and aging.  Health promotion and the reduction and elimination of health disparities is only possible with the effective recruitment and retention of African American and other minority elders in health research.  We will continue to build upon our productive research program in this area and continue to reach out to seniors in the city of Detroit with the explicit purpose of building upon our developed databases of individuals who have agreed to be contacted for health research purposes.  We have demonstrated our ability to form productive, collaborative relationships over the prior five-year period and will continue and extend our collaborations in this grant period with NIA Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers, NIA Claude Pepper Centers for Independence, the Population Studies Center and the NACDA at the Institute for Social Research.  During the last five year period we have joined with a wide set of relevant NIA Centers, university, and community organizations at our two main institutions and in the region, as well as at select institutions around the country.  Building on the strengths at the University of Michigan (UM) and Wayne State University (WSU), our specific set of related loci will be research on health and health promotion with a special emphasis on our relative research strengths in cognitive functioning and dysfunction, cognitive appraisal, and perception as they relate to a wide range of health outcomes and disorders, the promotion of independence, and the understanding of how demographic and social changes relate to health disparities and their elimination among older African Americans and other minority populations.         ",Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging,6574670,P30AG015281,"['aging ', ' biomedical facility ', ' African American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2002,818344,0.11205824310125645

"Archiving the Charleston Heart Study  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Archiving the Charleston Heart Study (CHS) data collected over a 41-year period (1960-2000) will facilitate important research efforts directed toward understanding the natural progression of aging in a community based cohort. Enhancement of current scientific knowledge related to the socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics of an aging biracial community cohort may be possible through secondary data analyses of this unique data set. The CHS began enrolling a random selection of community residents in 1960 who were then 35 years of age and older - including men and women, black and white. The primary hypothesis of the original study was to investigate racial differences in the manifestation and risk factors for coronary disease. Over the ensuing 40+ years, a variety of outcome measurements were incorporated into the reexamination of the participants, including psychosocial, behavioral, aging and functional measures. The aims of this application are to document and preserve the Charleston Heart Study for future research efforts, to update the vital status of the cohort, and to establish mechanisms for distributing the data and documentation to researchers in a manner that will facilitate its use, and provide user support and technical services. Archiving this longitudinal data for its future scientific use will ensure the necessary foundation for subsequent studies to expand scientific knowledge of the risk factors, correlates and consequences of aging, while simultaneously allowing for exploration of racial disparity in the manifestation of putative risk factors and outcomes.

"Health disparities and aging in societies in transition    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Social disparities in health are a major unsolved public health problem; they affect many health outcomes throughout the lifespan, including the elderly. Our understanding of social disparities of health in aging populations can be enhanced by complementing studies in western countries by studies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the former Soviet Union (FSU), taking advantage of the unique set of social and health conditions in the region after the fall of communism. Mortality and morbidity from CVD and other chronic diseases at middle and older ages are much higher in CEE/FSU than in the West, and available data suggest that this is also true for other outcomes pertinent to older ages, such as disability, decline in physical functioning and cognitive impairment. Extending research on social disparities in the health of aging populations into CEE/FSU will break confounding due to inter-correlation between socioeconomic factors present in western data (as associations between socioeconomic indicators are weak in CEE/FSU); the questions of endogeneity can be addressed, using the dramatic temporal changes in social conditions and health status that have taken place in CEE/FSU during the societal transformation; and comparisons with western studies, such as the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), will be conducted. The objective of the application is to build on an existing study of CVD in CEE/FSU and to establish a longitudinal study of aging with repeated measurements of health, functioning, social position, economics and psychosocial factors. The specific aims of the proposed study are: (1) to investigate disparities in CVD and aging related health outcomes between countries and their relation with macro-economic factors; (2) to study social disparities within countries in order to identify the dimension(s) of socioeconomic position that are most important for health; (3) to examine behavioral, psychosocial and biological mechanisms linking socioeconomic position and health; and (4) to investigate whether poor health is associated with decline in socioeconomic status in aging populations (endogeneity). The existing study is based in Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic, and consists of a baseline survey and mortality follow up. Baseline data on socioeconomic and psychosocial factors, nutrition, alcohol and biological samples are being collected on random samples of men and women 45-69 years old. It is proposed to conduct a new wave of data collection (Wave II) and to add Lithuania (as an example of a Baltic country). As far as possible, the study instruments will be identical to those used in HRS and ELSA, focusing on functioning and disability, cognition, quality of life, socioeconomic position, economics, and psychosocial factors. The expected total size of the new study is 28,000 subjects. Analyses will examine cross-sectional outcomes, changes in health and functioning between the baseline and Wave II, and incidence of CVD and mortality since the baseline.         ",Health disparities and aging in societies in transition,6754917,R01AG023522,"['human middle age (35-64) ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aging ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' Europe ', ' Poland ', ' Commonwealth of Independent States ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' human mortality ', ' health survey ', ' psychological test ', ' social psychology ', ' socioeconomics ', ' social class ', ' culture ', ' functional ability ', ' quality of life ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' psychological aspect of aging ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,R01,2004,454136,0.07504483470139021

"Positive Emotions and Exceptional Healthy Aging  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study addresses the NIA pilot research grant program PAR-03-056-#12-calling for preliminary studies examining ""factors moderating the rate of age-related changes and risk for adverse events with increasing age."" The program announcement is particularly interested in ""factors contributing to exceptional healthy aging in humans."" We propose: to examine ""exceptional healthy aging' through an examination of the trajectory of the syndrome of frailty in a sample of older, initially non-frail, Mexican Americans; and to examine whether positive affect is associated with the delay in onset and progression of frailty for this population. This work is important for 3 reasons. First, the syndrome of frailty has not been studied in older Mexican American populations. Second, this work begins to examine factors that may contribute to a narrowing of health disparities that currently exist between underserved minority groups. Third, the committee on future directions for Behavioral Social Sciences Research at the National Institutes of Health recently recommended that new resources be made available for advancing knowledge on aspects of positive health including mechanisms underlying the health benefits resulting from positive psychological influences.

The overall objective of this proposed resource center is to foster high quality scholarly and empirical training, research, and interventions focused upon health promotion and health among older racial and ethnic minority populations.  This application builds upon the work and expertise of faculty and students in these two state institutions to empirically investigate African American health inequalities over the life-course.  We have been fortunate in developing a knowledgeable group of research personnel and attracting to each university a large number of multi-ethnic faculty and graduate students with interests in the study of aging and human development in black and other minority populations.  We propose to continue the MCUAAAR as an administrative, training, and scientific research organization among the University of Michigan's Program for Research on Black Americans (PRBA) and Life-Course Development (LCD) at the Institute for Social Research, School of Nursing, School of Public Health, the Institute of Gerontology, School of Nursing and Urban Studies Center at Wayne State University, and community based organizations (CBO) in the greater Detroit Metropolitan area.  This proposed minority aging resource center builds on other cooperative research and administrative arrangements between UM, WSU and community based organizations.

"Health disparities and aging in societies in transition    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Social disparities in health are a major unsolved public health problem; they affect many health outcomes throughout the lifespan, including the elderly. Our understanding of social disparities of health in aging populations can be enhanced by complementing studies in western countries by studies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the former Soviet Union (FSU), taking advantage of the unique set of social and health conditions in the region after the fall of communism. Mortality and morbidity from CVD and other chronic diseases at middle and older ages are much higher in CEE/FSU than in the West, and available data suggest that this is also true for other outcomes pertinent to older ages, such as disability, decline in physical functioning and cognitive impairment. Extending research on social disparities in the health of aging populations into CEE/FSU will break confounding due to inter-correlation between socioeconomic factors present in western data (as associations between socioeconomic indicators are weak in CEE/FSU); the questions of endogeneity can be addressed, using the dramatic temporal changes in social conditions and health status that have taken place in CEE/FSU during the societal transformation; and comparisons with western studies, such as the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), will be conducted. The objective of the application is to build on an existing study of CVD in CEE/FSU and to establish a longitudinal study of aging with repeated measurements of health, functioning, social position, economics and psychosocial factors. The specific aims of the proposed study are: (1) to investigate disparities in CVD and aging related health outcomes between countries and their relation with macro-economic factors; (2) to study social disparities within countries in order to identify the dimension(s) of socioeconomic position that are most important for health; (3) to examine behavioral, psychosocial and biological mechanisms linking socioeconomic position and health; and (4) to investigate whether poor health is associated with decline in socioeconomic status in aging populations (endogeneity). The existing study is based in Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic, and consists of a baseline survey and mortality follow up. Baseline data on socioeconomic and psychosocial factors, nutrition, alcohol and biological samples are being collected on random samples of men and women 45-69 years old. It is proposed to conduct a new wave of data collection (Wave II) and to add Lithuania (as an example of a Baltic country). As far as possible, the study instruments will be identical to those used in HRS and ELSA, focusing on functioning and disability, cognition, quality of life, socioeconomic position, economics, and psychosocial factors. The expected total size of the new study is 28,000 subjects. Analyses will examine cross-sectional outcomes, changes in health and functioning between the baseline and Wave II, and incidence of CVD and mortality since the baseline.         ",Health disparities and aging in societies in transition,6933150,R01AG023522,"['human middle age (35-64) ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aging ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' Europe ', ' Poland ', ' Commonwealth of Independent States ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' human mortality ', ' health survey ', ' psychological test ', ' social psychology ', ' socioeconomics ', ' social class ', ' culture ', ' functional ability ', ' quality of life ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' psychological aspect of aging ', ' health disparity ', ' Czech Republic ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,R01,2005,449136,0.07504483470139021

Jackson and Peter Lichenberg      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this request for support of the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) is for continued resources to promote health research on minority elders, particularly African American elders, that will lead to health promotion and the reduction and elimination of health disparities as called for in Healthy People 2010 through several approaches consistent with the NIA's 2000-2005 Strategic Plan.  Examples of MCUAAAR's efforts include continued development of its successful mentoring program focused on building a network of minority investigators who are committed to becoming productive scholars in the area of health and aging.  Health promotion and the reduction and elimination of health disparities is only possible with the effective recruitment and retention of African American and other minority elders in health research.  We will continue to build upon our productive research program in this area and continue to reach out to seniors in the city of Detroit with the explicit purpose of building upon our developed databases of individuals who have agreed to be contacted for health research purposes.  We have demonstrated our ability to form productive, collaborative relationships over the prior five-year period and will continue and extend our collaborations in this grant period with NIA Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers, NIA Claude Pepper Centers for Independence, the Population Studies Center and the NACDA at the Institute for Social Research.  During the last five year period we have joined with a wide set of relevant NIA Centers, university, and community organizations at our two main institutions and in the region, as well as at select institutions around the country.  Building on the strengths at the University of Michigan (UM) and Wayne State University (WSU), our specific set of related loci will be research on health and health promotion with a special emphasis on our relative research strengths in cognitive functioning and dysfunction, cognitive appraisal, and perception as they relate to a wide range of health outcomes and disorders, the promotion of independence, and the understanding of how demographic and social changes relate to health disparities and their elimination among older African Americans and other minority populations.         ",Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging,7120021,P30AG015281,"['aging ', ' biomedical facility ', ' African American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2006,1291263,0.11205824310125645
"Health disparities and agingin societies in transition    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Social disparities in health are a major unsolved public health problem; they affect many health outcomes throughout the lifespan, including the elderly. Our understanding of social disparities of health in aging populations can be enhanced by complementing studies in western countries by studies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the former Soviet Union (FSU), taking advantage of the unique set of social and health conditions in the region after the fall of communism. Mortality and morbidity from CVD and other chronic diseases at middle and older ages are much higher in CEE/FSU than in the West, and available data suggest that this is also true for other outcomes pertinent to older ages, such as disability, decline in physical functioning and cognitive impairment. Extending research on social disparities in the health of aging populations into CEE/FSU will break confounding due to inter-correlation between socioeconomic factors present in western data (as associations between socioeconomic indicators are weak in CEE/FSU); the questions of endogeneity can be addressed, using the dramatic temporal changes in social conditions and health status that have taken place in CEE/FSU during the societal transformation; and comparisons with western studies, such as the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), will be conducted. The objective of the application is to build on an existing study of CVD in CEE/FSU and to establish a longitudinal study of aging with repeated measurements of health, functioning, social position, economics and psychosocial factors. The specific aims of the proposed study are: (1) to investigate disparities in CVD and aging related health outcomes between countries and their relation with macro-economic factors; (2) to study social disparities within countries in order to identify the dimension(s) of socioeconomic position that are most important for health; (3) to examine behavioral, psychosocial and biological mechanisms linking socioeconomic position and health; and (4) to investigate whether poor health is associated with decline in socioeconomic status in aging populations (endogeneity). The existing study is based in Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic, and consists of a baseline survey and mortality follow up. Baseline data on socioeconomic and psychosocial factors, nutrition, alcohol and biological samples are being collected on random samples of men and women 45-69 years old. It is proposed to conduct a new wave of data collection (Wave II) and to add Lithuania (as an example of a Baltic country). As far as possible, the study instruments will be identical to those used in HRS and ELSA, focusing on functioning and disability, cognition, quality of life, socioeconomic position, economics, and psychosocial factors. The expected total size of the new study is 28,000 subjects. Analyses will examine cross-sectional outcomes, changes in health and functioning between the baseline and Wave II, and incidence of CVD and mortality since the baseline.         ",Health disparities and agingin societies in transition,7090625,R01AG023522,"['human middle age (35-64) ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aging ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' Europe ', ' Poland ', ' Commonwealth of Independent States ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' human mortality ', ' health survey ', ' psychological test ', ' social psychology ', ' socioeconomics ', ' social class ', ' culture ', ' functional ability ', ' quality of life ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' psychological aspect of aging ', ' health disparity ', ' Czech Republic ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,R01,2006,441063,0.05745890341733285
"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application to continue the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) at the University of Michigan and Wayne State University. Conceptually, the research and training activities of the proposed center build upon a social and behavioral science model of health promotion and health behaviors that emphasize the intersection of structural statuses (especially socio- economic), gender, and race/ethnicity in influencing health outcomes. It is life-course oriented and assumes that statuses and conditions in older ages among ethnic and racial minorities begin at earlier periods of the life-course and are amenable to culturally sensitive and appropriate interventions. The model grows out of our research on productive roles among the elderly and focuses attention on elements of effective aging that are culturally relevant and efficacious in influencing positive health and functioning outcomes. The proposed MCUAAAR would be organized into three cores. The Administrative Core will provide administrative support, facilitate intellectual interchange, and provide overall coordination within the proposed Center, and with other university units and community based organizations. The Community Liaison Core will work with existing, and build new, community research and service relationships, provide sources of cooperating community respondents for the proposed pilot research and intervention efforts, and develop a new public policy outreach initiative. The Investigator Development Core will identify, select, and mentor multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural investigators interested in research and interventions on the health of minority elders. Although a separate measurement core is not proposed, investigators skilled in measurement and methodology will work within the Administrative Core to refine and hone the research interests of all the investigators, but especially young scholars conducting the pilot studies. This application builds upon the work and expertise of faculty and students in these two state institutions to empirically investigate African American health inequalities over the life-course. We have been fortunate in developing a knowledgeable group of research personnel and attracting to each university a large number of multi-ethnic core and affiliated faculty, many of them former MCUAAAR Scholars, and graduate students with interests in the study of aging and human development in black and other minority populations. The MCUAAAR will continue to support a multi- disciplinary and multi-ethnic team of established researchers and appropriately mentored early investigators. We are committed to building and maintaining research infra-structures for mentoring new minority researchers, enhancing the diversity of future social and behavioral science aging researchers, and improving current, and developing new, strategies for recruiting and retaining older minority participants in health related research among the growing diverse elderly populations.           ",Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging,7339728,P30AG015281,[''],NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2007,717448,0.1385110248884583

"Center for Demography of Health and Aging This is a proposal for continuing support of the Center for Demography of Health and Aging at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which was created in 1999 with a five-year P30 grant from NIA. The overall goal of the Center for Demography of Health and Aging remains to build a major research and training program in the demography of health and aging. The institutional architecture of CDHA is designed to create links between social demography and biomedical and epidemiological research on health and aging. Major themes of ongoing and developmental research activities within CDHA include (a) midlife development and aging; (b) economics of population aging; (c) inequalities in health and aging; (d) international, comparative studies of population aging; and (e) linking social-demographic and biomedical research in population aging. During its first five years, CDHA has grown from 39 to 54 faculty members; has successfully turned pilot projects into grants; has grown from about $3.3 million to $55 million in NIA support; has created unique data resources and a secure data enclave; and has substantially expanded training activities. CDHA coexists with the Center for Demography and Ecology and thus shares and extends a well-developed research infrastructure in administration, computing, print library, data library, and GIS facilities. CDHA's administrative core (A) will provide leadership and administrative support for the Center. The program development core (B) will support faculty, staff, and research assistants engaged in innovative pilot research projects that are likely to lead to major NIA support. The external innovative network core (C) will continue a popular, networked current awareness service for research in the demography of aging and support regular workshops, conferences, and visits. The external research resources core (D) will support user-friendly _rovision of large-scale public data resources in the demography of health and aging.

"Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) was established at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in 1997. CADC was one of the six original Centers funded by the Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) program by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute on Nursing Research and the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities. Over the first 5 years (1997-2002), CADC expanded the strong research foundation for scholarship on health disparities at UCSF. CADC was renewed for a 2nd five-year period (2002-2007) under the RCMAR program and was 1 of 4 Centers that have been successfully funded for both cycles. Over these 9 years, health disparities research has achieved a level of priority at the institution that is unparalleled. The coinciding of national trends, demographic changes and human resources at UCSF contributed to this transformation. CADC has been in part responsible for this evolution and has become the focal point for minority aging research and also for training a cadre of diverse multidisciplinary investigators who will define the health disparities research agenda for years to come. The Overall Specific Aims of the entire application reflect overall goals of the Cores as follows: 1. Sustain and expand the organizational structure and expertise of the CADC at UCSF to foster the development of minority investigators by funding pilot projects and establishing mentoring relationships so these investigators will complete the projects and publish their research. 2.

"Ethnic Trajectories of Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging research has been increasingly focused on examining the intersections between aging and putative social factors involved in determining physical and mental health status. Much of the research is based on cross-sectional data. Furthermore, existing longitudinal analyses are mostly concerned with transitions between two points in time. This proposed research analyzes trajectories of health and health care, consisting of multiple transitions amongwhite, black and Latino older Americans. It has three specific aims. First, we are interested in how health status changes in old age for whites, blacks and Latinos. Second, this proposal will explore the changes in the use of medical care at older ages by ethnic group, specifically for blacks, whites and Latinos in the U.S. will be examined via these analyses. Third, this research will assess the extent to which changes in health status interface with those in health care utilization. Using population based samples representing different ethnic groups, we hope to cross-validate prior observations and to further explore the heterogeneity underlying the age norms of health care utilization and health status. To evaluate the research questions posed, hierarchical linear models will be used. In particular, ethnic differences in changes in health trajectories (health status as well as service utilization) within an older person will be represented by growth curves. The data used for these proposed analyses will come from an ongoing nationally representative public use longitudinal survey, the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) collected at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the trends of disability and decline in old age is of critical importance to health policymakers. In particular, identifying the challenges posed by an aging population with worse health outcomes for some groups relative to others is a necessary social planning instrument. This research proposes to examine the health and health care trends of older white, black and Latino Americans to determine whether such differential patterns in aging are at play.             ",Ethnic Trajectories of Aging,7487689,F31AG029783,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Glean ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Family ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aging ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Medical ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Institutes ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linear Models ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Sample Size ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Michigan ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Play ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Retirement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Planning ', ' Health Transition ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Sampling ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Health financing ', ' comparative ', ' stem ', ' service utilization ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2008,31704,0.05018232600713807

"Health disparities and aging in societies in transition    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Social disparities in health are a major unsolved public health problem; they affect many health outcomes throughout the lifespan, including the elderly. Our understanding of social disparities of health in aging populations can be enhanced by complementing studies in western countries by studies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the former Soviet Union (FSU), taking advantage of the unique set of social and health conditions in the region after the fall of communism. Mortality and morbidity from CVD and other chronic diseases at middle and older ages are much higher in CEE/FSU than in the West, and available data suggest that this is also true for other outcomes pertinent to older ages, such as disability, decline in physical functioning and cognitive impairment. Extending research on social disparities in the health of aging populations into CEE/FSU will break confounding due to inter-correlation between socioeconomic factors present in western data (as associations between socioeconomic indicators are weak in CEE/FSU); the questions of endogeneity can be addressed, using the dramatic temporal changes in social conditions and health status that have taken place in CEE/FSU during the societal transformation; and comparisons with western studies, such as the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), will be conducted. The objective of the application is to build on an existing study of CVD in CEE/FSU and to establish a longitudinal study of aging with repeated measurements of health, functioning, social position, economics and psychosocial factors. The specific aims of the proposed study are: (1) to investigate disparities in CVD and aging related health outcomes between countries and their relation with macro-economic factors; (2) to study social disparities within countries in order to identify the dimension(s) of socioeconomic position that are most important for health; (3) to examine behavioral, psychosocial and biological mechanisms linking socioeconomic position and health; and (4) to investigate whether poor health is associated with decline in socioeconomic status in aging populations (endogeneity). The existing study is based in Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic, and consists of a baseline survey and mortality follow up. Baseline data on socioeconomic and psychosocial factors, nutrition, alcohol and biological samples are being collected on random samples of men and women 45-69 years old. It is proposed to conduct a new wave of data collection (Wave II) and to add Lithuania (as an example of a Baltic country). As far as possible, the study instruments will be identical to those used in HRS and ELSA, focusing on functioning and disability, cognition, quality of life, socioeconomic position, economics, and psychosocial factors. The expected total size of the new study is 28,000 subjects. Analyses will examine cross-sectional outcomes, changes in health and functioning between the baseline and Wave II, and incidence of CVD and mortality since the baseline.         ",Health disparities and aging in societies in transition,7480220,R01AG023522,"['Sampling ', ' Cognition ', ' Accounting ', ' Communism ', ' Marxism ', ' Communities ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' instrument ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Russia ', ' Russian SFSR ', ' Russian S.F.S.R.

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application to continue the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) at the University of Michigan and Wayne State University. Conceptually, the research and training activities of the proposed center build upon a social and behavioral science model of health promotion and health behaviors that emphasize the intersection of structural statuses (especially socio- economic), gender, and race/ethnicity in influencing health outcomes. It is life-course oriented and assumes that statuses and conditions in older ages among ethnic and racial minorities begin at earlier periods of the life-course and are amenable to culturally sensitive and appropriate interventions. The model grows out of our research on productive roles among the elderly and focuses attention on elements of effective aging that are culturally relevant and efficacious in influencing positive health and functioning outcomes. The proposed MCUAAAR would be organized into three cores. The Administrative Core will provide administrative support, facilitate intellectual interchange, and provide overall coordination within the proposed Center, and with other university units and community based organizations. The Community Liaison Core will work with existing, and build new, community research and service relationships, provide sources of cooperating community respondents for the proposed pilot research and intervention efforts, and develop a new public policy outreach initiative. The Investigator Development Core will identify, select, and mentor multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural investigators interested in research and interventions on the health of minority elders. Although a separate measurement core is not proposed, investigators skilled in measurement and methodology will work within the Administrative Core to refine and hone the research interests of all the investigators, but especially young scholars conducting the pilot studies. This application builds upon the work and expertise of faculty and students in these two state institutions to empirically investigate African American health inequalities over the life-course. We have been fortunate in developing a knowledgeable group of research personnel and attracting to each university a large number of multi-ethnic core and affiliated faculty, many of them former MCUAAAR Scholars, and graduate students with interests in the study of aging and human development in black and other minority populations. The MCUAAAR will continue to support a multi- disciplinary and multi-ethnic team of established researchers and appropriately mentored early investigators. We are committed to building and maintaining research infra-structures for mentoring new minority researchers, enhancing the diversity of future social and behavioral science aging researchers, and improving current, and developing new, strategies for recruiting and retaining older minority participants in health related research among the growing diverse elderly populations.           ",Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging,7502219,P30AG015281,[''],NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2008,919960,0.1385110248884583
"Trust in Health Care and Racial Disparities in an Aging Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Important disparities between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites exist in late- life health. These disparities cannot be fully explained by socio-economic differences between these two groups. Lower heath care trust among African Americans is a likely contributor to these disparities that has not been explored in older populations. The overall goals of the proposed project are to examine differences in health care trust between older African Americans and non-Hispanic whites and to evaluate the degree to which these differences contribute to racial disparities in health in older age. The specific aims of the project are: (1) To describe the socio-demographic and psychological correlates of health care trust among a population sample of aging African Americans and non-Hispanic whites and how they differ across these two groups; (2) To test the relationship between health care trust and racial differences in blood pressure control and in disability in an aging population; and (3), in an exploratory aim, to examine the extent to which patterns of health care utilization as measured by physician visits and hospitalizations mediate the contribution of health care trust to racial differences in blood pressure control and disability. As baby boomers grow older, the aging population becomes more diverse, and the cost of health care grows, it is critical that we understand the factors that contribute to racial differences in health in order to ensure interventions designed to improve the health of aging populations are effective for all. There is a need to understand how lower heath care trust among African Americans contributes to the problem of racial disparities in health in aging populations and what factors influence heath care trust in this population.

"Socio-economic status and heterogeneity in aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic status and heterogeneity in aging As people get older there is increasing heterogeneity in health and in physical, mental and cognitive functioning, resulting in age peers becoming more and more dissimilar from each other. Research on the determinants of this heterogeneity is crucial as positive health trajectories are related to higher quality of life, longer independence and considerably lower medical and social care costs. The Whitehall II study on 10,308 British civil servants was set up in 1985 and has played a crucial role in shaping the research agenda on social inequalities in health. Over the last 22 years participants, now aged 55-79 years, have been followed up with medical examinations at 5-year intervals and with questionnaire surveys every second or third year. Thus, Whitehall II is now primed to address one of the major challenges of the new millennium; determinants of heterogeneity in health in ageing populations. NIA support has been crucial to the addition and exploitation of functioning data in the Whitehall II study. As the participants age, this application seeks continued NIA support for further analysis of the data collected so far and to collect two more phases of data over the next 5 years. This support will enable us to address three overall aims. 1) Social inequalities in chronic diseases, mortality and functioning: To examine whether relative and absolute social inequalities in chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes) and mortality increase with age and to estimate the importance of biological, behavioral and psychosocial explanations of these inequalities. To examine the contribution of repeated measures of risk factors to contemporaneous, trajectory and accumulated risk models. To determine whether the consequences of disease on functioning differs or are moderated by socioeconomic status. 2) Cognitive changes in early old age: determinants and consequences: To examine the socioeconomic, vascular and behavioral determinants of heterogeneity in cognitive aging, starting in midlife, and to assess the consequences of cognitive decline on physical, social and mental functioning and mortality. 3) Social participation: impact on health and functioning in early old age: To examine the socioeconomic and gender patterning of social participation trajectories over the adult life course. To examine the effects of social participation on functioning and chronic disease and to address the issues of reverse causation and confounding in the association between social participation and health. The relevance of our research is tied in with continuing increase in life expectancy and the need to identify potentially modifiable risk factors to improve overall health and reduce social inequalities in the health of older populations. Aging trajectories appear to diverge fairly early on and our data on a multitude of risk factors and health measures on individuals from early mid-life to old age are an important resource to study the determinants of heterogeneity in aging trajectories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Whitehall II's first major achievement was to put the social gradient in health high on the research agenda of the scientific community. Testimonies to the success of that early pioneering work are replica studies in a number of countries and research programs to investigate the pathways from social position to health in every continent. Following recognition by the scientific community, the next hurdle was to bring the social gradient to the attention of policy makers. Here the effort of Professor Sir Michael Marmot has brought outstanding success culminating in Sir Michael being asked to chair the ongoing WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. Now, twenty two from its inception, Whitehall II is primed to address one of the major challenges of the new millennium; disparities in health and functioning in an ageing population. Research in this domain is crucial as positive health trajectories are related to higher quality of life, longer independence and considerably lower medical and social care costs.              Relevance Whitehall II's first major achievement was to put the social gradient in health high on the research agenda of the scientific community.

"Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The foundation of this revised competitive resubmission of the Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death (El) program project is the discovery in 2004 that disparities in health and mortality across the wards of the major US cities in 1900 were not only far greater (on the order of 10-to-1) than recognized, but that 84% of the disparities between the worst and best wards had diminished by 1950. When the analysis was pushed back into the 19th century, it was discovered that young adult death rates in the 17 largest cities of 1860, when analyzed longitudinally, were far higher than previously revealed by period life tables. Union Army (UA) recruits from these cities who survived the Civil War had die off rates so high that their experience is characterized by life tables with eo of about 28.6 years, which is about 17.7 years less than life expectancy in rural areas. The explanation of the disparity within and across cities, as well as across rural areas, and the social, economic, and biodemographic factors that lead to the amelioration of these disparities between 1830 and 1950 requires the creation of a data set with ecological variables capable of explaining the process. The collection and management of these data account for three-fourths of the cost of this program project. Four analytical projects initiate the analysis of the new data: Project 1 will analyze how the socioeconomic and health status of UA soldiers and veterans interacted with each other over the life course, stressing interactions across different sub-populations and times. Project 2 focuses on those veterans who lived to be age 95 or older (the last 2% of the cohort) comparing their aging processes with those born just before World War I and investigating whether the effects of earlier life environmental stress persist even to very old ages. Project 3 analyses the impact of exposure to severe within urban environments over different spans of the life course on the process of aging. Project 4 deals with the differences across urban and rural areas in the process of aging.    RELEVANCE: This project bears on the explanation for the marked decline in US age-specific morbidity and mortality rates over the 20th century. It assesses the relative contribution of the decrease in disparities in environmental conditions to long-term improvement in health and longevity in the US and other rich nations and in the Third World. It also provides a basis for forecasting the impact of life-cycle improvements in health experienced by parents and grandparents of baby-boom and baby-dearth generations on the health of their progeny and some likely changes in the process of aging in the first half of the 21st century.          ","Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death",7562837,P01AG010120,[''],NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2009,1843612,0.09136335581566958
"Harmonization of Longitudinal Cross-National Surveys of Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to utilize the outcomes of concerted post hoc (ex-post) efforts to compare existing data on subjective well-being (SWB) collected in the contexts of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) to develop a priori (ex-ante) harmonization strategies to facilitate future innovative comparative research on this topic. Our overall aim is to compare cross-national trends and correlates of SWB in populations aged 50- and-older using the extensive data available from these studies. Previous efforts at ex-post HRS-ELSA comparisons have focused on the role of socioeconomic factors in health (Banks, Marmot, Oldfield, & Smith, 2006). This important pioneering research pointed to the scientific and policy value of exploring trends in health status observed in nationally representative surveys the US and England because of the different demographic structures and social contexts of the aged populations in each country. Cross-national comparisons of well-being would complement and extend this initial work. Like physical health, measures of SWB (e.g. life satisfaction, positive and negative affect) are important components of life quality and successful aging. However, before such HRS-ELSA analyses on SWB can be undertaken, a platform is needed to facilitate the exchange of data and information between researchers from each project. Preliminary analyses of well-being indicators suggest that, although the potential to conduct cross-national comparisons exists, several methodological issues need to be addressed. These include the possible confounding effects of measurement differences and the impact of sample composition and attrition. Ideally harmonization of measurement should occur prior to data collection if cross-national comparison is intended. To this end, we plan to use the opportunity provided by the HRS-ELSA exchanges and secondary analyses to develop new ways to assess SWB (e.g., by combining time-use and evaluative self-report data on activities). This will serve to optimize future cross-national comparisons not only between HRS and ELSA but also with countries in the SHARE network. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative This project will establish a platform to consolidate and compare information about the level and correlates of subjective well-being in the over-50 population in the USA, UK and mainland Europe. Comparisons of well-being in countries with different demographic structures and rates of aging, provide important information about the differential efficacy of national health, financial, and social policies to ensure the life quality of their older citizens and minimize disparities within and between generations.             Project Narrative This project will establish a platform to consolidate and compare information about the level and correlates of subjective well-being in the over-50 population in the USA, UK and mainland Europe.

"Non-Intrusive Automated Portable Data Collection System for Aging Surveys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cells and Surveys report (National Research Council 2000) reports that collecting biological information dramatically improves the value of household surveys by adding a rich dataset of information to longitudinal databases that is not collected today. In fact, since the Cells and Surveys report the collection of biological data and performance measures (in addition to demographic, socioeconomic, cognitive, attitudinal and health data) from individuals in household surveys have become increasingly common. Such data is not only of use to academic researchers, but to insurers, health care providers, HMOs, pharmaceutical companies and health and wellness policy analysts. Specific advantages of having rich data sets include 1) Ability to easily conduct population-based comparison research looking for such differences such as healthcare outcome disparities 2) Having such data readily accessible enables an entirely new paradigm of future research such as Bio-demography 3) Enables future studies in a matter of hours versus months or years 4) Enhances research into population level effects of behavioral interventions, new health care initiatives and environmental factors (physical, chemical or biological). The proposed wearable monitoring system to be studied in Phase I is anticipated to enable longitudinal (weeks to years) data to be collected with greater ease. This proposal is to determine the design and feasibility wearable monitoring for population-based aging research surveys. It is fully responsive to PA-06-471 with a non-intrusive (or non-obtrusive) wireless data collection system to increase the portability, speed, ease and cost-effectiveness of collecting biological data and performance measures in household surveys. The proposed system includes the following components: 1. A wearable, non-intrusive (wrist watch type), wireless device for the collection of physiological and environmental event data specifically tailored for aging research. The device is intended to be worn continuously for a set period of time after the initial interview. 2. A portable wireless connection system (PANDA - Powered Automated Network Data Aggregator) for the wearable device to securely and wirelessly communicate its data to remote servers. The device will also store data if a connection to a remote database server is not available. 3. A new paradigm for an elderly user interface via `surface computing' touch screens via a mobile, Apple iPhone to support easier mobile subject interaction anytime, anywhere in answering survey questions and providing alerts to the subject. 4. A data storage capability and data query software that runs on the remote server. This part of the system integrates the wireless physiological and environmental data with all other data streams collected. It performs the data management and transfers integrated records to the remote longitudinal database from anywhere at anytime using distributed, secure network computing via the Internet. This Phase I proposal is made in collaboration with a senior researcher in the field, Dr. Neil Charness, Professor of Psychology, Florida State University. The scope of initial `mobile' data to be collected in real-time includes Pulse Oximetry, Heart Rate, Skin temperature, movement/gait analysis and a questionnaire. Upon establishing the platform, external third-party devices for additional biomarker or environmental sensor data collection can be supported using standards-based open interfaces. This expanded set of data could include electrical physiological data (ECG, EEG), blood spot assay measures, reaction time assessments, sense function assessments (visual, olfactory, auditory, etc.), strength assessments, mobility/function assessments, and any future devices that will be developed. AFrame has developed a prototype end-to-end wearable system that includes a wrist sensor (fall detection, location information, pulse oximetry/heart rate, skin temperature, ambient temperature and software settable buttons - panic, etc.), a PANDA gateway and advanced analytic (Bayesian) remote server software that processes the real-time event data. Bluetooth connectivity is being added to support receipt of blood glucose measurements and weight scale data. The system is slated for commercial use in eldercare health monitoring applications starting in the second half of 2008. It is proposed that adaptations to the system including direct user interface data capture of questionnaires and expanded data capture will be of value to aging survey based research.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project supports the collection of data in longitudinal surveys of the elderly.

It is life-course oriented and assumes that statuses and conditions in older ages among ethnic and racial minorities begin at earlier periods of the life-course and are amenable to culturally sensitive and appropriate interventions. The model grows out of our research on productive roles among the elderly and focuses attention on elements of effective aging that are culturally relevant and efficacious in influencing positive health and functioning outcomes. The proposed MCUAAAR would be organized into three cores. The Administrative Core will provide administrative support, facilitate intellectual interchange, and provide overall coordination within the proposed Center, and with other university units and community based organizations. The Community Liaison Core will work with existing, and build new, community research and service relationships, provide sources of cooperating community respondents for the proposed pilot research and intervention efforts, and develop a new public policy outreach initiative. The Investigator Development Core will identify, select, and mentor multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural investigators interested in research and interventions on the health of minority elders. Although a separate measurement core is not proposed, investigators skilled in measurement and methodology will work within the Administrative Core to refine and hone the research interests of all the investigators, but especially young scholars conducting the pilot studies. This application builds upon the work and expertise of faculty and students in these two state institutions to empirically investigate African American health inequalities over the life-course.

"Ethnic Trajectories of Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging research has been increasingly focused on examining the intersections between aging and putative social factors involved in determining physical and mental health status. Much of the research is based on cross-sectional data. Furthermore, existing longitudinal analyses are mostly concerned with transitions between two points in time. This proposed research analyzes trajectories of health and health care, consisting of multiple transitions amongwhite, black and Latino older Americans. It has three specific aims. First, we are interested in how health status changes in old age for whites, blacks and Latinos. Second, this proposal will explore the changes in the use of medical care at older ages by ethnic group, specifically for blacks, whites and Latinos in the U.S. will be examined via these analyses. Third, this research will assess the extent to which changes in health status interface with those in health care utilization. Using population based samples representing different ethnic groups, we hope to cross-validate prior observations and to further explore the heterogeneity underlying the age norms of health care utilization and health status. To evaluate the research questions posed, hierarchical linear models will be used. In particular, ethnic differences in changes in health trajectories (health status as well as service utilization) within an older person will be represented by growth curves. The data used for these proposed analyses will come from an ongoing nationally representative public use longitudinal survey, the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) collected at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the trends of disability and decline in old age is of critical importance to health policymakers. In particular, identifying the challenges posed by an aging population with worse health outcomes for some groups relative to others is a necessary social planning instrument. This research proposes to examine the health and health care trends of older white, black and Latino Americans to determine whether such differential patterns in aging are at play.             ",Ethnic Trajectories of Aging,7736795,F31AG029783,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Glean ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' trend ', ' Family ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aging ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Medical ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Institutes ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linear Models ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Sample Size ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Michigan ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Play ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Retirement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Planning ', ' Health Transition ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Sampling ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Health financing ', ' comparative ', ' stem ', ' service utilization ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2009,32379,0.05018232600713807
"Geographic Variation in Cardiovascular Inflammation in Middle-aged & Elderly Popu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the US, and a significant source of racial and socioeconomic disparities in morbidity among aging populations. Chronic inflammation is thought to underlie the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and the development of cardiovascular disease. There are racial and socioeconomic disparities in biomarkers of cardiovascular inflammation that increase across middle and older age, particularly among women. These disparities are not completely explained by traditional risk factors at the individual level, including behavioral risk factors. Area-level socioeconomic status may influence the incidence of cardiovascular disease by promoting inflammation. The candidate seeks training to investigate the role of metropolitan area and neighborhood level social factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular inflammation among aging populations. The proposed research has a novel focus on geographic social determinants of pre-disease risk markers of inflammation. The candidate is trained in Internal Medicine (MD) and Social Epidemiology (SD). The candidate brings experience evaluating social exposures at the individual level among middle-aged and elder adults. Over five years, the candidate will acquire training in (1) physiology and regulation of cardiovascular inflammatory pathways, (2) analytic techniques to integrate geographic data on social factors with biologic data in epidemiologic research, and (3) leadership in interdisciplinary research in diverse and aging populations. This training provides preparation for the candidate's long-term career goal to investigate area-level socioeconomic factors that contribute to pre-disease cardiovascular risk factors in diverse and aging populations. The proposed training program will be mentored by Dr. Lisa Berkman (primary mentor. Social Epidemiologist, social influences on aging, interdisciplinary epidemiology research) and Dr. Paul Ridker (Cardiologist, cardiovascular inflammation in atherosclerosis, cardiac event risk prediction among women). A team of advisors will (1) provide training in geographic analysis, and (2) support working with the two study populations. The proposed research will be conducted in the (1) Women's Health Study (WHS) and the (2) Jackson Heart Study (JHS). Publications stemming from these investigations will enhance scientific understandings of geographic variation in cardiovascular disease risks among middle-aged and elder populations. RELEVANCE: Investigators who are trained to investigate connections between social factors and biomarkers of disease risk are needed to guide social and behavioral interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiovascular disease in diverse and aging populations. Connecting geographic level socioeconomic status to biomarkers of inflammation is a new contribution to population-based prevention approaches to CVD risk reduction among elders.           ",Geographic Variation in Cardiovascular Inflammation in Middle-aged & Elderly Popu,7739069,K08AG032357,"['cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Cardiac ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' Age ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Heart ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' African ', ' Literature ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity -

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application to continue the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) at the University of Michigan and Wayne State University. Conceptually, the research and training activities of the proposed center build upon a social and behavioral science model of health promotion and health behaviors that emphasize the intersection of structural statuses (especially socio- economic), gender, and race/ethnicity in influencing health outcomes. It is life-course oriented and assumes that statuses and conditions in older ages among ethnic and racial minorities begin at earlier periods of the life-course and are amenable to culturally sensitive and appropriate interventions. The model grows out of our research on productive roles among the elderly and focuses attention on elements of effective aging that are culturally relevant and efficacious in influencing positive health and functioning outcomes. The proposed MCUAAAR would be organized into three cores. The Administrative Core will provide administrative support, facilitate intellectual interchange, and provide overall coordination within the proposed Center, and with other university units and community based organizations. The Community Liaison Core will work with existing, and build new, community research and service relationships, provide sources of cooperating community respondents for the proposed pilot research and intervention efforts, and develop a new public policy outreach initiative. The Investigator Development Core will identify, select, and mentor multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural investigators interested in research and interventions on the health of minority elders. Although a separate measurement core is not proposed, investigators skilled in measurement and methodology will work within the Administrative Core to refine and hone the research interests of all the investigators, but especially young scholars conducting the pilot studies. This application builds upon the work and expertise of faculty and students in these two state institutions to empirically investigate African American health inequalities over the life-course. We have been fortunate in developing a knowledgeable group of research personnel and attracting to each university a large number of multi-ethnic core and affiliated faculty, many of them former MCUAAAR Scholars, and graduate students with interests in the study of aging and human development in black and other minority populations. The MCUAAAR will continue to support a multi- disciplinary and multi-ethnic team of established researchers and appropriately mentored early investigators. We are committed to building and maintaining research infra-structures for mentoring new minority researchers, enhancing the diversity of future social and behavioral science aging researchers, and improving current, and developing new, strategies for recruiting and retaining older minority participants in health related research among the growing diverse elderly populations.           ",Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging,7669188,P30AG015281,[''],NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2009,664308,0.1385110248884583

"Harmonization of Longitudinal Cross-National Surveys of Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to utilize the outcomes of concerted post hoc (ex-post) efforts to compare existing data on subjective well-being (SWB) collected in the contexts of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) to develop a priori (ex-ante) harmonization strategies to facilitate future innovative comparative research on this topic. Our overall aim is to compare cross-national trends and correlates of SWB in populations aged 50- and-older using the extensive data available from these studies. Previous efforts at ex-post HRS-ELSA comparisons have focused on the role of socioeconomic factors in health (Banks, Marmot, Oldfield, & Smith, 2006). This important pioneering research pointed to the scientific and policy value of exploring trends in health status observed in nationally representative surveys the US and England because of the different demographic structures and social contexts of the aged populations in each country. Cross-national comparisons of well-being would complement and extend this initial work. Like physical health, measures of SWB (e.g. life satisfaction, positive and negative affect) are important components of life quality and successful aging. However, before such HRS-ELSA analyses on SWB can be undertaken, a platform is needed to facilitate the exchange of data and information between researchers from each project. Preliminary analyses of well-being indicators suggest that, although the potential to conduct cross-national comparisons exists, several methodological issues need to be addressed. These include the possible confounding effects of measurement differences and the impact of sample composition and attrition. Ideally harmonization of measurement should occur prior to data collection if cross-national comparison is intended. To this end, we plan to use the opportunity provided by the HRS-ELSA exchanges and secondary analyses to develop new ways to assess SWB (e.g., by combining time-use and evaluative self-report data on activities). This will serve to optimize future cross-national comparisons not only between HRS and ELSA but also with countries in the SHARE network. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative This project will establish a platform to consolidate and compare information about the level and correlates of subjective well-being in the over-50 population in the USA, UK and mainland Europe. Comparisons of well-being in countries with different demographic structures and rates of aging, provide important information about the differential efficacy of national health, financial, and social policies to ensure the life quality of their older citizens and minimize disparities within and between generations.             Project Narrative This project will establish a platform to consolidate and compare information about the level and correlates of subjective well-being in the over-50 population in the USA, UK and mainland Europe.

"Trust in Health Care and Racial Disparities in an Aging Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Important disparities between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites exist in late- life health. These disparities cannot be fully explained by socio-economic differences between these two groups. Lower heath care trust among African Americans is a likely contributor to these disparities that has not been explored in older populations. The overall goals of the proposed project are to examine differences in health care trust between older African Americans and non-Hispanic whites and to evaluate the degree to which these differences contribute to racial disparities in health in older age. The specific aims of the project are: (1) To describe the socio-demographic and psychological correlates of health care trust among a population sample of aging African Americans and non-Hispanic whites and how they differ across these two groups; (2) To test the relationship between health care trust and racial differences in blood pressure control and in disability in an aging population; and (3), in an exploratory aim, to examine the extent to which patterns of health care utilization as measured by physician visits and hospitalizations mediate the contribution of health care trust to racial differences in blood pressure control and disability. As baby boomers grow older, the aging population becomes more diverse, and the cost of health care grows, it is critical that we understand the factors that contribute to racial differences in health in order to ensure interventions designed to improve the health of aging populations are effective for all. There is a need to understand how lower heath care trust among African Americans contributes to the problem of racial disparities in health in aging populations and what factors influence heath care trust in this population.

"Economics of Aging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NBER Program Project on the Economics of Aging is a coordinated set of research projects on the health and economic circumstances of individuals as they age and on the implications of population aging. Funded initially in 1986, its six major themes are: work and retirement behavior, financial circumstances, health and health care, relationships between socioeconomic circumstances and health, population aging around the world, and behavioral economics. There are eight projects proposed for the next five year phase of the program. Project 1 extends ongoing work on financial status, focusing on the drawdown of assets after retirement and their relationship to family transitions and health shocks. Project 2 analyzes the economic, psychological, environmental, genetic, and biological factors that together influence economic decision-making, including analysis of experimental interventions that induce welfare-enhancing behavior change in health and saving. Project 3 dissects the multiple dimensions of health among the U.S. elderly population, the pathways through which health and functional ability decline, and how population health and disability are changing over time. Project 4 extends ongoing work on social security systems and retirement around the world, but with a new emphasis on how disability programs and health interact in influencing labor market behavior at older ages. Project 5 extends ongoing work on aging, health, and well-being with an expanded focus on the links between socioeconomic factors and health in early and later life, and on measuring well-being. Project 6 extends ongoing work on life conditions in a poor region of rural India, including analytical work on two completed experimental health interventions and the implementation of a new intervention on the impact of increased pension allowances. Project 7 studies the relationship between economic circumstances and health by analyzing in detail how recent declines in financial and housing markets are affecting health. Project 8 analyzes the characteristics and root causes of racial disparities in health and health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With the leading edge of the baby boom generation now eligible for Social Security, the U.S. population age 62 and older is projected to increase by 70 percent in just 20 years.

"Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The foundation of this revised competitive resubmission of the Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death (El) program project is the discovery in 2004 that disparities in health and mortality across the wards of the major US cities in 1900 were not only far greater (on the order of 10-to-1) than recognized, but that 84% of the disparities between the worst and best wards had diminished by 1950. When the analysis was pushed back into the 19th century, it was discovered that young adult death rates in the 17 largest cities of 1860, when analyzed longitudinally, were far higher than previously revealed by period life tables. Union Army (UA) recruits from these cities who survived the Civil War had die off rates so high that their experience is characterized by life tables with eo of about 28.6 years, which is about 17.7 years less than life expectancy in rural areas. The explanation of the disparity within and across cities, as well as across rural areas, and the social, economic, and biodemographic factors that lead to the amelioration of these disparities between 1830 and 1950 requires the creation of a data set with ecological variables capable of explaining the process. The collection and management of these data account for three-fourths of the cost of this program project. Four analytical projects initiate the analysis of the new data: Project 1 will analyze how the socioeconomic and health status of UA soldiers and veterans interacted with each other over the life course, stressing interactions across different sub-populations and times. Project 2 focuses on those veterans who lived to be age 95 or older (the last 2% of the cohort) comparing their aging processes with those born just before World War I and investigating whether the effects of earlier life environmental stress persist even to very old ages. Project 3 analyses the impact of exposure to severe within urban environments over different spans of the life course on the process of aging. Project 4 deals with the differences across urban and rural areas in the process of aging. RELEVANCE: This project bears on the explanation for the marked decline in US age-specific morbidity and mortality rates over the 20th century. It assesses the relative contribution of the decrease in disparities in environmental conditions to long-term improvement in health and longevity in the US and other rich nations and in the Third World. It also provides a basis for forecasting the impact of life-cycle improvements in health experienced by parents and grandparents of baby-boom and baby-dearth generations on the health of their progeny and some likely changes in the process of aging in the first half of the 21st century.","Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death",7775080,P01AG010120,"['Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Soldier ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' social ', ' Generations ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Cities ', ' Accounting ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' ward ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' World War I ', ' Great War ', ' First World War ', ' 1st World War ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Foundations ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Death Rate ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Tables ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Exposure to ', ' grandparent ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' War ', ' Work ', ' Baby Booms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2010,1861947,0.09136335581566958

"Social status, cellular aging, and mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A large body of evidence links low socioeconomic status (SES) to the development of age- related diseases and to earlier mortality. The biological mechanisms are not well elucidated, although it appears to be in part through chronic exposure to stressful conditions and stress-mediated damage. The maintenance of telomeres (the DNA caps at the ends of chromosomes) may be mechanistically involved in disease processes and premature mortality. Leukocyte telomere length generally shortens with chronological age and with chronic stress, and predicts mortality independent of age. Further, a recent study found shorter telomeres in people with low socioeconomic status (SES). Leukocyte telomere length thus may link social disadvantage to earlier mortality, and is the focus of this study.  Methods: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999- 2002, the proposed study will be the first to examine telomere length in a nationally representative sample, allowing us to expand on past findings linking SES to shorter telomere length, and telomere length to mortality. We will be able to examine these relationships in a racially and ethnically diverse sample, and examine moderating effects of genetic vulnerabilities, as well as mediating effects of health behaviors and mental health. Our interdisciplinary team represents epidemiology, genetics, biostatistics, psychology, and sociology.  We will measure telomere length and polymorphisms in three genes (TERT, TERC, PINX1) that regulate telomere length from archived DNA in approximately 7,200 men and women, aged 20 to 85+, who participated in the NHANES 1999-2002 study. We will examine whether SES predicts telomere length and whether this is mediated by health behaviors and mental health. We will also examine gene-environment interactions, specifically whether low SES interacts with polymorphisms in these 3 genes to predict telomere length. Lastly, in the sample over 50 years of age, we will examine whether telomere length predicts mortality 8 years later, and whether telomere length mediates the well-established relationship between SES and mortality. For all analyses, we will examine whether relationships exist across the entire sample and within three racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Mexican-Americans, African-Americans, and non-Hispanic Whites).  Relevance: This study will help determine if social disadvantage is linked to telomere shortening; the behavioral and mental health mediators and genetic moderators of the association between SES and telomere length; and if telomere length mediates the relationship between low SES and early mortality. It will thus help determine whether telomere length might become a useful risk factor to monitor and target of intervention. Understanding the aging process is central to preventing premature morbidity and mortality and to lengthening the healthy lifespan.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will inform possible interventions and policies to help the nation to achieve the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities, which necessitates understanding the mechanisms by which disparities develop. Findings from the proposed research will shed light on cellular aging as a biological pathway through which social disadvantage may increase vulnerability to premature mortality. Using a nationally representative sample, it will provide data on the role of socioeconomic status within and across racial/ethnic groups and the interaction with genetic vulnerabilities in determining cell aging, and in turn, how cell aging predicts mortality.        PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will inform possible interventions and policies to help the nation to achieve the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities, which necessitates understanding the mechanisms by which disparities develop.

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application to continue the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) at the University of Michigan and Wayne State University. Conceptually, the research and training activities of the proposed center build upon a social and behavioral science model of health promotion and health behaviors that emphasize the intersection of structural statuses (especially socio- economic), gender, and race/ethnicity in influencing health outcomes. It is life-course oriented and assumes that statuses and conditions in older ages among ethnic and racial minorities begin at earlier periods of the life-course and are amenable to culturally sensitive and appropriate interventions. The model grows out of our research on productive roles among the elderly and focuses attention on elements of effective aging that are culturally relevant and efficacious in influencing positive health and functioning outcomes. The proposed MCUAAAR would be organized into three cores. The Administrative Core will provide administrative support, facilitate intellectual interchange, and provide overall coordination within the proposed Center, and with other university units and community based organizations. The Community Liaison Core will work with existing, and build new, community research and service relationships, provide sources of cooperating community respondents for the proposed pilot research and intervention efforts, and develop a new public policy outreach initiative. The Investigator Development Core will identify, select, and mentor multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural investigators interested in research and interventions on the health of minority elders. Although a separate measurement core is not proposed, investigators skilled in measurement and methodology will work within the Administrative Core to refine and hone the research interests of all the investigators, but especially young scholars conducting the pilot studies. This application builds upon the work and expertise of faculty and students in these two state institutions to empirically investigate African American health inequalities over the life-course. We have been fortunate in developing a knowledgeable group of research personnel and attracting to each university a large number of multi-ethnic core and affiliated faculty, many of them former MCUAAAR Scholars, and graduate students with interests in the study of aging and human development in black and other minority populations. The MCUAAAR will continue to support a multi- disciplinary and multi-ethnic team of established researchers and appropriately mentored early investigators. We are committed to building and maintaining research infra-structures for mentoring new minority researchers, enhancing the diversity of future social and behavioral science aging researchers, and improving current, and developing new, strategies for recruiting and retaining older minority participants in health related research among the growing diverse elderly populations.           ",Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging,7917228,P30AG015281,[''],NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2010,1098260,0.1385110248884583
"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for competitive funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for the period 2010 - 2014. ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) in the United States, and recruited 12,100 men and women aged 50 and above who were representative of the older population of England. ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with half of the funding coming from a consortium of UK Government Departments. This renewal request is to fund two waves of data collection - wave 5 (2010/11) and wave 6 (2012/13) - and associated analyses.

"Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) was established at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in 1997. CADC was one of the six original Centers funded by the Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) program by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute on Nursing Research and the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities. Over the first 5 years (1997-2002), CADC expanded the strong research foundation for scholarship on health disparities at UCSF. CADC was renewed for a 2nd five-year period (2002-2007) under the RCMAR program and was 1 of 4 Centers that have been successfully funded for both cycles. Over these 9 years, health disparities research has achieved a level of priority at the institution that is unparalleled. The coinciding of national trends, demographic changes and human resources at UCSF contributed to this transformation. CADC has been in part responsible for this evolution and has become the focal point for minority aging research and also for training a cadre of diverse multidisciplinary investigators who will define the health disparities research agenda for years to come. The Overall Specific Aims of the entire application reflect overall goals of the Cores as follows: 1. Sustain and expand the organizational structure and expertise of the CADC at UCSF to foster the development of minority investigators by funding pilot projects and establishing mentoring relationships so these investigators will complete the projects and publish their research. 2.

"Socio-economic status and heterogeneity in aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic status and heterogeneity in aging As people get older there is increasing heterogeneity in health and in physical, mental and cognitive functioning, resulting in age peers becoming more and more dissimilar from each other. Research on the determinants of this heterogeneity is crucial as positive health trajectories are related to higher quality of life, longer independence and considerably lower medical and social care costs. The Whitehall II study on 10,308 British civil servants was set up in 1985 and has played a crucial role in shaping the research agenda on social inequalities in health. Over the last 22 years participants, now aged 55-79 years, have been followed up with medical examinations at 5-year intervals and with questionnaire surveys every second or third year. Thus, Whitehall II is now primed to address one of the major challenges of the new millennium; determinants of heterogeneity in health in ageing populations. NIA support has been crucial to the addition and exploitation of functioning data in the Whitehall II study. As the participants age, this application seeks continued NIA support for further analysis of the data collected so far and to collect two more phases of data over the next 5 years. This support will enable us to address three overall aims. 1) Social inequalities in chronic diseases, mortality and functioning: To examine whether relative and absolute social inequalities in chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes) and mortality increase with age and to estimate the importance of biological, behavioral and psychosocial explanations of these inequalities. To examine the contribution of repeated measures of risk factors to contemporaneous, trajectory and accumulated risk models. To determine whether the consequences of disease on functioning differs or are moderated by socioeconomic status. 2) Cognitive changes in early old age: determinants and consequences: To examine the socioeconomic, vascular and behavioral determinants of heterogeneity in cognitive aging, starting in midlife, and to assess the consequences of cognitive decline on physical, social and mental functioning and mortality. 3) Social participation: impact on health and functioning in early old age: To examine the socioeconomic and gender patterning of social participation trajectories over the adult life course. To examine the effects of social participation on functioning and chronic disease and to address the issues of reverse causation and confounding in the association between social participation and health. The relevance of our research is tied in with continuing increase in life expectancy and the need to identify potentially modifiable risk factors to improve overall health and reduce social inequalities in the health of older populations. Aging trajectories appear to diverge fairly early on and our data on a multitude of risk factors and health measures on individuals from early mid-life to old age are an important resource to study the determinants of heterogeneity in aging trajectories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Whitehall II's first major achievement was to put the social gradient in health high on the research agenda of the scientific community. Testimonies to the success of that early pioneering work are replica studies in a number of countries and research programs to investigate the pathways from social position to health in every continent. Following recognition by the scientific community, the next hurdle was to bring the social gradient to the attention of policy makers. Here the effort of Professor Sir Michael Marmot has brought outstanding success culminating in Sir Michael being asked to chair the ongoing WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. Now, twenty two from its inception, Whitehall II is primed to address one of the major challenges of the new millennium; disparities in health and functioning in an ageing population. Research in this domain is crucial as positive health trajectories are related to higher quality of life, longer independence and considerably lower medical and social care costs.              Relevance Whitehall II's first major achievement was to put the social gradient in health high on the research agenda of the scientific community.

"Geographic Variation in Cardiovascular Inflammation in Middle-aged & Elderly Popu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the US, and a significant source of racial and socioeconomic disparities in morbidity among aging populations. Chronic inflammation is thought to underlie the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and the development of cardiovascular disease. There are racial and socioeconomic disparities in biomarkers of cardiovascular inflammation that increase across middle and older age, particularly among women. These disparities are not completely explained by traditional risk factors at the individual level, including behavioral risk factors. Area-level socioeconomic status may influence the incidence of cardiovascular disease by promoting inflammation. The candidate seeks training to investigate the role of metropolitan area and neighborhood level social factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular inflammation among aging populations. The proposed research has a novel focus on geographic social determinants of pre-disease risk markers of inflammation. The candidate is trained in Internal Medicine (MD) and Social Epidemiology (SD). The candidate brings experience evaluating social exposures at the individual level among middle-aged and elder adults. Over five years, the candidate will acquire training in (1) physiology and regulation of cardiovascular inflammatory pathways, (2) analytic techniques to integrate geographic data on social factors with biologic data in epidemiologic research, and (3) leadership in interdisciplinary research in diverse and aging populations. This training provides preparation for the candidate's long-term career goal to investigate area-level socioeconomic factors that contribute to pre-disease cardiovascular risk factors in diverse and aging populations. The proposed training program will be mentored by Dr. Lisa Berkman (primary mentor. Social Epidemiologist, social influences on aging, interdisciplinary epidemiology research) and Dr. Paul Ridker (Cardiologist, cardiovascular inflammation in atherosclerosis, cardiac event risk prediction among women). A team of advisors will (1) provide training in geographic analysis, and (2) support working with the two study populations. The proposed research will be conducted in the (1) Women's Health Study (WHS) and the (2) Jackson Heart Study (JHS). Publications stemming from these investigations will enhance scientific understandings of geographic variation in cardiovascular disease risks among middle-aged and elder populations. RELEVANCE: Investigators who are trained to investigate connections between social factors and biomarkers of disease risk are needed to guide social and behavioral interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiovascular disease in diverse and aging populations. Connecting geographic level socioeconomic status to biomarkers of inflammation is a new contribution to population-based prevention approaches to CVD risk reduction among elders.           ",Geographic Variation in Cardiovascular Inflammation in Middle-aged & Elderly Popu,7915399,K08AG032357,"['Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' Age ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Heart ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' African ', ' Literature ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity -

"Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) was established at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in 1997. CADC was one of the six original Centers funded by the Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) program by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute on Nursing Research and the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities. Over the first 5 years (1997-2002), CADC expanded the strong research foundation for scholarship on health disparities at UCSF. CADC was renewed for a 2nd five-year period (2002-2007) under the RCMAR program and was 1 of 4 Centers that have been successfully funded for both cycles. Over these 9 years, health disparities research has achieved a level of priority at the institution that is unparalleled. The coinciding of national trends, demographic changes and human resources at UCSF contributed to this transformation. CADC has been in part responsible for this evolution and has become the focal point for minority aging research and also for training a cadre of diverse multidisciplinary investigators who will define the health disparities research agenda for years to come. The Overall Specific Aims of the entire application reflect overall goals of the Cores as follows: 1. Sustain and expand the organizational structure and expertise of the CADC at UCSF to foster the development of minority investigators by funding pilot projects and establishing mentoring relationships so these investigators will complete the projects and publish their research. 2. Continue mentoring CADC Scholars and other investigators active in minority aging research to their first independent NIA grant. 3. Conduct applied measurement research in minority aging, focusing on concepts that are hypothesized as mechanisms of health disparities. 4. Provide expanded training and technical assistance to CADC Scholars and other UCSF fellows and faculty, in specialized methodological and measurement issues, including recruitment and community-based methods in conducting research in diverse aging communities. 5. Share information about determinants of health and healthcare disparities in the elderly and provide methodological guidelines for conducting minority aging research through our website, publications and presentations at national meetings. 6.

"Socio-economic status and heterogeneity in aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic status and heterogeneity in aging As people get older there is increasing heterogeneity in health and in physical, mental and cognitive functioning, resulting in age peers becoming more and more dissimilar from each other. Research on the determinants of this heterogeneity is crucial as positive health trajectories are related to higher quality of life, longer independence and considerably lower medical and social care costs. The Whitehall II study on 10,308 British civil servants was set up in 1985 and has played a crucial role in shaping the research agenda on social inequalities in health. Over the last 22 years participants, now aged 55-79 years, have been followed up with medical examinations at 5-year intervals and with questionnaire surveys every second or third year. Thus, Whitehall II is now primed to address one of the major challenges of the new millennium; determinants of heterogeneity in health in ageing populations. NIA support has been crucial to the addition and exploitation of functioning data in the Whitehall II study. As the participants age, this application seeks continued NIA support for further analysis of the data collected so far and to collect two more phases of data over the next 5 years. This support will enable us to address three overall aims. 1) Social inequalities in chronic diseases, mortality and functioning: To examine whether relative and absolute social inequalities in chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes) and mortality increase with age and to estimate the importance of biological, behavioral and psychosocial explanations of these inequalities. To examine the contribution of repeated measures of risk factors to contemporaneous, trajectory and accumulated risk models. To determine whether the consequences of disease on functioning differs or are moderated by socioeconomic status. 2) Cognitive changes in early old age: determinants and consequences: To examine the socioeconomic, vascular and behavioral determinants of heterogeneity in cognitive aging, starting in midlife, and to assess the consequences of cognitive decline on physical, social and mental functioning and mortality. 3) Social participation: impact on health and functioning in early old age: To examine the socioeconomic and gender patterning of social participation trajectories over the adult life course. To examine the effects of social participation on functioning and chronic disease and to address the issues of reverse causation and confounding in the association between social participation and health. The relevance of our research is tied in with continuing increase in life expectancy and the need to identify potentially modifiable risk factors to improve overall health and reduce social inequalities in the health of older populations. Aging trajectories appear to diverge fairly early on and our data on a multitude of risk factors and health measures on individuals from early mid-life to old age are an important resource to study the determinants of heterogeneity in aging trajectories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Whitehall II's first major achievement was to put the social gradient in health high on the research agenda of the scientific community. Testimonies to the success of that early pioneering work are replica studies in a number of countries and research programs to investigate the pathways from social position to health in every continent. Following recognition by the scientific community, the next hurdle was to bring the social gradient to the attention of policy makers. Here the effort of Professor Sir Michael Marmot has brought outstanding success culminating in Sir Michael being asked to chair the ongoing WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. Now, twenty two from its inception, Whitehall II is primed to address one of the major challenges of the new millennium; disparities in health and functioning in an ageing population. Research in this domain is crucial as positive health trajectories are related to higher quality of life, longer independence and considerably lower medical and social care costs.              Relevance Whitehall II's first major achievement was to put the social gradient in health high on the research agenda of the scientific community.

"Trust in Health Care and Racial Disparities in an Aging Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Important disparities between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites exist in late- life health. These disparities cannot be fully explained by socio-economic differences between these two groups. Lower heath care trust among African Americans is a likely contributor to these disparities that has not been explored in older populations. The overall goals of the proposed project are to examine differences in health care trust between older African Americans and non-Hispanic whites and to evaluate the degree to which these differences contribute to racial disparities in health in older age. The specific aims of the project are: (1) To describe the socio-demographic and psychological correlates of health care trust among a population sample of aging African Americans and non-Hispanic whites and how they differ across these two groups; (2) To test the relationship between health care trust and racial differences in blood pressure control and in disability in an aging population; and (3), in an exploratory aim, to examine the extent to which patterns of health care utilization as measured by physician visits and hospitalizations mediate the contribution of health care trust to racial differences in blood pressure control and disability. As baby boomers grow older, the aging population becomes more diverse, and the cost of health care grows, it is critical that we understand the factors that contribute to racial differences in health in order to ensure interventions designed to improve the health of aging populations are effective for all. There is a need to understand how lower heath care trust among African Americans contributes to the problem of racial disparities in health in aging populations and what factors influence heath care trust in this population. Public Health Relevance: Important disparities between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites exist in late- life health and they cannot be fully explained by socio-economic differences between these two groups.

"Conference Series on Aging in the Americas: United States and Mexico    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed new installments of the conference series on aging in the Americas (2012-2014) will focus on the state of readiness for addressing the needs of Latino elders and for sustaining their health and well-being.  The most poignant example is the Mexico-U.S. contrast as these societies are contending with multiple  demands for public use of scarce resources and have overlapping, interdependent populations and family  networks transcending both nations.  Thirty papers and six keynote speakers from sociology, psychology, social policy, medicine, economics,  gerontology, demography, epidemiology, and community health will 1) discuss the impact of changing  demographics on community capacity for successful aging, including health, housing, and food security; 2)  create a strategic framework for future transnational comparative research on Hispanics in the U.S. and  Mexico, including issue identification and the available data resources for advancing a high quality research  menu on this fundamental issue; and 3) develop a set of goals for advancing the healthy aging in the Mexican origin  population from a bi-national perspective. Collectively, the research will provide new knowledge on the health consequences of emerging trends in the Americas for Hispanic communities and will inform new strategic initiatives to adequately respond to the accelerating demands of aging populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The coming nexus of aging and diversity faced by the United States will require a greater level of scrutiny and analysis if we are to provide policy solutions to aging and health care in the United States and, by example, in Mexico and throughout Latin America. A conference focusing specifically on increasing scholarly Latino research into the aging process from a bi-national, interdisciplinary, and comparative perspective is vital. The next installments of the Conference Series on Aging in the Americas will make a substantive contribution to the knowledge base, filling a significant vacuum of information on this under-studied but increasingly prominent population and the consensus objectives will inform the NIH Healthy People 2020.               The coming nexus of aging and diversity faced by the United States will require a greater level of scrutiny and analysis if we are to provide policy solutions to aging and health care in the United States and, by example, in Mexico and throughout Latin America.

"Geographic Variation in Cardiovascular Inflammation in Middle-aged & Elderly Popu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the US, and a significant source of racial and socioeconomic disparities in morbidity among aging populations. Chronic inflammation is thought to underlie the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and the development of cardiovascular disease. There are racial and socioeconomic disparities in biomarkers of cardiovascular inflammation that increase across middle and older age, particularly among women. These disparities are not completely explained by traditional risk factors at the individual level, including behavioral risk factors. Area-level socioeconomic status may influence the incidence of cardiovascular disease by promoting inflammation. The candidate seeks training to investigate the role of metropolitan area and neighborhood level social factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular inflammation among aging populations. The proposed research has a novel focus on geographic social determinants of pre-disease risk markers of inflammation. The candidate is trained in Internal Medicine (MD) and Social Epidemiology (SD). The candidate brings experience evaluating social exposures at the individual level among middle-aged and elder adults. Over five years, the candidate will acquire training in (1) physiology and regulation of cardiovascular inflammatory pathways, (2) analytic techniques to integrate geographic data on social factors with biologic data in epidemiologic research, and (3) leadership in interdisciplinary research in diverse and aging populations. This training provides preparation for the candidate's long-term career goal to investigate area-level socioeconomic factors that contribute to pre-disease cardiovascular risk factors in diverse and aging populations. The proposed training program will be mentored by Dr. Lisa Berkman (primary mentor. Social Epidemiologist, social influences on aging, interdisciplinary epidemiology research) and Dr. Paul Ridker (Cardiologist, cardiovascular inflammation in atherosclerosis, cardiac event risk prediction among women). A team of advisors will (1) provide training in geographic analysis, and (2) support working with the two study populations. The proposed research will be conducted in the (1) Women's Health Study (WHS) and the (2) Jackson Heart Study (JHS). Publications stemming from these investigations will enhance scientific understandings of geographic variation in cardiovascular disease risks among middle-aged and elder populations. RELEVANCE: Investigators who are trained to investigate connections between social factors and biomarkers of disease risk are needed to guide social and behavioral interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiovascular disease in diverse and aging populations. Connecting geographic level socioeconomic status to biomarkers of inflammation is a new contribution to population-based prevention approaches to CVD risk reduction among elders.           ",Geographic Variation in Cardiovascular Inflammation in Middle-aged & Elderly Popu,8117075,K08AG032357,"['Disease Marker ', ' Geography ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Censuses ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Population Study ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' social disparities ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Endothelin-1 ', ' Endothelin Type 1 ', ' ET-1 (Endothelin-1) ', ' ET-1 ', ' EDN1 ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' metropolitan ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Mentors ', ' Training Programs ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Woman ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Leadership ', ' Event ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Preparation ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' social ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Severities ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Age ', ' Regulation ', ' Goals ', ' Measures ', ' Clinical ', ' biomarker ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' career ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Dimensions ', ' Area ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Chronic ', ' Modeling ', ' Individual ', ' Work ', ' Cardiac ', ' stem ', ' Inflammation ', ' Research ', ' Techniques ', ' Morbidity -

"Effect of Genetic, Individual & Neighborhood Factors on Telomere Length    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This training grant is being sought by a PhD student entering the dissertation phase of her degree in Epidemiology. The candidate aspires to become a leading independent scientist in the field of aging research. She will devote 100% of her time to this research for the duration of her PhD. Her hands-on training during her dissertation phase, coupled with carefully selected courses, are designed to make her expert in the use of advanced statistical methods to define associations between individual and neighborhood factors, genetic variants, and telomere length. This dual training approach will prepare her for future studies investigating molecular markers associated with aging and the role neighborhood environment and genetics play in health disparities and aging. Throughout this award, she will be mentored by senior experts in behavior, geospatial analyses, aging outcomes, genetics, molecular markers and biostatistics.  The process of cellular aging, as measured by telomere length, likely occurs through the complex interactions of multiple factors over the lifespan. The goal of the research proposed here is to better explain the complex, multifactorial nature of cellular aging using a surrogate biomarker, telomere length. We will undertake a multilevel statistical approach that includes identifying individual-level (Aim 1) and neighborhood- level factors (Aim 2) that affect telomere length and the relationship between telomere genetic variants and telomere length (Aim 3), in an existing multi-ethnic longitudinal cohort of older men. Associations have been reported between telomere length and genetic variants, individual risk behaviors (smoking, body mass index) and sociodemographic variables (an individual's race, sex, social status). However, neighborhood level factors (social isolation, structural decline, violence, etc) represent an important consideration for aging studies since they have been associated with age-related disease and are particularly relevant for older adults, who may live in unfavorable neighborhoods for long time periods. This is the first study to account for the collective effects of multiple factors on telomere length. Using linear regression and backward regression, the applicant will model baseline telomere length (defined by T/S ratio) as a continuous variable, with individual level measures, and select neighborhood factors entered separately as independent variables, using a p-value of 0.20 as the threshold for inclusion. Analyses will be repeated stratifying by race. Clustering and multicollinearity will be considered when assessing the effect of neighborhood variables on telomere length. In order to test the effects of genetic haplotypes in the neighborhood context, we will use multivariable analysis to model telomere length and a vector of covariates identified in Aims 1 and 2. Studies of this nature are critical if genes or individual risk factors affect telomere length more profoundly in certain neighborhood settings. This study will build the foundations of a conceptual model that can be used as the basis for future studies on aging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The association between genetic variants and telomere length may depend on individual and neighborhood risk factors. Using an interdisciplinary, multi-level statistical approach, this research will better explain the complex, multifactorial nature of cellular aging(measured here by telomere length).

"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for competitive funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for the period 2010 - 2014. ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) in the United States, and recruited 12,100 men and women aged 50 and above who were representative of the older population of England. ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with half of the funding coming from a consortium of UK Government Departments. This renewal request is to fund two waves of data collection - wave 5 (2010/11) and wave 6 (2012/13) - and associated analyses. The central objective is to provide data necessary for the exploration of the unfolding dynamic relationships between health and functioning, economic position, social participation/networks and well-being, as people plan for, move into and progress beyond retirement. ELSA is a multidisciplinary study, involving the collection of economic, epidemiological, health, social, psychological, physiological and genetic data. The phase of data collection planned in this application will greatly increase the potential for longitudinal analyses so as to examine causal process.  The scientific agenda of this application is focused on eight broad research topics that are important scientifically while also being relevant to policy. These are the nature and timing of retirement and post retirement labour market activity; the determinants of economic well-being in older age; cognitive functioning and its impact on decision making among older people; disability and the compression of morbidity; economic, social and health inequalities in an ageing population; social participation and social productivity at older ages; the interaction between genetic, biological, and psychosocial determinants of health and mortality; and comparisons of trajectories of health, economic position and well-being at older ages in England and the USA.  The specific objectives of this proposal include the following: 1. Design the survey instruments for further waves of data collection, building on the existing data and  maximizing comparability with other international studies, such as HRS and the Survey of Health, Ageing  and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). 2. Recruit a new cohort of respondents aged 50-53, at wave 5, in order to maintain cross-sectional  representativeness and to study social and cross-cohort trends. 3. Interview approximately 8,400 respondents at wave 5 and 7400 respondents at wave 6. 4. Collect biomedical and physical performance data from respondents at wave 6. 5. Provide seven waves of well-documented panel data to the scientific and policy research community. 6. Carry out analyses of the ELSA data relevant to the core research themes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aging is a major concern to public health, and longitudinal data from a large sample of aging men and women helps us understand the evolution of disability, illness and healthy aging. The multidisciplinary English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collects information about the interrelationships between health and disability, economic position, social participation, cognitive function and well-being that is relevant both to policy and scientific agendas.

"Social status, cellular aging, and mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A large body of evidence links low socioeconomic status (SES) to the development of age- related diseases and to earlier mortality. The biological mechanisms are not well elucidated, although it appears to be in part through chronic exposure to stressful conditions and stress-mediated damage. The maintenance of telomeres (the DNA caps at the ends of chromosomes) may be mechanistically involved in disease processes and premature mortality. Leukocyte telomere length generally shortens with chronological age and with chronic stress, and predicts mortality independent of age. Further, a recent study found shorter telomeres in people with low socioeconomic status (SES). Leukocyte telomere length thus may link social disadvantage to earlier mortality, and is the focus of this study.  Methods: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999- 2002, the proposed study will be the first to examine telomere length in a nationally representative sample, allowing us to expand on past findings linking SES to shorter telomere length, and telomere length to mortality. We will be able to examine these relationships in a racially and ethnically diverse sample, and examine moderating effects of genetic vulnerabilities, as well as mediating effects of health behaviors and mental health. Our interdisciplinary team represents epidemiology, genetics, biostatistics, psychology, and sociology.  We will measure telomere length and polymorphisms in three genes (TERT, TERC, PINX1) that regulate telomere length from archived DNA in approximately 7,200 men and women, aged 20 to 85+, who participated in the NHANES 1999-2002 study. We will examine whether SES predicts telomere length and whether this is mediated by health behaviors and mental health. We will also examine gene-environment interactions, specifically whether low SES interacts with polymorphisms in these 3 genes to predict telomere length. Lastly, in the sample over 50 years of age, we will examine whether telomere length predicts mortality 8 years later, and whether telomere length mediates the well-established relationship between SES and mortality. For all analyses, we will examine whether relationships exist across the entire sample and within three racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Mexican-Americans, African-Americans, and non-Hispanic Whites).  Relevance: This study will help determine if social disadvantage is linked to telomere shortening; the behavioral and mental health mediators and genetic moderators of the association between SES and telomere length; and if telomere length mediates the relationship between low SES and early mortality. It will thus help determine whether telomere length might become a useful risk factor to monitor and target of intervention. Understanding the aging process is central to preventing premature morbidity and mortality and to lengthening the healthy lifespan.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will inform possible interventions and policies to help the nation to achieve the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities, which necessitates understanding the mechanisms by which disparities develop. Findings from the proposed research will shed light on cellular aging as a biological pathway through which social disadvantage may increase vulnerability to premature mortality. Using a nationally representative sample, it will provide data on the role of socioeconomic status within and across racial/ethnic groups and the interaction with genetic vulnerabilities in determining cell aging, and in turn, how cell aging predicts mortality.        PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will inform possible interventions and policies to help the nation to achieve the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities, which necessitates understanding the mechanisms by which disparities develop.

"Enhancing Project Talent: Early Life Impacts on Later Life Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 1960, the American Institutes for Research (AIR) initiated Project TALENT by collecting extensive data, including demographic information, cognitive measures, dispositional traits, and interests, from 440,000 high school students, their teachers, and their guidance counselors. In addition, follow-up surveys 1, 5, and 11 years after high school graduation added information about experiences such as postsecondary education, labor force participation, family formation, and military service. With its large, nationally representative sample of a cohort now in their sixties, longitudinal design, and extensive information on early life experiences, Project TALENT is uniquely suited to be the basis for a major longitudinal study of aging that can address research questions such as what characteristics predict health outcomes such as Alzheimer's disease and health disparities. AIR is currently designing this study, with plans for a 50-year follow-up in 2014. Designing the study requires increased analysis of the existing data by an expanded group of researchers. In its current format, with 843,000 records and 10,000 variables essentially unchanged since the 1970's, the data are difficult and time-consuming to access, and thus their use is often limited. We propose to modernize the data and documentation, bringing them up to the current standards of the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA). Doing so will restore the complete data set and allow for data to be easily accessed and input into any analysis format; enable documentation to be searchable at the variable level across data collections and data years; and fully integrate the data into the NACDA collection. To accomplish this task, staff from AIR and NACDA will collaborate, pairing AIR's in-depth knowledge of Project TALENT with NACDA's state-of-the-art archival expertise. Our plans include integration of Project TALENT into the ICPSR's automated HERMES system, which will allow for regular data updates to be efficiently implemented and for the standard content and format for documentation. Additionally, we will restructure the Project TALENT data files from a series of multiple files into a unified collection supported by an interface that allows users to make informed decisions about data extraction. Project TALENT data continue to be highly relevant today as a research source and analyses of existing data will provide critical information for planning the new follow-up; enhancing the data and documentation will greatly increase their availability to researchers, and will lay the groundwork for planned future releases of Project TALENT, including the addition of linked administrative data. The sheer breadth of Project TALENT insures that it will continue to offer new opportunities for original research on aging, most notably the opportunity to investigate questions about the relationship among physical health, cognitive functioning, socioeconomic, and demographic factors at different stages of life.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In 1960, the American Institutes of Research (AIR) collected extensive data on about 440,000 high school students in Project TALENT and conducted follow-up surveys 1, 5, and 11 years after graduation; with these participants now in their 60s, Project TALENT is uniquely suited to be the basis for a new longitudinal study of aging, and AIR is currently planning a 50-year follow-up study. AIR and the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA) propose to combine their expertise to modernize and archive Project TALENT data files and documentation to meet the demand for increased and easier access by researchers. These newly archived data will facilitate research not previously possible, and will play a key role in conducting necessary analyses to design the study that will transform Project TALENT into an invaluable resource for research on how cognitive, socioeconomic, and demographic factors interact with factors that moderate physical health outcomes, cognitive functioning such as Alzheimer's disease, and health disparities across the life course.              In 1960, the American Institutes of Research (AIR) collected extensive data on about 440,000 high school students in Project TALENT and conducted follow-up surveys 1, 5, and 11 years after graduation; with these participants now in their 60s, Project TALENT is uniquely suited to be the basis for a new longitudinal study of aging, and AIR is currently planning a 50-year follow-up study.

"Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death - Competitive Revision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this revision is to create a public use data set that will enable researchers to overcome the critical barrier to understanding long-run trends in the health of African Americans - lack of data. Over 85 percent of the requested funding is for the creation of a longitudinal data set of 21,000 African American recruits who served in the Union Army. These data provide an unusually rich source of health and socioeconomic information on the cohort of African Americans who reached age 65 circa 1910. Together with an extant sample of 6,000 men already created by this program project, the total sample of African American recruits will be 27,000. The overall analytical aims of this revision are: 1) Establish how this cohort of African Americans fared on a number of health measures, including co-morbidities, at older ages; 2) Compare the health of this cohort of African Americans with the same cohort of white Americans to understand the extent of health disparities at the beginning of the twentieth century and to determine whether health insults left a permanent scar or led to the selection of the hardiest Individuals at late ages; 3) Investigate how differences in exposure to infectious disease, differences in nutritional status, and socioeconomic differentials contributed to any observed health disparities at older ages; 4) Investigate the relative importance of health insults at a young age, middle age, and at old ages, and the interactive effects of these health insults, to the health and mortality of this cohort of African Americans; 5) Investigate how an unearned government income transfer affected how a very poor population (as was true of the African American cohort studied) coped with aging prior to the availability of a social security system. This revision will help fulfill the overarching purpose of the parent grant, which is to gain a more precise understanding of the trajectory of aging for the populations of the first third of twenty-first century that are longer-lived, more affluent, and more urban than their predecessors. It will accomplish this goal by building on the parent grant's incorporation of under-represented groups in the Union Army sample.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This revision will provide evidence on how the shapes of mortality and health trajectories of African Americans evolved over time, during an era that was marked by diverse and rapidly changing ecological, economic, and social conditions. This revision can provide insights into future trends in life expectancy and in the health and disability of the elderly both in the US and in developing countries.                This revision will provide evidence on how the shapes of mortality and health trajectories of African Americans evolved over time, during an era that was marked by diverse and rapidly changing ecological, economic, and social conditions.

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application to continue the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) at the University of Michigan and Wayne State University. Conceptually, the research and training activities of the proposed center build upon a social and behavioral science model of health promotion and health behaviors that emphasize the intersection of structural statuses (especially socio- economic), gender, and race/ethnicity in influencing health outcomes. It is life-course oriented and assumes that statuses and conditions in older ages among ethnic and racial minorities begin at earlier periods of the life-course and are amenable to culturally sensitive and appropriate interventions. The model grows out of our research on productive roles among the elderly and focuses attention on elements of effective aging that are culturally relevant and efficacious in influencing positive health and functioning outcomes. The proposed MCUAAAR would be organized into three cores. The Administrative Core will provide administrative support, facilitate intellectual interchange, and provide overall coordination within the proposed Center, and with other university units and community based organizations. The Community Liaison Core will work with existing, and build new, community research and service relationships, provide sources of cooperating community respondents for the proposed pilot research and intervention efforts, and develop a new public policy outreach initiative. The Investigator Development Core will identify, select, and mentor multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural investigators interested in research and interventions on the health of minority elders. Although a separate measurement core is not proposed, investigators skilled in measurement and methodology will work within the Administrative Core to refine and hone the research interests of all the investigators, but especially young scholars conducting the pilot studies. This application builds upon the work and expertise of faculty and students in these two state institutions to empirically investigate African American health inequalities over the life-course. We have been fortunate in developing a knowledgeable group of research personnel and attracting to each university a large number of multi-ethnic core and affiliated faculty, many of them former MCUAAAR Scholars, and graduate students with interests in the study of aging and human development in black and other minority populations. The MCUAAAR will continue to support a multi- disciplinary and multi-ethnic team of established researchers and appropriately mentored early investigators. We are committed to building and maintaining research infra-structures for mentoring new minority researchers, enhancing the diversity of future social and behavioral science aging researchers, and improving current, and developing new, strategies for recruiting and retaining older minority participants in health related research among the growing diverse elderly populations.           ",Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging,8097286,P30AG015281,[''],NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2011,868931,0.1385110248884583
"A Transdisciplinary Approach to Engage Specialty Investigators in Aging Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""A Transdisciplinary Approach to Engage Specialty Investigators in Aging Research,"" will address the pressing need to develop research priorities and new investigators to address critical health care issues facing the nation's rapidly growing population of older adults. The Association of Subspecialty Professors (ASP) has previously held five similar conferences (on topics such as HIV and aging and acute kidney failure in elderly patients) and aims to extend this series with NIH funding supplemented and leveraged by private foundation support from the John A. Hartford Foundation. Under Aim 1, ASP will hold three research agenda setting meetings from 2012 through 2014 in the areas of solid organ transplantation in elderly patients, diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular (CV) complications in seniors, and wound healing and tissue regeneration in older adults. Each conference will also address the disparities in healthcare among ethnic and racial minorities in these areas. Planning committees and participants for each meeting will include senior and junior faculty in a wide variety of disciplines (e.g. internal medicine, surgery neurology, nursing, and interventional radiology), and representatives of relevant professional organizations as well as appropriate NIH Institutes and Centers. This diverse group will ensure that the conferences serve to bridge disciplines, fill bench-to-bedside gaps in knowledge, and inject key concepts in aging research including senescence, quality of life measures, and frailty into fields generally void of such considerations. Using the meetings outlined in Aim 1 as a vehicle, ASP will build on this work in Aim 2, to focus more broadly on raising the profile of geriatrics and gerontology in key disciplines by engaging with vital researchers in each specialty as well as rising junior faculty ""stars"" in the specialty. In Aim 3, ASP will focus on stimulating research application and fostering career development by engaging NIH IC contacts outside of NIA, publishing the conference proceedings in high impact specialty journals, and training junior scientists in the conduct of aging research through specific development strategies at each meeting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative The Association of Subspecialty Professors' project, ""A Transdisciplinary Approach to Engage Specialty Investigators in Aging Research,"" focuses on improving the health care of America's rapidly aging population. The project will develop roadmaps to guide future research in three conditions disproportionately affecting elderly patients: organ transplantation; cardiovascular complications of diabetes; and would care and tissue regeneration. The project will also address how to overcome the health care disparities racial and ethnic minority populations confront in these areas. To provide a long-term platform for improving care, the project will stimulate continuing education programming and prepare junior researchers to enter life-long careers in studying aging and its interplay with chronic diseases.              Narrative The Association of Subspecialty Professors' project, ""A Transdisciplinary Approach to Engage Specialty Investigators in Aging Research,"" focuses on improving the health care of America's rapidly aging population.

"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for competitive funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for the period 2010 - 2014. ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) in the United States, and recruited 12,100 men and women aged 50 and above who were representative of the older population of England. ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with half of the funding coming from a consortium of UK Government Departments. This renewal request is to fund two waves of data collection - wave 5 (2010/11) and wave 6 (2012/13) - and associated analyses. The central objective is to provide data necessary for the exploration of the unfolding dynamic relationships between health and functioning, economic position, social participation/networks and well-being, as people plan for, move into and progress beyond retirement. ELSA is a multidisciplinary study, involving the collection of economic, epidemiological, health, social, psychological, physiological and genetic data. The phase of data collection planned in this application will greatly increase the potential for longitudinal analyses so as to examine causal process.  The scientific agenda of this application is focused on eight broad research topics that are important scientifically while also being relevant to policy. These are the nature and timing of retirement and post retirement labour market activity; the determinants of economic well-being in older age; cognitive functioning and its impact on decision making among older people; disability and the compression of morbidity; economic, social and health inequalities in an ageing population; social participation and social productivity at older ages; the interaction between genetic, biological, and psychosocial determinants of health and mortality; and comparisons of trajectories of health, economic position and well-being at older ages in England and the USA.  The specific objectives of this proposal include the following: 1. Design the survey instruments for further waves of data collection, building on the existing data and  maximizing comparability with other international studies, such as HRS and the Survey of Health, Ageing  and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). 2. Recruit a new cohort of respondents aged 50-53, at wave 5, in order to maintain cross-sectional  representativeness and to study social and cross-cohort trends. 3.

"Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The foundation of this revised competitive resubmission of the Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death (El) program project is the discovery in 2004 that disparities in health and mortality across the wards of the major US cities in 1900 were not only far greater (on the order of 10-to-1) than recognized, but that 84% of the disparities between the worst and best wards had diminished by 1950. When the analysis was pushed back into the 19th century, it was discovered that young adult death rates in the 17 largest cities of 1860, when analyzed longitudinally, were far higher than previously revealed by period life tables. Union Army (UA) recruits from these cities who survived the Civil War had die off rates so high that their experience is characterized by life tables with eo of about 28.6 years, which is about 17.7 years less than life expectancy in rural areas. The explanation of the disparity within and across cities, as well as across rural areas, and the social, economic, and biodemographic factors that lead to the amelioration of these disparities between 1830 and 1950 requires the creation of a data set with ecological variables capable of explaining the process. The collection and management of these data account for three-fourths of the cost of this program project. Four analytical projects initiate the analysis of the new data: Project 1 will analyze how the socioeconomic and health status of UA soldiers and veterans interacted with each other over the life course, stressing interactions across different sub-populations and times. Project 2 focuses on those veterans who lived to be age 95 or older (the last 2% of the cohort) comparing their aging processes with those born just before World War I and investigating whether the effects of earlier life environmental stress persist even to very old ages. Project 3 analyses the impact of exposure to severe within urban environments over different spans of the life course on the process of aging. Project 4 deals with the differences across urban and rural areas in the process of aging. RELEVANCE: This project bears on the explanation for the marked decline in US age-specific morbidity and mortality rates over the 20th century. It assesses the relative contribution of the decrease in disparities in environmental conditions to long-term improvement in health and longevity in the US and other rich nations and in the Third World. It also provides a basis for forecasting the impact of life-cycle improvements in health experienced by parents and grandparents of baby-boom and baby-dearth generations on the health of their progeny and some likely changes in the process of aging in the first half of the 21st century.","Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death",8026855,P01AG010120,"['Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Death Rate ', ' Veterans ', ' War ', ' Life Tables ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' urban area ', ' World War I ', ' Great War ', ' First World War ', ' 1st World War ', ' grandparent ', ' Cities ', ' Soldier ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Economics ', ' data management ', ' Baby Booms ', ' rural area ', ' Collection ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Stress ', ' Population ', ' social ', ' Foundations ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Parents ', ' Age ', ' Data ', ' base ', ' Accounting ', ' Exposure to ', ' Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' cohort ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Generations ', ' cost ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Work ', ' programs ', ' Life ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Time ', ' Process ', ' Environment ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' experience ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' ward ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2011,2598321,0.09136335581566958
"Trust in Health Care and Racial Disparities in an Aging Population  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Important disparities between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites exist in late- life health. These disparities cannot be fully explained by socio-economic differences between these two groups. Lower heath care trust among African Americans is a likely contributor to these disparities that has not been explored in older populations. The overall goals of the proposed project are to examine differences in health care trust between older African Americans and non-Hispanic whites and to evaluate the degree to which these differences contribute to racial disparities in health in older age. The specific aims of the project are: (1) To describe the socio-demographic and psychological correlates of health care trust among a population sample of aging African Americans and non-Hispanic whites and how they differ across these two groups; (2) To test the relationship between health care trust and racial differences in blood pressure control and in disability in an aging population; and (3), in an exploratory aim, to examine the extent to which patterns of health care utilization as measured by physician visits and hospitalizations mediate the contribution of health care trust to racial differences in blood pressure control and disability. As baby boomers grow older, the aging population becomes more diverse, and the cost of health care grows, it is critical that we understand the factors that contribute to racial differences in health in order to ensure interventions designed to improve the health of aging populations are effective for all. There is a need to understand how lower heath care trust among African Americans contributes to the problem of racial disparities in health in aging populations and what factors influence heath care trust in this population.

"Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) is a collaborative partnership of four unique, Southern institutions with complementary strengths: Morehouse School of Medicine, Tuskegee University, University of Alabama, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham. We have created an infrastructure to provide a mechanism for mentoring sustained research careers; enhance the diversity of the workforce conducting research on the health of older persons; and advance scientific knowledge to reduce health disparities. The Deep South RCMAR focuses on health problems that are particularly prevalent among older African Americans in both rural and urban settings. Our specific aims include: (1) provide high quality research training and individualized career development support for faculty; (2) identify, engage, and mentor outstanding, diverse faculty committed to academic careers in health disparities and aging research; (3) continue support for innovative, high impact pilot projects; (4) provide expertise and resources for working collaboratively with communities and for the recruitment and retention of older African Americans in research; (5) provide expertise and resources for culturally sensitive measurement and analysis; and (6) disseminate to scientific, professional and lay audiences research results. We will achieve these aims through the continuation and enhancements of three cores: Administrative Core; Investigator Development Core; and Community Liaison Core. We propose the addition of a new Analysis Core. We propose to enhance our Advisory Committee composition by formally designating a Community-based Advisory Group, a Professional Advisory Group, and a Scholar Advisory Group. Over the next five years, we will provide career development support for at least 20 scholars through our multi-disciplinary Health Disparities Research Training Program; we will fund at least 15 pilot grant awards; and we will assist at least four faculty members to obtain diversity supplements.

"Social status, cellular aging, and mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A large body of evidence links low socioeconomic status (SES) to the development of age- related diseases and to earlier mortality. The biological mechanisms are not well elucidated, although it appears to be in part through chronic exposure to stressful conditions and stress-mediated damage. The maintenance of telomeres (the DNA caps at the ends of chromosomes) may be mechanistically involved in disease processes and premature mortality. Leukocyte telomere length generally shortens with chronological age and with chronic stress, and predicts mortality independent of age. Further, a recent study found shorter telomeres in people with low socioeconomic status (SES). Leukocyte telomere length thus may link social disadvantage to earlier mortality, and is the focus of this study.  Methods: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999- 2002, the proposed study will be the first to examine telomere length in a nationally representative sample, allowing us to expand on past findings linking SES to shorter telomere length, and telomere length to mortality. We will be able to examine these relationships in a racially and ethnically diverse sample, and examine moderating effects of genetic vulnerabilities, as well as mediating effects of health behaviors and mental health. Our interdisciplinary team represents epidemiology, genetics, biostatistics, psychology, and sociology.  We will measure telomere length and polymorphisms in three genes (TERT, TERC, PINX1) that regulate telomere length from archived DNA in approximately 7,200 men and women, aged 20 to 85+, who participated in the NHANES 1999-2002 study. We will examine whether SES predicts telomere length and whether this is mediated by health behaviors and mental health. We will also examine gene-environment interactions, specifically whether low SES interacts with polymorphisms in these 3 genes to predict telomere length. Lastly, in the sample over 50 years of age, we will examine whether telomere length predicts mortality 8 years later, and whether telomere length mediates the well-established relationship between SES and mortality. For all analyses, we will examine whether relationships exist across the entire sample and within three racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Mexican-Americans, African-Americans, and non-Hispanic Whites).  Relevance: This study will help determine if social disadvantage is linked to telomere shortening; the behavioral and mental health mediators and genetic moderators of the association between SES and telomere length; and if telomere length mediates the relationship between low SES and early mortality. It will thus help determine whether telomere length might become a useful risk factor to monitor and target of intervention. Understanding the aging process is central to preventing premature morbidity and mortality and to lengthening the healthy lifespan.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will inform possible interventions and policies to help the nation to achieve the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities, which necessitates understanding the mechanisms by which disparities develop. Findings from the proposed research will shed light on cellular aging as a biological pathway through which social disadvantage may increase vulnerability to premature mortality. Using a nationally representative sample, it will provide data on the role of socioeconomic status within and across racial/ethnic groups and the interaction with genetic vulnerabilities in determining cell aging, and in turn, how cell aging predicts mortality.

"Conference Series on Aging in the Americas: United States and Mexico Abstract  The proposed new installments of the conference series on aging in the Americas (2012-2014) will focus on  the state of readiness for addressing the needs of Latino elders and for sustaining their health and well-being.  The most poignant example is the Mexico-U.S. contrast as these societies are contending with multiple  demands for public use of scarce resources and have overlapping, interdependent populations and family  networks transcending both nations.  Thirty papers and six keynote speakers from sociology, psychology, social policy, medicine, economics,  gerontology, demography, epidemiology, and community health will 1) discuss the impact of changing  demographics on community capacity for successful aging, including health, housing, and food security; 2)  create a strategic framework for future transnational comparative research on Hispanics in the U.S. and  Mexico, including issue identification and the available data resources for advancing a high quality research  menu on this fundamental issue; and 3) develop a set of goals for advancing the healthy aging in the Mexicanorigin  population from a bi-national perspective. Collectively, the research will provide new knowledge on the  health consequences of emerging trends in the Americas for Hispanic communities and will inform new  strategic initiatives to adequately respond to the accelerating demands of aging populations. Project Narrative  The coming nexus of aging and diversity faced by the United States will require a greater level of scrutiny and  analysis if we are to provide policy solutions to aging and health care in the United States and, by example, in  Mexico and throughout Latin America. A conference focusing specifically on increasing scholarly Latino  research into the aging process from a bi-national, interdisciplinary, and comparative perspective is vital. The  next installments of the Conference Series on Aging in the Americas will make a substantive contribution to the  knowledge base, filling a significant vacuum of information on this under-studied but increasingly prominent  population and the consensus objectives will inform the NIH Healthy People 2020.",Conference Series on Aging in the Americas: United States and Mexico,8335491,R13AG029767,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Budgets ', ' Communities ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Demography ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Latin America ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Peer Review ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Scholarship ', ' Social Policies ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Societies ', ' Sociology ', ' Solutions ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vacuum ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Mexican ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Letters ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Transcend ', ' experience ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Population Research ', ' Research Training ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Community Health ', ' Behavioral ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' food security ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' comparative ', ' demographics ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' healthy aging ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R13,2012,40000,0.10915487011398275

"Energetics, Disparities, & Lifespan: A unified hypothesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The evolution and ontogeny of lifespan at the species and individual level, the energetics of the organism in its environment, the storage of metabolizable energy as body fat, and socioeconomic disparities within populations all seem intricately related and yet the nature of these interrelations is poorly understood. Indeed questions as fundamental as why we age remain open and subsidiary questions such as why caloric restriction leads to increased lifespan and why lower socioeconomic status is related to obesity in developed countries also remain unanswered. Herein, we propose a unified model informed by evolutionary thinking about life strategies which connects these phenomena. In this model, aging or more precisely senescence is not something that passively happens to us as the result of environmental insults or from metabolizing fuel, but is something we do. That is, mortality rate or the rate of aging is seen as (partially) internally regulable phenomenon much like the control of body temperature in homeotherms in which the regulated rate is responsive to perceptions about the energetic state of the environment. From this perspective, it is perceptions of the energetic security of the environment that are a key factor in linking these phenomena. We elaborate this theory herein and from it derive seven specific hypotheses, each of which is testable in a different experiment using model organisms. We have assembled a team of the world's leading researchers to conduct these seven experiments and then to conduct follow-up work to study both a priori specified potential causal mechanisms involving internal clock regulation and also to conduct exploratory work to identify new potential mechanisms.

"Socio-economic status and heterogeneity in aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic status and heterogeneity in aging As people get older there is increasing heterogeneity in health and in physical, mental and cognitive functioning, resulting in age peers becoming more and more dissimilar from each other. Research on the determinants of this heterogeneity is crucial as positive health trajectories are related to higher quality of life, longer independence and considerably lower medical and social care costs. The Whitehall II study on 10,308 British civil servants was set up in 1985 and has played a crucial role in shaping the research agenda on social inequalities in health. Over the last 22 years participants, now aged 55-79 years, have been followed up with medical examinations at 5-year intervals and with questionnaire surveys every second or third year. Thus, Whitehall II is now primed to address one of the major challenges of the new millennium; determinants of heterogeneity in health in ageing populations. NIA support has been crucial to the addition and exploitation of functioning data in the Whitehall II study. As the participants age, this application seeks continued NIA support for further analysis of the data collected so far and to collect two more phases of data over the next 5 years. This support will enable us to address three overall aims. 1) Social inequalities in chronic diseases, mortality and functioning: To examine whether relative and absolute social inequalities in chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes) and mortality increase with age and to estimate the importance of biological, behavioral and psychosocial explanations of these inequalities. To examine the contribution of repeated measures of risk factors to contemporaneous, trajectory and accumulated risk models. To determine whether the consequences of disease on functioning differs or are moderated by socioeconomic status. 2) Cognitive changes in early old age: determinants and consequences: To examine the socioeconomic, vascular and behavioral determinants of heterogeneity in cognitive aging, starting in midlife, and to assess the consequences of cognitive decline on physical, social and mental functioning and mortality. 3) Social participation: impact on health and functioning in early old age: To examine the socioeconomic and gender patterning of social participation trajectories over the adult life course. To examine the effects of social participation on functioning and chronic disease and to address the issues of reverse causation and confounding in the association between social participation and health. The relevance of our research is tied in with continuing increase in life expectancy and the need to identify potentially modifiable risk factors to improve overall health and reduce social inequalities in the health of older populations. Aging trajectories appear to diverge fairly early on and our data on a multitude of risk factors and health measures on individuals from early mid-life to old age are an important resource to study the determinants of heterogeneity in aging trajectories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Whitehall II's first major achievement was to put the social gradient in health high on the research agenda of the scientific community. Testimonies to the success of that early pioneering work are replica studies in a number of countries and research programs to investigate the pathways from social position to health in every continent. Following recognition by the scientific community, the next hurdle was to bring the social gradient to the attention of policy makers. Here the effort of Professor Sir Michael Marmot has brought outstanding success culminating in Sir Michael being asked to chair the ongoing WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. Now, twenty two from its inception, Whitehall II is primed to address one of the major challenges of the new millennium; disparities in health and functioning in an ageing population. Research in this domain is crucial as positive health trajectories are related to higher quality of life, longer independence and considerably lower medical and social care costs.

"Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) The Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) has three research themes: 1) understanding multilevel determinants of disparities, 2) evaluating through secondary data analysis the effects of policies that reduce public services among minority older adults, and 3) translating evidence-based interventions to prevent/manage chronic conditions and mitigate the effects of stressful environments in minority communities. The Administrative Core will coordinate all CADC functions, select pilot studies for funding, host Advisory Board meetings, allocate effort to update the web site, and sustain collaborations with UCSF colleagues. The Investigator Development Core will fund 3-5 scholars every year through the process of Request for Proposals and review. CADC faculty will formally mentor funded scholars to completion of their research, publication of a paper, submission of a faculty development or independent research grant to NIA/NIH, and becoming established in their academic units. The multidisciplinary nature of CADC faculty provide scholars with a variety of content mentors in the clinical, epidemiological, behavioral, and social sciences, including a neuroscientist and health economist. We will promote use of secondary datasets to identify multi-level determinants of disparities and evaluate the impact of policy changes using interrupted time-series methods. We will also encourage scholars to develop pilot interventions to reduce health disparities. The Community Liaison Core will support recruitment of research participants for funded projects, advance the science of recruitment and disseminate research findings to the target communities. The Analysis Core will work closely with scholars to provide technical assistance in specialized methods in minority aging, develop measurement projects to identify determinants of disparities, and provide guidance to pilot test community-based interventions. In sum, CADC will continue to foster development of ethnically diverse investigators who will conduct research with older minority persons at UCSF and in Northern California.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Center for Aging in Diverse Communities is supporting the development of race and ethnic minority scholars who are addressing research topics in minority aging.

"Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The foundation of this revised competitive resubmission of the Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death (El) program project is the discovery in 2004 that disparities in health and mortality across the wards of the major US cities in 1900 were not only far greater (on the order of 10-to-1) than recognized, but that 84% of the disparities between the worst and best wards had diminished by 1950. When the analysis was pushed back into the 19th century, it was discovered that young adult death rates in the 17 largest cities of 1860, when analyzed longitudinally, were far higher than previously revealed by period life tables. Union Army (UA) recruits from these cities who survived the Civil War had die off rates so high that their experience is characterized by life tables with eo of about 28.6 years, which is about 17.7 years less than life expectancy in rural areas. The explanation of the disparity within and across cities, as well as across rural areas, and the social, economic, and biodemographic factors that lead to the amelioration of these disparities between 1830 and 1950 requires the creation of a data set with ecological variables capable of explaining the process. The collection and management of these data account for three-fourths of the cost of this program project. Four analytical projects initiate the analysis of the new data: Project 1 will analyze how the socioeconomic and health status of UA soldiers and veterans interacted with each other over the life course, stressing interactions across different sub-populations and times. Project 2 focuses on those veterans who lived to be age 95 or older (the last 2% of the cohort) comparing their aging processes with those born just before World War I and investigating whether the effects of earlier life environmental stress persist even to very old ages. Project 3 analyses the impact of exposure to severe within urban environments over different spans of the life course on the process of aging. Project 4 deals with the differences across urban and rural areas in the process of aging. RELEVANCE: This project bears on the explanation for the marked decline in US age-specific morbidity and mortality rates over the 20th century. It assesses the relative contribution of the decrease in disparities in environmental conditions to long-term improvement in health and longevity in the US and other rich nations and in the Third World. It also provides a basis for forecasting the impact of life-cycle improvements in health experienced by parents and grandparents of baby-boom and baby-dearth generations on the health of their progeny and some likely changes in the process of aging in the first half of the 21st century.","Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death",8231383,P01AG010120,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Baby Booms ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Cities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Tables ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Parents ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' War ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Death Rate ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Exposure to ', ' grandparent ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Soldier ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' social ', ' ward ', ' Great War ', ' First World War ', ' 1st World War ', ' World War I ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2012,2561515,0.09136335581566958
"USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Advances in medicine and technology are providing for longer and healthier lives today. American families have increasingly been asked to take responsibility for their own health and financial outcomes: how long to work, how much to save, when to claim Social Security and pension benefits, which health plans to choose, and how to allocate and manage their assets. Navigating these complex choices may be particularly difficult for minority elderly, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Indeed, health indicators have demonstrated little improvement in health disparities between different racial and ethnic populations over the past decade, according to analyses in Healthy People 2010. Evidence also suggests that minority households tend to be excluded from or participate only on the margins of the financial mainstream. To this end we propose to establish a RCMAR at USC that will develop an infrastructure to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1. Provide leadership, organizational, communication and evaluation systems to achieve the overarching goal of supporting high-quality and enduring research careers in the health and economic challenges of minority elderly; 2. Support pilot study solicitation and selection process to ensure the selection of scientifically rigorous and fundable pilot projects and enhancement of the diversity of researchers; 3. Support pilot-funded investigators through achievement of pilot studies goals and award of an independent grant by multidisciplinary mentoring and training in the methods and tools of economics, computer science, medicine, and social work; 4. Analyze large longitudinal survey data sets and medical claims data on the health, medical care and expenditures, economic status, and financial decisions of diverse elderly populations in order to generate interventions that will address health and economic disparities; 5. Track and evaluate the successes of pilot investigators and data analysis and improve the infrastructure support in accordance with evaluation findings. This proposed RCMAR is a collaboration between USC and RAND that utilizes the resources of USC's Roybal Center on Health Policy Simulation, Roybal Institute on Aging, Alzheimer Disease Research Center, and RAND's Roybal Center for Financial Decision making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the health and economics issues associated with the aging process are of such magnitude and complexity that they cannot be approached from the vantage point of any single discipline alone. With the National Institute on Aging's Priority Area for RCMAR Centers comes a pressing need to build infrastructure that will bring a multidisciplinary approach to the health and economic challenges of minority elderly and have a long-lasting effect on research in this area.",USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR),8374285,P30AG043073,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Household ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Retirement Benefits ', ' Pensions ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Savings ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' American ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' simulation ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Process ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' financial decision making ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,P30,2012,572069,0.0991894194982518
"Center for Demography of Health and Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal for continuing support of the Center for Demography of Health and Aging at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The overall goal of the Center for Demography of Health and Aging is to sustain and improve a major research and training program in the demography of health and aging.

"Telomere Attrition Rate and Periodontitis: a nested case control study in the ARI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The biological mechanisms underlying racial and socioeconomic disparities in periodontitis are inadequately conceptualized, rarely investigated and poorly understood. Research by our group and others leads to the novel hypothesis that the earlier onset and greater burden of periodontitis in African American and low socioeconomic groups, relative to white race and more advantaged groups, is mediated by an accelerated rate of biological aging. We propose to test this hypothesis using a nested case control study within the prospective cohort Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. This offers an efficient epidemiologic design that capitalizes on the respective strengths of both the case control and the prospective cohort designs. This study will undertake secondary analysis of existing data and stored biospecimen. Periodontitis cases will be compared with healthy controls in the community-based biracial ARIC Study. In 1987-1989, adults aged 45-64 years were recruited from four U.S. communities: Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Washington County, Maryland. Interviews and examinations collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, medical status and biological samples including blood. At Visit 4, when the cohort was aged 54-73 years, 6,691 ARIC Study participants received a full mouth periodontal examination. Cases will be 160 adults with severe periodontitis defined according to a modified case classification of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Periodontology. Controls, who do not have periodontitis (n=160), will be frequency-matched to cases (n=160) by sex, age in years and ARIC field center/race. The biomarker of biological age is leukocyte telomere length (LTL) measured in genomic DNA of stored blood samples collected at Visit 2 (1990-1992) and Visit 4 (1996-1998). DNA will be isolated using PureGene extraction. Relative LTL will be measured using a well- established method of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cross-sectional evidence shows that shorter LTL is associated with higher risk for many chronic and age-related disorders. To date, few prospective studies have measured rates of telomere attrition over time and even fewer of these have compared telomere attrition rates between cases and healthy controls. The study has three specific aims; each aim builds on the prior aim to develop a complete picture of the association of LTL and periodontitis, the rate of LTL attritio in cases and controls, and the degree to race and SES may modify this relationship. Explanatory variables are established risk and protective indicators for periodontitis including smoking, diabetes, body mass index, diet, physical activity, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Achieving all three of the aims will yield a complete and nuanced picture of the effect of biological aging, mediated by social context, on periodontitis outcomes.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a unique opportunity to learn about variation in rates of biological aging between population subgroups, and the role of biological age in the progression of periodontal destruction. Providing insights into the biological basis of social disparities in periodontitis will stimulate new approaches in modalities aimed at reducing the magnitude of disparities in periodontitis and the burden of this disease on society by targeting modifiable aspects of biological aging.                  This is a unique opportunity to learn about variation in rates of biological aging between population subgroups, and the role of biological age in the progression of periodontal destruction.

"Geographic Variation in Cardiovascular Inflammation in Middle-aged & Elderly Popu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the US, and a significant source of racial and socioeconomic disparities in morbidity among aging populations. Chronic inflammation is thought to underlie the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and the development of cardiovascular disease. There are racial and socioeconomic disparities in biomarkers of cardiovascular inflammation that increase across middle and older age, particularly among women. These disparities are not completely explained by traditional risk factors at the individual level, including behavioral risk factors. Area-level socioeconomic status may influence the incidence of cardiovascular disease by promoting inflammation. The candidate seeks training to investigate the role of metropolitan area and neighborhood level social factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular inflammation among aging populations. The proposed research has a novel focus on geographic social determinants of pre-disease risk markers of inflammation. The candidate is trained in Internal Medicine (MD) and Social Epidemiology (SD). The candidate brings experience evaluating social exposures at the individual level among middle-aged and elder adults. Over five years, the candidate will acquire training in (1) physiology and regulation of cardiovascular inflammatory pathways, (2) analytic techniques to integrate geographic data on social factors with biologic data in epidemiologic research, and (3) leadership in interdisciplinary research in diverse and aging populations. This training provides preparation for the candidate's long-term career goal to investigate area-level socioeconomic factors that contribute to pre-disease cardiovascular risk factors in diverse and aging populations. The proposed training program will be mentored by Dr. Lisa Berkman (primary mentor. Social Epidemiologist, social influences on aging, interdisciplinary epidemiology research) and Dr. Paul Ridker (Cardiologist, cardiovascular inflammation in atherosclerosis, cardiac event risk prediction among women). A team of advisors will (1) provide training in geographic analysis, and (2) support working with the two study populations. The proposed research will be conducted in the (1) Women's Health Study (WHS) and the (2) Jackson Heart Study (JHS). Publications stemming from these investigations will enhance scientific understandings of geographic variation in cardiovascular disease risks among middle-aged and elder populations. RELEVANCE: Investigators who are trained to investigate connections between social factors and biomarkers of disease risk are needed to guide social and behavioral interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiovascular disease in diverse and aging populations. Connecting geographic level socioeconomic status to biomarkers of inflammation is a new contribution to population-based prevention approaches to CVD risk reduction among elders.

"Rush Center of Excellence on Disparties in HIV and Aging (CEDHA)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the Rush Center of Excellence on Disparities in HIV and Aging (Rush CEDHA) is to provide an infrastructure to support collaborative, multidisciplinary epidemiologic research focused on understanding and eliminating racial disparities in the aging-related consequences of HIV. The proposed Center will integrate and centralize minority health and health disparities research into a single interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary enterprise. It has four Cores and three related research projects to support the goals of the Center. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the CEDHA as a whole. The Research Core will collect annual cognitive and motor function data, psychosocial risk factors, co-morbidities, and biospecimens in older adults (>50 years) with and without HIV infection, and compare them to existing data from HIV-uninfected persons age 65-90 matched on race, gender, and socioeconomic status. The data generated by this Core will be used to support two research projects and one pilot project focused on inflammation and immune senescence in HIV. Project 1 will collect MRI data and serum    inflammatory markers on subjects from the Research Core, and test hypotheses concerning the relationships among age, race, and inflammation in HIV. Project 2 will measure immune perturbations and markers of immune senescence in lymphocytes to estimate the age-associated acceleration in aging due to HIV, and test the hypothesis that racial differences in immune perturbations lead to early immune senescence in African Americans with HIV. Pilot project 1 will conduct a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to explore the safety and estimate the effect offish oil to modulate parameters of aging-related inflammation and immune senescence in HIV. The Research Training/Education Core will centralize education efforts in health disparities research and develop a research training component to mentor early career investigators interested in health disparities. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core will provide a wide range of educational programs to support outreach and recruitment of minorities into studies and disseminate research findings back to the communities experiencing the health disparities.              RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The rich resources generated by the Rush CEDHA will provide the research community with unparalleled

"Enhancing Project Talent: Early Life Impacts on Later Life Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 1960, the American Institutes for Research (AIR) initiated Project TALENT by collecting extensive data, including demographic information, cognitive measures, dispositional traits, and interests, from 440,000 high school students, their teachers, and their guidance counselors. In addition, follow-up surveys 1, 5, and 11 years after high school graduation added information about experiences such as postsecondary education, labor force participation, family formation, and military service. With its large, nationally representative sample of a cohort now in their sixties, longitudinal design, and extensive information on early life experiences, Project TALENT is uniquely suited to be the basis for a major longitudinal study of aging that can address research questions such as what characteristics predict health outcomes such as Alzheimer's disease and health disparities. AIR is currently designing this study, with plans for a 50-year follow-up in 2014. Designing the study requires increased analysis of the existing data by an expanded group of researchers. In its current format, with 843,000 records and 10,000 variables essentially unchanged since the 1970's, the data are difficult and time-consuming to access, and thus their use is often limited. We propose to modernize the data and documentation, bringing them up to the current standards of the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA). Doing so will restore the complete data set and allow for data to be easily accessed and input into any analysis format; enable documentation to be searchable at the variable level across data collections and data years; and fully integrate the data into the NACDA collection. To accomplish this task, staff from AIR and NACDA will collaborate, pairing AIR's in-depth knowledge of Project TALENT with NACDA's state-of-the-art archival expertise. Our plans include integration of Project TALENT into the ICPSR's automated HERMES system, which will allow for regular data updates to be efficiently implemented and for the standard content and format for documentation. Additionally, we will restructure the Project TALENT data files from a series of multiple files into a unified collection supported by an interface that allows users to make informed decisions about data extraction. Project TALENT data continue to be highly relevant today as a research source and analyses of existing data will provide critical information for planning the new follow-up; enhancing the data and documentation will greatly increase their availability to researchers, and will lay the groundwork for planned future releases of Project TALENT, including the addition of linked administrative data. The sheer breadth of Project TALENT insures that it will continue to offer new opportunities for original research on aging, most notably the opportunity to investigate questions about the relationship among physical health, cognitive functioning, socioeconomic, and demographic factors at different stages of life.        In 1960, the American Institutes of Research (AIR) collected extensive data on about 440,000 high school students in Project TALENT and conducted follow-up surveys 1, 5, and 11 years after graduation; with these participants now in their 60s, Project TALENT is uniquely suited to be the basis for a new longitudinal study of aging, and AIR is currently planning a 50-year follow-up study. AIR and the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA) propose to combine their expertise to modernize and archive Project TALENT data files and documentation to meet the demand for increased and easier access by researchers. These newly archived data will facilitate research not previously possible, and will play a key role in conducting necessary analyses to design the study that will transform Project TALENT into an invaluable resource for research on how cognitive, socioeconomic, and demographic factors interact with factors that moderate physical health outcomes, cognitive functioning such as Alzheimer's disease, and health disparities across the life course.

"A Transdisciplinary Approach to Engage Specialty Investigators in Aging Research   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""A Transdisciplinary Approach to Engage Specialty Investigators in Aging Research,"" will address the pressing need to develop research priorities and new investigators to address critical health care issues facing the nation's rapidly growing population of older adults. The Association of Subspecialty Professors (ASP) has previously held five similar conferences (on topics such as HIV and aging and acute kidney failure in elderly patients) and aims to extend this series with NIH funding supplemented and leveraged by private foundation support from the John A. Hartford Foundation. Under Aim 1, ASP will hold three research agenda setting meetings from 2012 through 2014 in the areas of solid organ transplantation in elderly patients, diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular (CV) complications in seniors, and wound healing and tissue regeneration in older adults. Each conference will also address the disparities in healthcare among ethnic and racial minorities in these areas. Planning committees and participants for each meeting will include senior and junior faculty in a wide variety of disciplines (e.g. internal medicine, surgery neurology, nursing, and interventional radiology), and representatives of relevant professional organizations as well as appropriate NIH Institutes and Centers. This diverse group will ensure that the conferences serve to bridge disciplines, fill bench-to-bedside gaps in knowledge, and inject key concepts in aging research including senescence, quality of life measures, and frailty into fields generally void of such considerations. Using the meetings outlined in Aim 1 as a vehicle, ASP will build on this work in Aim 2, to focus more broadly on raising the profile of geriatrics and gerontology in key disciplines by engaging with vital researchers in each specialty as well as rising junior faculty ""stars"" in the specialty. In Aim 3, ASP will focus on stimulating research application and fostering career development by engaging NIH IC contacts outside of NIA, publishing the conference proceedings in high impact specialty journals, and training junior scientists in the conduct of aging research through specific development strategies at each meeting. Narrative The Association of Subspecialty Professors' project, ""A Transdisciplinary Approach to Engage Specialty Investigators in Aging Research,"" focuses on improving the health care of America's rapidly aging population. The project will develop roadmaps to guide future research in three conditions disproportionately affecting elderly patients: organ transplantation; cardiovascular complications of diabetes; and would care and tissue regeneration. The project will also address how to overcome the health care disparities racial and ethnic minority populations confront in these areas. To provide a long-term platform for improving care, the project will stimulate continuing education programming and prepare junior researchers to enter life-long careers in studying aging and its interplay with chronic diseases.",A Transdisciplinary Approach to Engage Specialty Investigators in Aging Research,8328885,U13AG040938,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Awareness ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Dermatology ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunization ', ' Institutes ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Investments ', ' Acute Renal Insufficiency ', ' Acute Renal Failure ', ' Acute Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Acute Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims represent a systematic continuation of prior RCMAR efforts. Specifically the mission of the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) is to generate knowledge that will reduce health disparities and improve health. To fulfill this mission, MCUAAAR pursues twin goals of: (1) increasing the number of highly trained African American aging researchers; and, (2) including more elderly African American subjects in health disparities research. To achieve these two goals, the continuation application proposes to explore three specific aims: 1) To recruit and mentor 15 new junior scholars into the area of aging and health research; 2) To increase important research on health and health promotion among Older Adults of ethnic and racial populations, especially African Americans; and, 3) To extend research on the recruitment and retention of African American elders in health by utilizing the large MCUAAAR Participant Registry. Among other things, Aims 1 and 2 are motivated by the NIH-funded study (Ginther et al, 2011), which reported that grant applications from black scientists were 10 percentage points less likely to win grants than were applications from white investigators; in practical terms, this gap means that whites are about twice as likely as blacks to win approval. Aim 3 recognizes that a sophisticated social/behavioral approach is required to understand the growing mortality, disease and health disparities among older African Americans. Throughout their training, MCUAAAR scholars will have: unlimited access to the Participant Registry, a research pool of currently 1685 willing minority respondents built over nearly a decade following a Community Based Participatory Model. The significance of this project is directly rooted in three major factors: overcoming critical barriers, improving scientific knowledge, and advancing the field of aging research. The project innovativeness of MCUAAAR resides in three distinctive features: shifts in current paradigms, novel approaches, and refined concepts.	           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need for well-trained faculty of color devoted to the study and amelioration of significant health status and health service disparities is well-documented. The purpose of the MCUAAAR is to provide training for junior scholars to become independent NIH funded researchers, facilitate community outreach and community research participation, and contribute to reducing and the eventual amelioration of race and ethnic health disparities.",Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research,8374276,P30AG015281,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Work ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' ranpirnase ', ' Research Subjects ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Research Training ', ' Behavioral ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2012,553312,0.10096839670803708
"Health and Aging in Africa:  Longitudinal Studies of INDEPTH Communities     DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Over the last decades, countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have experienced a demographic and epidemiological transition with declines in mortality from infectious diseases and increases in the prevalence of non-communicable disease. Many adults in SSA are now surviving with chronic diseases whether they are communicable or non-communicable. While we have data resources to understand the challenges of aging in the context of high income countries, little is understood of the nature of aging in the SSA context. Our project aims to establish longitudinal surveys of health, aging, and well-being allowing estimation of the prevalence and incidence of major chronic conditions in 3 population-based health and demographic surveillance sites (HDSS) at different stages of health transitions (in South Africa, Ghana and Tanzania) in adults age 50 and over (n=12,000). Participants are surveyed in each year 2014 to 2017 with continuous mortality monitoring. Baseline surveys are introduced in one country per year, with South Africa in year 2, Ghana in year 3 and Tanzania in year 4. A 3 year follow up occurs in South Africa in year 5. Through intensive monitoring and follow up, migrants will be maintained in the cohort at very high levels. Our survey is comparable to that of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and sister surveys, yet is adapted to capture characteristics specific to SSA. With 4 subprojects on 1.physical and cognitive function, 2.cardiometabolic disorders, 3.HIV, and 4.economic well-being, our goal is to understand the determinants of health in the elderly and in turn find the consequences of health for productivity and well-being. Our specific aims are: 1. To establish three cohorts of 4,000 men and women aged 50 and over based on random stratified samples of the HDSS populations in the INDEPTH sites of Agincourt in South Africa, Navrongo in Ghana and Ifakara in Tanzania (n=12,000). A clinical substudy is conducted in a 10% subsample to look intensively at HIV and CVD. 2. To identify social, economic and biologic predictors of mortality, the incidence of disease (particularly cardiovascular disease and HIV) and changes in physical and cognitive function over three years. 3. To identify the effects of ill health on the economic well-being and productivity of the three cohorts. We aim to identify the ways in which behavioral and biologic risks are embedded in the social and policy context and are driven by social and economic conditions. Health policies, in the broadest sense, will need to rest on a strong evidence base and our study will provide valid and reliable assessments of phenotypic disorders and risk factors.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has experienced a demographic and epidemiological transition with declines in mortality from infectious diseases and increases in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases.

"Socio-economic status and heterogeneity in aging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic status and heterogeneity in aging As people get older there is increasing heterogeneity in health and in physical, mental and cognitive functioning, resulting in age peers becoming more and more dissimilar from each other. Research on the determinants of this heterogeneity is crucial as positive health trajectories are related to higher quality of life, longer independence and considerably lower medical and social care costs. The Whitehall II study on 10,308 British civil servants was set up in 1985 and has played a crucial role in shaping the research agenda on social inequalities in health. Over the last 22 years participants, now aged 55-79 years, have been followed up with medical examinations at 5-year intervals and with questionnaire surveys every second or third year. Thus, Whitehall II is now primed to address one of the major challenges of the new millennium; determinants of heterogeneity in health in ageing populations. NIA support has been crucial to the addition and exploitation of functioning data in the Whitehall II study. As the participants age, this application seeks continued NIA support for further analysis of the data collected so far and to collect two more phases of data over the next 5 years. This support will enable us to address three overall aims. 1) Social inequalities in chronic diseases, mortality and functioning: To examine whether relative and absolute social inequalities in chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes) and mortality increase with age and to estimate the importance of biological, behavioral and psychosocial explanations of these inequalities. To examine the contribution of repeated measures of risk factors to contemporaneous, trajectory and accumulated risk models. To determine whether the consequences of disease on functioning differs or are moderated by socioeconomic status. 2) Cognitive changes in early old age: determinants and consequences: To examine the socioeconomic, vascular and behavioral determinants of heterogeneity in cognitive aging, starting in midlife, and to assess the consequences of cognitive decline on physical, social and mental functioning and mortality. 3) Social participation: impact on health and functioning in early old age: To examine the socioeconomic and gender patterning of social participation trajectories over the adult life course. To examine the effects of social participation on functioning and chronic disease and to address the issues of reverse causation and confounding in the association between social participation and health. The relevance of our research is tied in with continuing increase in life expectancy and the need to identify potentially modifiable risk factors to improve overall health and reduce social inequalities in the health of older populations. Aging trajectories appear to diverge fairly early on and our data on a multitude of risk factors and health measures on individuals from early mid-life to old age are an important resource to study the determinants of heterogeneity in aging trajectories. Relevance  Whitehall II's first major achievement was to put the social gradient in health high on  the research agenda of the scientific community. Testimonies to the success of that  early pioneering work are replica studies in a number of countries and research  programs to investigate the pathways from social position to health in every continent.  Following recognition by the scientific community, the next hurdle was to bring the  social gradient to the attention of policy makers. Here the effort of Professor Sir  Michael Marmot has brought outstanding success culminating in Sir Michael being  asked to chair the ongoing WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health.  Now, twenty two from its inception, Whitehall II is primed to address one of the major  challenges of the new millennium; disparities in health and functioning in an ageing  population. Research in this domain is crucial as positive health trajectories are related  to higher quality of life, longer independence and considerably lower medical and  social care costs.",Socio-economic

"Enhancing Project Talent: Early Life Impacts on Later Life Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 1960, the American Institutes for Research (AIR) initiated Project TALENT by collecting extensive data, including demographic information, cognitive measures, dispositional traits, and interests, from 440,000 high school students, their teachers, and their guidance counselors. In addition, follow-up surveys 1, 5, and 11 years after high school graduation added information about experiences such as postsecondary education, labor force participation, family formation, and military service. With its large, nationally representative sample of a cohort now in their sixties, longitudinal design, and extensive information on early life experiences, Project TALENT is uniquely suited to be the basis for a major longitudinal study of aging that can address research questions such as what characteristics predict health outcomes such as Alzheimer's disease and health disparities. AIR is currently designing this study, with plans for a 50-year follow-up in 2014. Designing the study requires increased analysis of the existing data by an expanded group of researchers. In its current format, with 843,000 records and 10,000 variables essentially unchanged since the 1970's, the data are difficult and time-consuming to access, and thus their use is often limited. We propose to modernize the data and documentation, bringing them up to the current standards of the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA). Doing so will restore the complete data set and allow for data to be easily accessed and input into any analysis format; enable documentation to be searchable at the variable level across data collections and data years; and fully integrate the data into the NACDA collection. To accomplish this task, staff from AIR and NACDA will collaborate, pairing AIR's in-depth knowledge of Project TALENT with NACDA's state-of-the-art archival expertise. Our plans include integration of Project TALENT into the ICPSR's automated HERMES system, which will allow for regular data updates to be efficiently implemented and for the standard content and format for documentation. Additionally, we will restructure the Project TALENT data files from a series of multiple files into a unified collection supported by an interface that allows users to make informed decisions about data extraction. Project TALENT data continue to be highly relevant today as a research source and analyses of existing data will provide critical information for planning the new follow-up; enhancing the data and documentation will greatly increase their availability to researchers, and will lay the groundwork for planned future releases of Project TALENT, including the addition of linked administrative data. The sheer breadth of Project TALENT insures that it will continue to offer new opportunities for original research on aging, most notably the opportunity to investigate questions about the relationship among physical health, cognitive functioning, socioeconomic, and demographic factors at different stages of life.        In 1960, the American Institutes of Research (AIR) collected extensive data on about 440,000 high school students in Project TALENT and conducted follow-up surveys 1, 5, and 11 years after graduation; with these participants now in their 60s, Project TALENT is uniquely suited to be the basis for a new longitudinal study of aging, and AIR is currently planning a 50-year follow-up study. AIR and the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA) propose to combine their expertise to modernize and archive Project TALENT data files and documentation to meet the demand for increased and easier access by researchers. These newly archived data will facilitate research not previously possible, and will play a key role in conducting necessary analyses to design the study that will transform Project TALENT into an invaluable resource for research on how cognitive, socioeconomic, and demographic factors interact with factors that moderate physical health outcomes, cognitive functioning such as Alzheimer's disease, and health disparities across the life course.

"Effect of Genetic, Individual & Neighborhood Factors on Telomere Length    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This training grant is being sought by a PhD student entering the dissertation phase of her degree in Epidemiology. The candidate aspires to become a leading independent scientist in the field of aging research. She will devote 100% of her time to this research for the duration of her PhD. Her hands-on training during her dissertation phase, coupled with carefully selected courses, are designed to make her expert in the use of advanced statistical methods to define associations between individual and neighborhood factors, genetic variants, and telomere length. This dual training approach will prepare her for future studies investigating molecular markers associated with aging and the role neighborhood environment and genetics play in health disparities and aging. Throughout this award, she will be mentored by senior experts in behavior, geospatial analyses, aging outcomes, genetics, molecular markers and biostatistics.  The process of cellular aging, as measured by telomere length, likely occurs through the complex interactions of multiple factors over the lifespan. The goal of the research proposed here is to better explain the complex, multifactorial nature of cellular aging using a surrogate biomarker, telomere length. We will undertake a multilevel statistical approach that includes identifying individual-level (Aim 1) and neighborhood- level factors (Aim 2) that affect telomere length and the relationship between telomere genetic variants and telomere length (Aim 3), in an existing multi-ethnic longitudinal cohort of older men. Associations have been reported between telomere length and genetic variants, individual risk behaviors (smoking, body mass index) and sociodemographic variables (an individual's race, sex, social status). However, neighborhood level factors (social isolation, structural decline, violence, etc) represent an important consideration for aging studies since they have been associated with age-related disease and are particularly relevant for older adults, who may live in unfavorable neighborhoods for long time periods. This is the first study to account for the collective effects of multiple factors on telomere length. Using linear regression and backward regression, the applicant will model baseline telomere length (defined by T/S ratio) as a continuous variable, with individual level measures, and select neighborhood factors entered separately as independent variables, using a p-value of 0.20 as the threshold for inclusion. Analyses will be repeated stratifying by race. Clustering and multicollinearity will be considered when assessing the effect of neighborhood variables on telomere length. In order to test the effects of genetic haplotypes in the neighborhood context, we will use multivariable analysis to model telomere length and a vector of covariates identified in Aims 1 and 2. Studies of this nature are critical if genes or individual risk factors affect telomere length more profoundly in certain neighborhood settings. This study will build the foundations of a conceptual model that can be used as the basis for future studies on aging.        The association between genetic variants and telomere length may depend on individual and neighborhood risk factors. Using an interdisciplinary, multi-level statistical approach, this research will better explain the complex, multifactorial nature of cellular aging(measured here by telomere length). This study will help identify health disparities in aging and can serve as a conceptual model for future aging research.

"Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The foundation of this revised competitive resubmission of the Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death (El) program project is the discovery in 2004 that disparities in health and mortality across the wards of the major US cities in 1900 were not only far greater (on the order of 10-to-1) than recognized, but that 84% of the disparities between the worst and best wards had diminished by 1950. When the analysis was pushed back into the 19th century, it was discovered that young adult death rates in the 17 largest cities of 1860, when analyzed longitudinally, were far higher than previously revealed by period life tables. Union Army (UA) recruits from these cities who survived the Civil War had die off rates so high that their experience is characterized by life tables with eo of about 28.6 years, which is about 17.7 years less than life expectancy in rural areas. The explanation of the disparity within and across cities, as well as across rural areas, and the social, economic, and biodemographic factors that lead to the amelioration of these disparities between 1830 and 1950 requires the creation of a data set with ecological variables capable of explaining the process. The collection and management of these data account for three-fourths of the cost of this program project. Four analytical projects initiate the analysis of the new data: Project 1 will analyze how the socioeconomic and health status of UA soldiers and veterans interacted with each other over the life course, stressing interactions across different sub-populations and times. Project 2 focuses on those veterans who lived to be age 95 or older (the last 2% of the cohort) comparing their aging processes with those born just before World War I and investigating whether the effects of earlier life environmental stress persist even to very old ages. Project 3 analyses the impact of exposure to severe within urban environments over different spans of the life course on the process of aging. Project 4 deals with the differences across urban and rural areas in the process of aging. RELEVANCE: This project bears on the explanation for the marked decline in US age-specific morbidity and mortality rates over the 20th century. It assesses the relative contribution of the decrease in disparities in environmental conditions to long-term improvement in health and longevity in the US and other rich nations and in the Third World. It also provides a basis for forecasting the impact of life-cycle improvements in health experienced by parents and grandparents of baby-boom and baby-dearth generations on the health of their progeny and some likely changes in the process of aging in the first half of the 21st century.","Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death",8424992,P01AG010120,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Baby Booms ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Cities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Tables ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Parents ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' War ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Death Rate ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Exposure to ', ' grandparent ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Soldier ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' social ', ' ward ', ' Great War ', ' First World War ', ' 1st World War ', ' World War I ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2013,2392308,0.09136335581566958
"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for competitive funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for the period 2010 - 2014. ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) in the United States, and recruited 12,100 men and women aged 50 and above who were representative of the older population of England. ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with half of the funding coming from a consortium of UK Government Departments. This renewal request is to fund two waves of data collection - wave 5 (2010/11) and wave 6 (2012/13) - and associated analyses. The central objective is to provide data necessary for the exploration of the unfolding dynamic relationships between health and functioning, economic position, social participation/networks and well-being, as people plan for, move into and progress beyond retirement. ELSA is a multidisciplinary study, involving the collection of economic, epidemiological, health, social, psychological, physiological and genetic data. The phase of data collection planned in this application will greatly increase the potential for longitudinal analyses so as to examine causal process. The scientific agenda of this application is focused on eight broad research topics that are important scientifically while also being relevant to policy. These are the nature and timing of retirement and post retirement labour market activity; the determinants of economic well-being in older age; cognitive functioning and its impact on decision making among older people; disability and the compression of morbidity; economic, social and health inequalities in an ageing population; social participation and social productivity at older ages; the interaction between genetic, biological, and psychosocial determinants of health and mortality; and comparisons of trajectories of health, economic position and well-being at older ages in England and the USA. The specific objectives of this proposal include the following: 1. Design the survey instruments for further waves of data collection, building on the existing data and maximizing comparability with other international studies, such as HRS and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). 2. Recruit a new cohort of respondents aged 50-53, at wave 5, in order to maintain cross-sectional representativeness and to study social and cross-cohort trends. 3. Interview approximately 8,400 respondents at wave 5 and 7400 respondents at wave 6. 4. Collect biomedical and physical performance data from respondents at wave 6. 5. Provide seven waves of well-documented panel data to the scientific and policy research community. 6. Carry out analyses of the ELSA data relevant to the core research themes. Aging is a major concern to public health, and longitudinal data from a large sample of aging men and women helps us understand the evolution of disability, illness and healthy aging. The multidisciplinary English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collects information about the interrelationships between health and disability, economic position, social participation, cognitive function and well-being that is relevant both to policy and scientific agendas. International comparisons between the dynamics of aging in the US, UK and other countries allow institutional and cultural influences to be examined, providing opportunities for testing the impact of policies and organisational structures.",English Longitudinal Study of Ageing,8726236,R01AG017644,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Attitude ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economic Models ', ' Economics ', ' England ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Europe ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Retirement Benefits ', ' Pensions ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Questionnaire Designs ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Method ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Genetic ', ' Sister ', ' Nature ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Outcome Study ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' life history ', ' cohort ', ' expectation ', ' social inequality ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Policy Research ', ' Collection ', ' Older Population ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' health economics ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' healthy aging ', ' health inequalities ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,R01,2013,107760,0.0586387569767132
"Energetics, Disparities, & Lifespan: A unified hypothesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The evolution and ontogeny of lifespan at the species and individual level, the energetics of the organism in its environment, the storage of metabolizable energy as body fat, and socioeconomic disparities within populations all seem intricately related and yet the nature of these interrelations is poorly understood. Indeed questions as fundamental as why we age remain open and subsidiary questions such as why caloric restriction leads to increased lifespan and why lower socioeconomic status is related to obesity in developed countries also remain unanswered. Herein, we propose a unified model informed by evolutionary thinking about life strategies which connects these phenomena. In this model, aging or more precisely senescence is not something that passively happens to us as the result of environmental insults or from metabolizing fuel, but is something we do. That is, mortality rate or the rate of aging is seen as (partially) internally regulable phenomenon much like the control of body temperature in homeotherms in which the regulated rate is responsive to perceptions about the energetic state of the environment. From this perspective, it is perceptions of the energetic security of the environment that are a key factor in linking these phenomena. We elaborate this theory herein and from it derive seven specific hypotheses, each of which is testable in a different experiment using model organisms. We have assembled a team of the world's leading researchers to conduct these seven experiments and then to conduct follow-up work to study both a priori specified potential causal mechanisms involving internal clock regulation and also to conduct exploratory work to identify new potential mechanisms. Outcomes from this work will have profound implications for our understanding of the nature of aging, of health disparities, and of obesity.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Maximizing quality of life for citizens from all social strata and at all ages requires an understanding of the factors that lead to disparities in health, to differences in body fat levels, and to healthier aging in our increasingly older population.

"Geographic Variation in Cardiovascular Inflammation in Middle-aged & Elderly Popu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the US, and a significant source of racial and socioeconomic disparities in morbidity among aging populations. Chronic inflammation is thought to underlie the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and the development of cardiovascular disease. There are racial and socioeconomic disparities in biomarkers of cardiovascular inflammation that increase across middle and older age, particularly among women. These disparities are not completely explained by traditional risk factors at the individual level, including behavioral risk factors. Area-level socioeconomic status may influence the incidence of cardiovascular disease by promoting inflammation. The candidate seeks training to investigate the role of metropolitan area and neighborhood level social factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular inflammation among aging populations. The proposed research has a novel focus on geographic social determinants of pre-disease risk markers of inflammation. The candidate is trained in Internal Medicine (MD) and Social Epidemiology (SD). The candidate brings experience evaluating social exposures at the individual level among middle-aged and elder adults. Over five years, the candidate will acquire training in (1) physiology and regulation of cardiovascular inflammatory pathways, (2) analytic techniques to integrate geographic data on social factors with biologic data in epidemiologic research, and (3) leadership in interdisciplinary research in diverse and aging populations. This training provides preparation for the candidate's long-term career goal to investigate area-level socioeconomic factors that contribute to pre-disease cardiovascular risk factors in diverse and aging populations. The proposed training program will be mentored by Dr. Lisa Berkman (primary mentor. Social Epidemiologist, social influences on aging, interdisciplinary epidemiology research) and Dr. Paul Ridker (Cardiologist, cardiovascular inflammation in atherosclerosis, cardiac event risk prediction among women). A team of advisors will (1) provide training in geographic analysis, and (2) support working with the two study populations. The proposed research will be conducted in the (1) Women's Health Study (WHS) and the (2) Jackson Heart Study (JHS). Publications stemming from these investigations will enhance scientific understandings of geographic variation in cardiovascular disease risks among middle-aged and elder populations. RELEVANCE: Investigators who are trained to investigate connections between social factors and biomarkers of disease risk are needed to guide social and behavioral interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiovascular disease in diverse and aging populations. Connecting geographic level socioeconomic status to biomarkers of inflammation is a new contribution to population-based prevention approaches to CVD risk reduction among elders.

"USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Advances in medicine and technology are providing for longer and healthier lives today. American families have increasingly been asked to take responsibility for their own health and financial outcomes: how long to work, how much to save, when to claim Social Security and pension benefits, which health plans to choose, and how to allocate and manage their assets. Navigating these complex choices may be particularly difficult for minority elderly, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Indeed, health indicators have demonstrated little improvement in health disparities between different racial and ethnic populations over the past decade, according to analyses in Healthy People 2010. Evidence also suggests that minority households tend to be excluded from or participate only on the margins of the financial mainstream. To this end we propose to establish a RCMAR at USC that will develop an infrastructure to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1. Provide leadership, organizational, communication and evaluation systems to achieve the overarching goal of supporting high-quality and enduring research careers in the health and economic challenges of minority elderly; 2. Support pilot study solicitation and selection process to ensure the selection of scientifically rigorous and fundable pilot projects and enhancement of the diversity of researchers; 3. Support pilot-funded investigators through achievement of pilot studies goals and award of an independent grant by multidisciplinary mentoring and training in the methods and tools of economics, computer science, medicine, and social work; 4. Analyze large longitudinal survey data sets and medical claims data on the health, medical care and expenditures, economic status, and financial decisions of diverse elderly populations in order to generate interventions that will address health and economic disparities; 5. Track and evaluate the successes of pilot investigators and data analysis and improve the infrastructure support in accordance with evaluation findings. This proposed RCMAR is a collaboration between USC and RAND that utilizes the resources of USC's Roybal Center on Health Policy Simulation, Roybal Institute on Aging, Alzheimer Disease Research Center, and RAND's Roybal Center for Financial Decision making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the health and economics issues associated with the aging process are of such magnitude and complexity that they cannot be approached from the vantage point of any single discipline alone. With the National Institute on Aging's Priority Area for RCMAR Centers comes a pressing need to build infrastructure that will bring a multidisciplinary approach to the health and economic challenges of minority elderly and have a long-lasting effect on research in this area.",USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR),8535592,P30AG043073,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Household ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Retirement Benefits ', ' Pensions ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Savings ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' American ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' simulation ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Process ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' financial decision making ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,P30,2013,662286,0.0991894194982518
"Conference Series on Aging in the Americas: United States and Mexico Abstract  The proposed new installments of the conference series on aging in the Americas (2012-2014) will focus on  the state of readiness for addressing the needs of Latino elders and for sustaining their health and well-being.  The most poignant example is the Mexico-U.S. contrast as these societies are contending with multiple  demands for public use of scarce resources and have overlapping, interdependent populations and family  networks transcending both nations.  Thirty papers and six keynote speakers from sociology, psychology, social policy, medicine, economics,  gerontology, demography, epidemiology, and community health will 1) discuss the impact of changing  demographics on community capacity for successful aging, including health, housing, and food security; 2)  create a strategic framework for future transnational comparative research on Hispanics in the U.S. and  Mexico, including issue identification and the available data resources for advancing a high quality research  menu on this fundamental issue; and 3) develop a set of goals for advancing the healthy aging in the Mexicanorigin  population from a bi-national perspective. Collectively, the research will provide new knowledge on the  health consequences of emerging trends in the Americas for Hispanic communities and will inform new  strategic initiatives to adequately respond to the accelerating demands of aging populations. Project Narrative  The coming nexus of aging and diversity faced by the United States will require a greater level of scrutiny and  analysis if we are to provide policy solutions to aging and health care in the United States and, by example, in  Mexico and throughout Latin America. A conference focusing specifically on increasing scholarly Latino  research into the aging process from a bi-national, interdisciplinary, and comparative perspective is vital. The  next installments of the Conference Series on Aging in the Americas will make a substantive contribution to the  knowledge base, filling a significant vacuum of information on this under-studied but increasingly prominent  population and the consensus objectives will inform the NIH Healthy People 2020.",Conference Series on Aging in the Americas: United States and Mexico,8530127,R13AG029767,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Budgets ', ' Communities ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Demography ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Latin America ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Peer Review ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Scholarship ', ' Social Policies ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Societies ', ' Sociology ', ' Solutions ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vacuum ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Mexican ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Letters ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Transcend ', ' experience ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Population Research ', ' Research Training ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Community Health ', ' Behavioral ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' food security ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' comparative ', ' demographics ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' healthy aging ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R13,2013,40000,0.10915487011398275
"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for competitive funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for the period 2010 - 2014. ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) in the United States, and recruited 12,100 men and women aged 50 and above who were representative of the older population of England. ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with half of the funding coming from a consortium of UK Government Departments. This renewal request is to fund two waves of data collection - wave 5 (2010/11) and wave 6 (2012/13) - and associated analyses. The central objective is to provide data necessary for the exploration of the unfolding dynamic relationships between health and functioning, economic position, social participation/networks and well-being, as people plan for, move into and progress beyond retirement. ELSA is a multidisciplinary study, involving the collection of economic, epidemiological, health, social, psychological, physiological and genetic data. The phase of data collection planned in this application will greatly increase the potential for longitudinal analyses so as to examine causal process.  The scientific agenda of this application is focused on eight broad research topics that are important scientifically while also being relevant to policy. These are the nature and timing of retirement and post retirement labour market activity; the determinants of economic well-being in older age; cognitive functioning and its impact on decision making among older people; disability and the compression of morbidity; economic, social and health inequalities in an ageing population; social participation and social productivity at older ages; the interaction between genetic, biological, and psychosocial determinants of health and mortality; and comparisons of trajectories of health, economic position and well-being at older ages in England and the USA.  The specific objectives of this proposal include the following: 1. Design the survey instruments for further waves of data collection, building on the existing data and  maximizing comparability with other international studies, such as HRS and the Survey of Health, Ageing  and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). 2. Recruit a new cohort of respondents aged 50-53, at wave 5, in order to maintain cross-sectional  representativeness and to study social and cross-cohort trends. 3. Interview approximately 8,400 respondents at wave 5 and 7400 respondents at wave 6. 4. Collect biomedical and physical performance data from respondents at wave 6. 5. Provide seven waves of well-documented panel data to the scientific and policy research community. 6. Carry out analyses of the ELSA data relevant to the core research themes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aging is a major concern to public health, and longitudinal data from a large sample of aging men and women helps us understand the evolution of disability, illness and healthy aging. The multidisciplinary English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collects information about the interrelationships between health and disability, economic position, social participation, cognitive function and well-being that is relevant both to policy and scientific agendas. International comparisons between the dynamics of aging in the US, UK and other countries allow institutional and cultural influences to be examined, providing opportunities for testing the impact of policies and organisational structures.

"A Transdisciplinary Approach to Engage Specialty Investigators in Aging Research   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""A Transdisciplinary Approach to Engage Specialty Investigators in Aging Research,"" will address the pressing need to develop research priorities and new investigators to address critical health care issues facing the nation's rapidly growing population of older adults. The Association of Subspecialty Professors (ASP) has previously held five similar conferences (on topics such as HIV and aging and acute kidney failure in elderly patients) and aims to extend this series with NIH funding supplemented and leveraged by private foundation support from the John A. Hartford Foundation. Under Aim 1, ASP will hold three research agenda setting meetings from 2012 through 2014 in the areas of solid organ transplantation in elderly patients, diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular (CV) complications in seniors, and wound healing and tissue regeneration in older adults. Each conference will also address the disparities in healthcare among ethnic and racial minorities in these areas. Planning committees and participants for each meeting will include senior and junior faculty in a wide variety of disciplines (e.g. internal medicine, surgery neurology, nursing, and interventional radiology), and representatives of relevant professional organizations as well as appropriate NIH Institutes and Centers. This diverse group will ensure that the conferences serve to bridge disciplines, fill bench-to-bedside gaps in knowledge, and inject key concepts in aging research including senescence, quality of life measures, and frailty into fields generally void of such considerations. Using the meetings outlined in Aim 1 as a vehicle, ASP will build on this work in Aim 2, to focus more broadly on raising the profile of geriatrics and gerontology in key disciplines by engaging with vital researchers in each specialty as well as rising junior faculty ""stars"" in the specialty. In Aim 3, ASP will focus on stimulating research application and fostering career development by engaging NIH IC contacts outside of NIA, publishing the conference proceedings in high impact specialty journals, and training junior scientists in the conduct of aging research through specific development strategies at each meeting. Narrative The Association of Subspecialty Professors' project, ""A Transdisciplinary Approach to Engage Specialty Investigators in Aging Research,"" focuses on improving the health care of America's rapidly aging population. The project will develop roadmaps to guide future research in three conditions disproportionately affecting elderly patients: organ transplantation; cardiovascular complications of diabetes; and would care and tissue regeneration. The project will also address how to overcome the health care disparities racial and ethnic minority populations confront in these areas. To provide a long-term platform for improving care, the project will stimulate continuing education programming and prepare junior researchers to enter life-long careers in studying aging and its interplay with chronic diseases.",A Transdisciplinary Approach to Engage Specialty Investigators in Aging Research,8508786,U13AG040938,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Awareness ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Dermatology ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunization ', ' Institutes ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Investments ', ' Acute Renal Insufficiency ', ' Acute Renal Failure ', ' Acute Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Acute Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims represent a systematic continuation of prior RCMAR efforts. Specifically the mission of the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) is to generate knowledge that will reduce health disparities and improve health. To fulfill this mission, MCUAAAR pursues twin goals of: (1) increasing the number of highly trained African American aging researchers; and, (2) including more elderly African American subjects in health disparities research. To achieve these two goals, the continuation application proposes to explore three specific aims: 1) To recruit and mentor 15 new junior scholars into the area of aging and health research; 2) To increase important research on health and health promotion among Older Adults of ethnic and racial populations, especially African Americans; and, 3) To extend research on the recruitment and retention of African American elders in health by utilizing the large MCUAAAR Participant Registry. Among other things, Aims 1 and 2 are motivated by the NIH-funded study (Ginther et al, 2011), which reported that grant applications from black scientists were 10 percentage points less likely to win grants than were applications from white investigators; in practical terms, this gap means that whites are about twice as likely as blacks to win approval. Aim 3 recognizes that a sophisticated social/behavioral approach is required to understand the growing mortality, disease and health disparities among older African Americans. Throughout their training, MCUAAAR scholars will have: unlimited access to the Participant Registry, a research pool of currently 1685 willing minority respondents built over nearly a decade following a Community Based Participatory Model. The significance of this project is directly rooted in three major factors: overcoming critical barriers, improving scientific knowledge, and advancing the field of aging research. The project innovativeness of MCUAAAR resides in three distinctive features: shifts in current paradigms, novel approaches, and refined concepts.	           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need for well-trained faculty of color devoted to the study and amelioration of significant health status and health service disparities is well-documented. The purpose of the MCUAAAR is to provide training for junior scholars to become independent NIH funded researchers, facilitate community outreach and community research participation, and contribute to reducing and the eventual amelioration of race and ethnic health disparities.",Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research,8535587,P30AG015281,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Work ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' ranpirnase ', ' Research Subjects ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Research Training ', ' Behavioral ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2013,826225,0.10096839670803708

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims represent a systematic continuation of prior RCMAR efforts. Specifically the mission of the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) is to generate knowledge that will reduce health disparities and improve health. To fulfill this mission, MCUAAAR pursues twin goals of: (1) increasing the number of highly trained African American aging researchers; and, (2) including more elderly African American subjects in health disparities research. To achieve these two goals, the continuation application proposes to explore three specific aims: 1) To recruit and mentor 15 new junior scholars into the area of aging and health research; 2) To increase important research on health and health promotion among Older Adults of ethnic and racial populations, especially African Americans; and, 3) To extend research on the recruitment and retention of African American elders in health by utilizing the large MCUAAAR Participant Registry. Among other things, Aims 1 and 2 are motivated by the NIH-funded study (Ginther et al, 2011), which reported that grant applications from black scientists were 10 percentage points less likely to win grants than were applications from white investigators; in practical terms, this gap means that whites are about twice as likely as blacks to win approval. Aim 3 recognizes that a sophisticated social/behavioral approach is required to understand the growing mortality, disease and health disparities among older African Americans. Throughout their training, MCUAAAR scholars will have: unlimited access to the Participant Registry, a research pool of currently 1685 willing minority respondents built over nearly a decade following a Community Based Participatory Model. The significance of this project is directly rooted in three major factors: overcoming critical barriers, improving scientific knowledge, and advancing the field of aging research.

"Rush Center of Excellence on Disparties in HIV and Aging (CEDHA)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the Rush Center of Excellence on Disparities in HIV and Aging (Rush CEDHA) is to provide an infrastructure to support collaborative, multidisciplinary epidemiologic research focused on understanding and eliminating racial disparities in the aging-related consequences of HIV. The proposed Center will integrate and centralize minority health and health disparities research into a single interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary enterprise. It has four Cores and three related research projects to support the goals of the Center. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the CEDHA as a whole. The Research Core will collect annual cognitive and motor function data, psychosocial risk factors, co-morbidities, and biospecimens in older adults (>50 years) with and without HIV infection, and compare them to existing data from HIV-uninfected persons age 65-90 matched on race, gender, and socioeconomic status. The data generated by this Core will be used to support two research projects and one pilot project focused on inflammation and immune senescence in HIV. Project 1 will collect MRI data and serum    inflammatory markers on subjects from the Research Core, and test hypotheses concerning the relationships among age, race, and inflammation in HIV. Project 2 will measure immune perturbations and markers of immune senescence in lymphocytes to estimate the age-associated acceleration in aging due to HIV, and test the hypothesis that racial differences in immune perturbations lead to early immune senescence in African Americans with HIV. Pilot project 1 will conduct a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to explore the safety and estimate the effect offish oil to modulate parameters of aging-related inflammation and immune senescence in HIV. The Research Training/Education Core will centralize education efforts in health disparities research and develop a research training component to mentor early career investigators interested in health disparities. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core will provide a wide range of educational programs to support outreach and recruitment of minorities into studies and disseminate research findings back to the communities experiencing the health disparities.              RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The rich resources generated by the Rush CEDHA will provide the research community with unparalleled opportunities to conduct studies that are essential to combat the pervasive health disparities between older African Americans and whites infected with HIV, a large and growing public health

"Costa P01Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging  OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - Project Summary/Abstract Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging This program project is a competitive continuation of Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death. Since its inception in 1991, EI has made many discoveries about the longitudinal determinants of retirement and of chronic disease and death at older ages by studying aging processes among Union Army veterans of the US Civil War, a group that mostly reached age 65 between 1885 and 1912. Among these discoveries are "" health at older ages, particularly for African-Americans, was worse than previously thought; "" retirement responsiveness to income transfers was greater than expected; "" social networks affected not just behavior but also health; and, "" stressful events in early life and at young adult ages reduced longevity, but extreme stress after age 30 left  a more robust population. These discoveries were possible because of the creation of longitudinal data sets that follow more than 67,000 Union Army recruits from military service back to childhood and forward to death and contain about 15,000 observations per person. This competitive continuation will take the next step by examining the inter- generational determinants of later longevity and socioeconomic status. The overarching purpose of this continuation is to gain a more precise understanding of 1) how inter- generational processes affect aging and longevity and 2) the mechanisms through which parents transmit socioeconomic status and longevity to their children. Data collected for this continuation will support the research aims outlined in this proposal and will also be made publicly available. We propose two cores and three new scientific projects, which will create intergenerational databases from Early Indicators data: Project #1: Intergenerational Processes and Aging of White Americans Project #2: Intergenerational Processes and Aging of African-Americans Project #3: Intergenerational Processes and Aging in Multiple Generations Core A (Administrative) and B (Data Development) will support data collection, research, and dissemination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the determinants of a long and healthy life has both scientific and policy implications. It can provide insights into future longevity and health trends; into the ages at which health and human capital investments may be most effective; and into ways that intergenerational factors may lead to the persistence of inequality in longevity, health, and socioeconomic status by race.            ","Costa P01Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging",8740080,P01AG010120,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Attitude ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Generation Effect ', ' Cohort Effect ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Investments ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Experience ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Printing ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisoner ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Retirement ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' Shock ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' War ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Social Network ', ' Left ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' residence ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Genetic ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Distant ', ' Soldier ', ' Services ', ' environmental stressor ', ' intergenerational ', ' family structure ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' human capital ', ' dissemination research ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' user-friendly ', ' public health relevance ', ' health inequalities ', ' policy implication ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2014,1898579,0.13178243122553399
"Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research: This project will create five different one-day conferences on current NIA initiatives that are relevant to minority aging research. The goal of the proposed conference series is to increase the quality, quantity, and relevance to communities of color of NIA-fundable research by providing both junior and senior researchers with new knowledge and greater interest in these emerging issues as they apply to minority elderly. This is significant because the number and proportion of the U.S. older population from racial and ethnic minority communities is growing rapidly: minorities will increase from 20% to over 40% of the older population between 2010 and 2050. Protecting and improving the health of these elderly requires a highly skilled research workforce with interests and capabilities in this area to produce new and useful knowledge. Yet the number and success of minority researchers funded by NIH is insufficient. The NIA's Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) program works to mentor and train junior faculty who conduct research on minority aging to strengthen the next generation of NIA-funded ethnic and racial minority researchers. The conferences will focus on: Cognitive health disparities research and national policy, Use of well-being measures in minority aging research and policy analyses, Stigma in minority aging research, Mutability and reversibility of risk factors across diverse populations, and Concepts and measures of stress and resilience for minority aging research. Each will feature leading scholars on the topic, top scholars on minority aging, and representatives from multiple NIA-funded centers and networks. The programs will disseminate the state of the art on the topic, inform researchers on how existing research needs to be modified or expanded to be more valid and relevant for minority elders, and provide tools that can be used by researchers to further develop the fields in research with minority elders. The conferences will be held as preconferences to the Gerontological Society of America (GSA) annual scientific meetings. There will be at least 50 participants at each conference and the majority will be minorities and/or women. The planning committee will be compromised of the confirmed keynote speakers who are leaders in the field, researchers from RCMAR sites with expertise in the topic, and members of other NIA-funded networks. The executive committee will be the RCMAR directors group. The project is innovative in the topics covered, the research networks involved, and the synergy with GSA. Program evaluation includes a process evaluation, a retrospective pre/post knowledge and confidence survey, and four-month follow-up survey on conference impacts. The lead investigators are national leaders in minority aging and gerontological education who have successfully led 11 previous GSA preconferences that reached over 600 researchers. This proposal is a renewal of the previous successful series with new topics but similar objectives of improving the knowledge and interest in emerging issues supported by NIA among RCMAR Scholars and faculty as well as among others with research agendas in minority aging and related issues; and raising awareness of how minority aging issues intersect these priority topics to promote research in the cutting edge issues.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older adults from racial and ethnic minorities communities often experience health risks and respond to health interventions differently than non-Hispanic whites. Understanding how to maximize the health of all older adults requires researchers who are knowledgeable about the theories, methods, and existing science relevant to minority elders. This conference series will educate researchers about the state of the art in emerging areas of NIA-funded research critical to population health and provide them with skills and motivation to expand that research in minority communities, increasing its relevance to the groups that will soon comprise 40% of the older adult population.            ",Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research,8720603,R13AG023033,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' journal article ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stream ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' success ', ' Distance Learning ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Committee Members ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' stress resilience ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' biodemography ', ' population health ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Education Module ', ' Learning Module ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R13,2014,50000,0.08785054622227782
"Advancing aging research through development of minority gerontologists     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of establishing the Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR) program at Howard University (HUADAR) is to identify a group of bright minority students from MSTEM disciplines early during their undergraduate years and then through extensive mentoring and training prepare them to successfully compete for graduate studies and other professional careers. By making them familiar with aging research early in their career, this cadre of minority researchers could be made squarely interested about building a career on geriatrics and gerontology. The Rationales for developing an HUADAR program is quite justifiable, for more than a century Howard University is engaged in training underrepresented minority students. About 97% of Howard's mentees are African Americans and National Science Foundation's (NSF) recent ranking put Howard University as the top producer of bachelor's degree recipients who subsequently earned science and engineering doctoral degrees nationally from top-tier research universities. Moreover, with an aggressive recruitment effort, Howard University successfully recruited several faculty members in MSTEM areas who are maintaining an active research programs on various aspects of aging and age related disorders. Therefore, Howard University has the ideal environment to identify a cadre of talented minority scientists early during their undergraduate years and it has the required resources to provide them with a foundation of knowledge and research skills through mentoring so that these students will excel in the interdisciplinary field of gerontology. Trainee compositio for HUADAR program will include 100% underrepresented minorities. Approximately 7,000 undergraduate students enroll at Howard in 29 undergraduate departments and programs, approximately 97% of enrollees are African American and 67% are women. Furthermore, 20% (or 1,400) major in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering and Allied Health with greater than 80% declaring medicine as their career goal. We plan to recruit five students from MSTEM disciplines each year by selecting them early at the end of their freshman year using a recruitment strategy which includes: a) identification of strong performing students in the introductory courses, b) students enrolled in the Honors Program, c) recommendations by faculty members, and d) students responding to advertisements, announcements, and oral presentations. Proposed training is a comprehensive research education plan designed for HUADAR trainees which consists of following components: (1) develop two new courses on aging, (2) exposure to aging research in various laboratories at Howard during sophomore and junior years, (3) attending research seminars by prominent gerontologists, (4) a summer research apprenticeship opportunity outside Howard University in leading research institutes on aging like NIA Baltimore, UT Health Sciences Center, Johns Hopkins, Georgetown University Medical Centers, University of Maryland and University of Washington, (5) writing a honors thesis/senior thesis during senior year, (6) provide one on one mentoring to build a successful career path. Thus, from their sophomore year up to the senior year we have a carefully laid out plans to educate the HUADAR trainees on different aspects of aging research including the social aspects of aging. All students and personnel will be required to participate in instruction on the Responsible Conduct of Research. Evaluation plan for HUADAR will consist of course evaluations, student performances, faculty efficacy surveys, summer research experience surveys, successful completion of an honors thesis/senior thesis. The long-term goal of HUADAR program is to prepare minority students as future researchers through scientific training and educational experiences and we will encourage them to seek aging research as a career goal. Thus we will embrace the goal of NIA ADAR initiative to ""fill a gap in the pipeline transitioning from undergraduate to graduate education in aging as it relates to medicine, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to fulfill the objectives of the NIA Health Disparities Strategic Plan"".         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By 2030 we will be living in an America with 1 in 5 American 65 years or older. The ethnic minority portion of our population is growing at an amazing pace from 4.3 million persons in 1990 to 22.5 million expected by the year 2050. This nation needs to be prepared to deal with ethnically diverse minority elderlies who will account for more than 15% of older persons by 2020 and more than 21% of older persons by 2050. Since health disparity among the ethnically diverse minority population is real and we have to deal with it immediately. Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR) is an attempt to identify a cadre of minority scientists early during their undergraduate years, provide them with a foundation of knowledge and research skills through mentoring so these students will excel in the interdisciplinary field o gerontology. With this conviction, this proposal lay out a detail research education plan to establish an ADAR program at Howard University called HUADAR. In the long term HUADAR trainees will create culturally sensitive health measures to assess the health status of minority elders with greater precision.             ",Advancing aging research through development of minority gerontologists,8740929,R25AG047843,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Baltimore ', ' Biology ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Chemistry ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Graduate Education ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Maryland ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Physics ', ' Physiology ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Amaze ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Oral ', ' Physical Function ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Social status ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' education planning ', ' Advertisements ', ' Ally ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' degenerative disease ', ' degenerative condition ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Length ', ' Undergraduate Degree ', ' Baccalaureate Degree ', "" Bachelor's Degree "", ' doctoral degree ', ' Doctorate Degree ', "" Doctor's Degree "", ' Health Sciences ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' Instruction ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' public health relevance ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate research ', ' ']",NIA,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,R25,2014,360779,0.13044233842832803
"ENERGETICS DISPARITIES & LIFESPAN: A UNIFIED HYPOTHESIS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The evolution and ontogeny of lifespan at the species and individual level, the energetics of the organism in its environment, the storage of metabolizable energy as body fat, and socioeconomic disparities within populations all seem intricately related and yet the nature of these interrelations is poorly understood. Indeed questions as fundamental as why we age remain open and subsidiary questions such as why caloric restriction leads to increased lifespan and why lower socioeconomic status is related to obesity in developed countries also remain unanswered. Herein, we propose a unified model informed by evolutionary thinking about life strategies which connects these phenomena. In this model, aging or more precisely senescence is not something that passively happens to us as the result of environmental insults or from metabolizing fuel, but is something we do. That is, mortality rate or the rate of aging is seen as (partially) internally regulable phenomenon much like the control of body temperature in homeotherms in which the regulated rate is responsive to perceptions about the energetic state of the environment. From this perspective, it is perceptions of the energetic security of the environment that are a key factor in linking these phenomena. We elaborate this theory herein and from it derive seven specific hypotheses, each of which is testable in a different experiment using model organisms. We have assembled a team of the world's leading researchers to conduct these seven experiments and then to conduct follow-up work to study both a priori specified potential causal mechanisms involving internal clock regulation and also to conduct exploratory work to identify new potential mechanisms. Outcomes from this work will have profound implications for our understanding of the nature of aging, of health disparities, and of obesity.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Maximizing quality of life for citizens from all social strata and at all ages requires an understanding of the factors that lead to disparities in health, to differences in body fat levels, and to healthier aging in our increasingly older population.

"NATIONAL HEALTH AND AGING TRENDS STUDY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to continue the National Health and Aging Trend Study (NHATS), which aims (1) to promote scientific inquiry into late-life disability trends and dynamics, their antecedents and correlates, and disparities therein and (2) to advance study of the social and economic consequences of late-life disability for individuals, families, and society. To achieve these aims, in the next 5-year cycle (2014-2018) we will: (a) Collect data in person from the original NHATS cohort annually, including: continued collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; collection of dried blood spots, some to be assayed to foster study of the biologic risk for disability progression, and others to be stored for future use; enhancements to the NHATS interview in key understudied areas of potentially growing importance-use of rehabilitation services aimed at recovery from disability, and the service environment and related amenities that promote independent functioning in retirement and senior community settings-and incorporating new modules submitted by the broader research community. (b) Replenish the sample in Round 5 (2015). Replenishment will be implemented in such a way that NHATS maintains the ability to produce 5-year age estimates (including 90+) and Black-White comparisons. (c) Clean, document and disseminate public use files online and continue to make Medicare claims and other sensitive and restricted files available using established procedures. (d) Undertake methodological studies to improve the efficiency of data collection in future rounds, including testing the sensitivity of key estimates to differential follow-up periods and applying modern measurement approaches such as Item Response Theory (IRT) to measures of capacity. The overarching goal of NHATS is to be a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life. Research using NHATS will foster research to design multi-factor interventions to reduce late-life disability, and will support comprehensive modeling of outcomes of the disability process including living and care arrangements, expenditures, economic well-being, and quality of life.

"NATIONAL HEALTH AND AGING TRENDS STUDY     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to continue the National Health and Aging Trend Study (NHATS), which aims (1) to promote scientific inquiry into late-life disability trends and dynamics, their antecedents and correlates, and disparities therein and (2) to advance study of the social and economic consequences of late-life disability for individuals, families, and society. To achieve these aims, in the next 5-year cycle (2014-2018) we will: (a) Collect data in person from the original NHATS cohort annually, including: continued collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; collection of dried blood spots, some to be assayed to foster study of the biologic risk for disability progression, and others to be stored for future use; enhancements to the NHATS interview in key understudied areas of potentially growing importance-use of rehabilitation services aimed at recovery from disability, and the service environment and related amenities that promote independent functioning in retirement and senior community settings-and incorporating new modules submitted by the broader research community. (b) Replenish the sample in Round 5 (2015). Replenishment will be implemented in such a way that NHATS maintains the ability to produce 5-year age estimates (including 90+) and Black-White comparisons. (c) Clean, document and disseminate public use files online and continue to make Medicare claims and other sensitive and restricted files available using established procedures. (d) Undertake methodological studies to improve the efficiency of data collection in future rounds, including testing the sensitivity of key estimates to differential follow-up periods and applying modern measurement approaches such as Item Response Theory (IRT) to measures of capacity. The overarching goal of NHATS is to be a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life.

"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: renewal 2014     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for competitive funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for the period 2014 - 2020. ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), and recruited 12,100 men and women aged 50 and above who were representative of the older population of England. ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with half of the funding coming from a consortium of UK Government Departments. This renewal request is to fund three waves of data collection - waves 7 (2014/15), 8 (2016/17), and 9 (2018/19) - and associated analyses. The central objective is to provide the high quality data necessary for an exploration of the dynamic relationships between health and functioning, economic position, social participation, wellbeing, cognitive function and health as people plan for, move into and progress beyond retirement. ELSA is a multidisciplinary study, involving the collection of economic, epidemiological, health, social, psychological, physiological and genetic data. The phase of data collection planned in this application will greatly increase the potential for longitudinal analyses so as to examine causal process.  The research agenda of this application is focused on the following broad issues that are important scientifically while also being relevant to policy: comparisons of trajectories of health and wellbeing in England, the USA, and other countries; the determinants of economic wellbeing in older age; the nature and timing of retirement and post-retirement labor market activity; the interaction between psychosocial, genetic, and biological determinants of health and mortality; cognitive functioning and its impact on decision making among older people; disability and the compression of morbidity; the implications of mild cognitive impairment for social, economic and subjective wellbeing; economic, social and health inequalities in an ageing population; social participation and social productivity at older ages; intergenerational relationships and generativity; and health care utilization and transitions to social care.  The specific objectives of the new proposal are to: 1. Design the survey instruments for further waves data collection, building on the existing data from these respondents and maximizing comparability with HRS and other studies 2.

"Energetics, Disparities, & Lifespan: A unified hypothesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The evolution and ontogeny of lifespan at the species and individual level, the energetics of the organism in its environment, the storage of metabolizable energy as body fat, and socioeconomic disparities within populations all seem intricately related and yet the nature of these interrelations is poorly understood. Indeed questions as fundamental as why we age remain open and subsidiary questions such as why caloric restriction leads to increased lifespan and why lower socioeconomic status is related to obesity in developed countries also remain unanswered. Herein, we propose a unified model informed by evolutionary thinking about life strategies which connects these phenomena. In this model, aging or more precisely senescence is not something that passively happens to us as the result of environmental insults or from metabolizing fuel, but is something we do. That is, mortality rate or the rate of aging is seen as (partially) internally regulable phenomenon much like the control of body temperature in homeotherms in which the regulated rate is responsive to perceptions about the energetic state of the environment. From this perspective, it is perceptions of the energetic security of the environment that are a key factor in linking these phenomena. We elaborate this theory herein and from it derive seven specific hypotheses, each of which is testable in a different experiment using model organisms. We have assembled a team of the world's leading researchers to conduct these seven experiments and then to conduct follow-up work to study both a priori specified potential causal mechanisms involving internal clock regulation and also to conduct exploratory work to identify new potential mechanisms. Outcomes from this work will have profound implications for our understanding of the nature of aging, of health disparities, and of obesity.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Maximizing quality of life for citizens from all social strata and at all ages requires an understanding of the factors that lead to disparities in health, to differences in body fat levels, and to healthier aging in our increasingly older population.

The candidate aspires to become a leading independent scientist in the field of aging research. She will devote 100% of her time to this research for the duration of her PhD. Her hands-on training during her dissertation phase, coupled with carefully selected courses, are designed to make her expert in the use of advanced statistical methods to define associations between individual and neighborhood factors, genetic variants, and telomere length. This dual training approach will prepare her for future studies investigating molecular markers associated with aging and the role neighborhood environment and genetics play in health disparities and aging. Throughout this award, she will be mentored by senior experts in behavior, geospatial analyses, aging outcomes, genetics, molecular markers and biostatistics.  The process of cellular aging, as measured by telomere length, likely occurs through the complex interactions of multiple factors over the lifespan. The goal of the research proposed here is to better explain the complex, multifactorial nature of cellular aging using a surrogate biomarker, telomere length. We will undertake a multilevel statistical approach that includes identifying individual-level (Aim 1) and neighborhood- level factors (Aim 2) that affect telomere length and the relationship between telomere genetic variants and telomere length (Aim 3), in an existing multi-ethnic longitudinal cohort of older men. Associations have been reported between telomere length and genetic variants, individual risk behaviors (smoking, body mass index) and sociodemographic variables (an individual's race, sex, social status). However, neighborhood level factors (social isolation, structural decline, violence, etc) represent an important consideration for aging studies since they have been associated with age-related disease and are particularly relevant for older adults, who may live in unfavorable neighborhoods for long time periods. This is the first study to account for the collective effects of multiple factors on telomere length. Using linear regression and backward regression, the applicant will model baseline telomere length (defined by T/S ratio) as a continuous variable, with individual level measures, and select neighborhood factors entered separately as independent variables, using a p-value of 0.20 as the threshold for inclusion. Analyses will be repeated stratifying by race. Clustering and multicollinearity will be considered when assessing the effect of neighborhood variables on telomere length. In order to test the effects of genetic haplotypes in the neighborhood context, we will use multivariable analysis to model telomere length and a vector of covariates identified in Aims 1 and 2. Studies of this nature are critical if genes or individual risk factors affect telomere length more profoundly in certain neighborhood settings. This study will build the foundations of a conceptual model that can be used as the basis for future studies on aging.        The association between genetic variants and telomere length may depend on individual and neighborhood risk factors. Using an interdisciplinary, multi-level statistical approach, this research will better explain the complex, multifactorial nature of cellular aging(measured here by telomere length). This study will help identify health disparities in aging and can serve as a conceptual model for future aging research.

"USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Advances in medicine and technology are providing for longer and healthier lives today. American families have increasingly been asked to take responsibility for their own health and financial outcomes: how long to work, how much to save, when to claim Social Security and pension benefits, which health plans to choose, and how to allocate and manage their assets. Navigating these complex choices may be particularly difficult for minority elderly, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Indeed, health indicators have demonstrated little improvement in health disparities between different racial and ethnic populations over the past decade, according to analyses in Healthy People 2010. Evidence also suggests that minority households tend to be excluded from or participate only on the margins of the financial mainstream. To this end we propose to establish a RCMAR at USC that will develop an infrastructure to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1. Provide leadership, organizational, communication and evaluation systems to achieve the overarching goal of supporting high-quality and enduring research careers in the health and economic challenges of minority elderly; 2. Support pilot study solicitation and selection process to ensure the selection of scientifically rigorous and fundable pilot projects and enhancement of the diversity of researchers; 3. Support pilot-funded investigators through achievement of pilot studies goals and award of an independent grant by multidisciplinary mentoring and training in the methods and tools of economics, computer science, medicine, and social work; 4. Analyze large longitudinal survey data sets and medical claims data on the health, medical care and expenditures, economic status, and financial decisions of diverse elderly populations in order to generate interventions that will address health and economic disparities; 5. Track and evaluate the successes of pilot investigators and data analysis and improve the infrastructure support in accordance with evaluation findings. This proposed RCMAR is a collaboration between USC and RAND that utilizes the resources of USC's Roybal Center on Health Policy Simulation, Roybal Institute on Aging, Alzheimer Disease Research Center, and RAND's Roybal Center for Financial Decision making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the health and economics issues associated with the aging process are of such magnitude and complexity that they cannot be approached from the vantage point of any single discipline alone. With the National Institute on Aging's Priority Area for RCMAR Centers comes a pressing need to build infrastructure that will bring a multidisciplinary approach to the health and economic challenges of minority elderly and have a long-lasting effect on research in this area.",USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR),8688127,P30AG043073,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Household ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Retirement Benefits ', ' Pensions ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Savings ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' American ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' simulation ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Process ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' financial decision making ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,P30,2014,572834,0.0991894194982518
"Rush Center of Excellence on Disparties in HIV and Aging (CEDHA)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the Rush Center of Excellence on Disparities in HIV and Aging (Rush CEDHA) is to provide an infrastructure to support collaborative, multidisciplinary epidemiologic research focused on understanding and eliminating racial disparities in the aging-related consequences of HIV. The proposed Center will integrate and centralize minority health and health disparities research into a single interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary enterprise. It has four Cores and three related research projects to support the goals of the Center. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the CEDHA as a whole. The Research Core will collect annual cognitive and motor function data, psychosocial risk factors, co-morbidities, and biospecimens in older adults (>50 years) with and without HIV infection, and compare them to existing data from HIV-uninfected persons age 65-90 matched on race, gender, and socioeconomic status. The data generated by this Core will be used to support two research projects and one pilot project focused on inflammation and immune senescence in HIV. Project 1 will collect MRI data and serum    inflammatory markers on subjects from the Research Core, and test hypotheses concerning the relationships among age, race, and inflammation in HIV. Project 2 will measure immune perturbations and markers of immune senescence in lymphocytes to estimate the age-associated acceleration in aging due to HIV, and test the hypothesis that racial differences in immune perturbations lead to early immune senescence in African Americans with HIV. Pilot project 1 will conduct a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to explore the safety and estimate the effect offish oil to modulate parameters of aging-related inflammation and immune senescence in HIV. The Research Training/Education Core will centralize education efforts in health disparities research and develop a research training component to mentor early career investigators interested in health disparities. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core will provide a wide range of educational programs to support outreach and recruitment of minorities into studies and disseminate research findings back to the

"Center for Demography of Health and Aging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for continuing support of the Center for Demography of Health and Aging (CDHA) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The overall goal of CDHA is to sustain and improve a major research and training program in the demography of health and aging. The institutional architecture of CDHA is designed to create links between social demography, biomedical and epidemiological research on health and aging.  Major themes of ongoing and developmental research activities within CDHA include (1) Early and mid-life  determinants of late-life health and well-being; (2) Socioeconomic and ethnic disparities of aging  trajectories; (3) Comparative analysis of aging; (4) Economic and social aspects of aging, including wealth  accumulation, retirement, labor force, transfers and late life events and behaviors; and (5) Biodemography,  including data collection and analytical work with biomarkers, gene-environment interactions and the microbiome. CDHA is an autonomous research unit within the College of Letters and Science where it coexists with the Center for Demography and Ecology. It thus shares and extends a well-developed research infrastructure in administration, computing facilities data library, and GIS facilities. CDHA's administrative Core (A) provides leadership and administrative support for the Center as a whole, particularly for activities of Core B. The program development Core (B) supports faculty, staff, and research assistants engaged in innovative, high-risk pilot research projects that are likely to lead to major NIA support. The external innovative network Core (C) will continue a highly successful and popular, networked current awareness service for research in the demography of aging and support regular workshops, conferences, and visits. The external research resources Core (D) support the development of user-friendly tools for the preparation and analysis of large-scale public data resources in the demography of health and aging.

"NATIONAL HEALTH AND AGING TRENDS STUDY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to continue the National Health and Aging Trend Study (NHATS), which aims (1) to promote scientific inquiry into late-life disability trends and dynamics, their antecedents and correlates, and disparities therein and (2) to advance study of the social and economic consequences of late-life disability for individuals, families, and society. To achieve these aims, in the next 5-year cycle (2014-2018) we will: (a) Collect data in person from the original NHATS cohort annually, including: continued collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; collection of dried blood spots, some to be assayed to foster study of the biologic risk for disability progression, and others to be stored for future use; enhancements to the NHATS interview in key understudied areas of potentially growing importance-use of rehabilitation services aimed at recovery from disability, and the service environment and related amenities that promote independent functioning in retirement and senior community settings-and incorporating new modules submitted by the broader research community. (b) Replenish the sample in Round 5 (2015). Replenishment will be implemented in such a way that NHATS maintains the ability to produce 5-year age estimates (including 90+) and Black-White comparisons. (c) Clean, document and disseminate public use files online and continue to make Medicare claims and other sensitive and restricted files available using established procedures. (d) Undertake methodological studies to improve the efficiency of data collection in future rounds, including testing the sensitivity of key estimates to differential follow-up periods and applying modern measurement approaches such as Item Response Theory (IRT) to measures of capacity. The overarching goal of NHATS is to be a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life. Research using NHATS will foster research to design multi-factor interventions to reduce late-life disability, and will support comprehensive modeling of outcomes of the disability process including living and care arrangements, expenditures, economic well-being, and quality of life.

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims represent a systematic continuation of prior RCMAR efforts. Specifically the mission of the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) is to generate knowledge that will reduce health disparities and improve health. To fulfill this mission, MCUAAAR pursues twin goals of: (1) increasing the number of highly trained African American aging researchers; and, (2) including more elderly African American subjects in health disparities research. To achieve these two goals, the continuation application proposes to explore three specific aims: 1) To recruit and mentor 15 new junior scholars into the area of aging and health research; 2) To increase important research on health and health promotion among Older Adults of ethnic and racial populations, especially African Americans; and, 3) To extend research on the recruitment and retention of African American elders in health by utilizing the large MCUAAAR Participant Registry. Among other things, Aims 1 and 2 are motivated by the NIH-funded study (Ginther et al, 2011), which reported that grant applications from black scientists were 10 percentage points less likely to win grants than were applications from white investigators; in practical terms, this gap means that whites are about twice as likely as blacks to win approval. Aim 3 recognizes that a sophisticated social/behavioral approach is required to understand the growing mortality, disease and health disparities among older African Americans. Throughout their training, MCUAAAR scholars will have: unlimited access to the Participant Registry, a research pool of currently 1685 willing minority respondents built over nearly a decade following a Community Based Participatory Model. The significance of this project is directly rooted in three major factors: overcoming critical barriers, improving scientific knowledge, and advancing the field of aging research. The project innovativeness of MCUAAAR resides in three distinctive features: shifts in current paradigms, novel approaches, and refined concepts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need for well-trained faculty of color devoted to the study and amelioration of significant health status and health service disparities is well-documented. The purpose of the MCUAAAR is to provide training for junior scholars to become independent NIH funded researchers, facilitate community outreach and community research participation, and contribute to reducing and the eventual amelioration of race and ethnic health disparities.",Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research,9000877,P30AG015281,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Work ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' ranpirnase ', ' Research Subjects ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Research Training ', ' Behavioral ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2015,23688,0.10096839670803708
"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: renewal 2014 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for competitive funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for the period 2014 - 2020. ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), and recruited 12,100 men and women aged 50 and above who were representative of the older population of England. ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with half of the funding coming from a consortium of UK Government Departments. This renewal request is to fund three waves of data collection - waves 7 (2014/15), 8 (2016/17), and 9 (2018/19) - and associated analyses. The central objective is to provide the high quality data necessary for an exploration of the dynamic relationships between health and functioning, economic position, social participation, wellbeing, cognitive function and health as people plan for, move into and progress beyond retirement. ELSA is a multidisciplinary study, involving the collection of economic, epidemiological, health, social, psychological, physiological and genetic data. The phase of data collection planned in this application will greatly increase the potential for longitudinal analyses so as to examine causal process.  The research agenda of this application is focused on the following broad issues that are important scientifically while also being relevant to policy: comparisons of trajectories of health and wellbeing in England, the USA, and other countries; the determinants of economic wellbeing in older age; the nature and timing of retirement and post-retirement labor market activity; the interaction between psychosocial, genetic, and biological determinants of health and mortality; cognitive functioning and its impact on decision making among older people; disability and the compression of morbidity; the implications of mild cognitive impairment for social, economic and subjective wellbeing; economic, social and health inequalities in an ageing population; social participation and social productivity at older ages; intergenerational relationships and generativity; and health care utilization and transitions to social care.  The specific objectives of the new proposal are to: 1. Design the survey instruments for further waves data collection, building on the existing data from these respondents and maximizing comparability with HRS and other studies 2. Develop and incorporate new assessments of intergenerational transfers, generativity, mild cognitive impairment, hearing, patient preferences and health service use. 3.

"Determinants of Racial Disparities in Alzheimer’s Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The general objective of this proposed renewal for an ADRC at Columbia University is to foster innovative research on AD and related disorders, both locally in our extensive campus and more globally with other institutions and organizations. Informed by the funding opportunity announcement and influenced by recent advancements, a general theme of this renewal is better defining normal aging and the transition from normal aging to the earliest stages of AD.  Since its inception 24 years ago, the ADRC at Columbia has established an elaborate infrastructure for research, fostered interdisciplinary collaborations, established a rich training environment, and promoted outreach and patient recruitment. At the same time the ADRC has become an active participant in a more global network comprised of other institutions, national consortia, and community organizations. During its latest cycle, the ADRC has attained most of its goals and its success is evidenced, for example, by the breadth of its scientific achievements and by its #1 ranking in the number of enrolled and active patients. In this proposed renewal, our ADRC will build off of these prior accomplishments moving forward, and will be motivated by two general goals. The first broad goal is to continue, as in previous cycles, to foster innovative research on AD and related disorders, while the second more specific goal is to support the theme of this cycle. These goals will be accomplished via a number of specific aims, which include: 1) Supporting and integrating the cores and other resources to facilitate research on AD and related disorders. 2) Fostering and expanding our multidisciplinary and multi-department local network at Columbia University with a focus on better understanding the relationship between aging and AD. 3) Fostering and expanding our participation in a global network outside of Columbia University, by playing active roles in national efforts and consortia that collect clinical, genetic, and neuroimaging data, as well as biospecimens. 4) Supporting the development of new techniques and methodologies, particularly in delineating the transition from aging to AD, and supporting the translation of thes findings into better diagnostic, prevention and treatment strategies. 5) Fostering and expanding education and outreach to patients, particularly individuals in the earliest stages of disease, and in the training of young and new investigators.  The cores provide the structural backbone of our ADRC. As evidenced by the success of the cores during the previous cycle the same cores and their leaders will be part of this renewal, thereby assuring smooth continuity and the promise of future success. Besides the Administrative Core, these cores include: A Clinical Core led by Dr. Larry Honig; a Data Management and Statistical Core led by Dr. Howard Andrews; a Neuropathology Core led by Dr. Jean-Paul Vonsattel; a Human Genetics Core led by Dr. Richard Mayeux; and, an Outreach, Retention, and Education Core led by Dr. Karen Bell.  The specific projects allow the ADRC to mobilize towards its scientific goals, and towards its expansionist goals of fostering new science, investigators, and careers. In this proposed renewal the ADRC will support three new projects, all led by new investigators. Dr. Adam Brickman will lead Project 1 entitled, Hippocampal circuitry and white matter abnormalities in aging and AD. Drs. Sandra Barral and Christiane Reitz will co-lead Project 2 entitled, Genetic variations linked to the aging hippocampus. Dr. John Crary will lead Project 3 entitled, Post- transcriptional regulation of tau in aging and AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The general objective of the ADRC at Columbia University is to tackle the main barriers in the field of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, which include early detection, prevention and intervention. In mobilizing towards this ambitious objective, the ADRC will expand its focus to include an investigation on normal aging and how aging translates to the earliest stages of disease. The ADRC will support an infrastructure for research, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, provide a rich training environment, and promote outreach and patient recruitment.

"South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research Undergraduate Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of South Carolina (USC) proposes to establish a South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (SC-ADAR) undergraduate program to increase the number of qualified underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students who pursue scientific graduate studies in programs focusing on science and aging. We are partnering with five Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in South Carolina (SC). The decision to focus on HBCUs was made as HBCUs have a high concentration of low-income, African American undergraduate students, many of whom are majoring in MSTEM fields, and might, through exposure to a research education program focusing on aging research, choose to enter scientific careers committed to addressing the complex biological, biomedical, behavioral, and clinical challenges that accompany aging. The proposed SC-ADAR leverages the Dual PIs' and USC's extensive experience in providing training in aging and MSTEM research for underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students across the continuum of education, from high-school through graduate school and further professional advancement. In addition, the proposed program will draw on USC's long history of collaborating with South Carolina's HBCUs in the development of educational programs for undergraduates in the STEM fields. Specific program aims include: 1) recruiting HBCU undergraduates majoring in STEM fields from five participating HBCUs in SC; 2) implementing a 24-month research education program, including: hands-on mentored research experiences in a research laboratory at USC; co-mentoring system with USC and HBCU faculty; summer coursework on aging; opportunities for joint-learning with other students; academic advising; and career/professional development activities that will assist students in applying to graduate studies in NIA MSTEM fields and professional development activities that will assist HBCU faculty mentors in career advancement in NIA MSTEM research; 3) conducting a process evaluation (to make iterative improvements in the program) and a summative evaluation to measure short-term outcomes (competencies in NIH MSTEM fields and completion of undergraduate degree in MSTEM field) and intermediate-term outcomes (application and transitioning to graduate studies/medical school); and 4) evaluating the success of the program in increasing the capacity and intention of HBCU faculty mentors to conduct research in NIA MSTEM fields. The likelihood of success is enhanced by strong institutional support from USC, USC's existing infrastructure for advancing diversity in STEM, and through the experience of the Dual PIs, with their backgrounds in research training in aging (Dr. Sue Levkoff) and the STEM (Dr. Alan White) fields.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed SC-ADAR institutional Research Education program seeks to address the lack of diversity among scientific experts in the aging field as well as the need for expanded basic and clinical research on health disparities among the aging population. Success in attaining the program aims will contribute to our long-term goal of attaining a diverse workforce of basic and clinical scientists to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse and older population.            ",South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research Undergraduate Program,8935011,R25AG050484,"['Aging ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Graduate Education ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' South Carolina ', ' Students ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' educationally disadvantaged ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Undergraduate Degree ', ' Baccalaureate Degree ', "" Bachelor's Degree "", ' Qualifying ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' R25E Award ', ' R25 Grant ', ' Cancer Education Program (R25) ', ' Cancer Education Grant (R25) ', ' Cancer Education Grant ', ' CEGP ', ' Cancer Education Grant Program ', ' Older Population ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' STEM major ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM class ', ' STEM field ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics ', ' undergraduate education ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R25,2015,349282,0.10127148386590482
"Biodemography of Aging in Wild Chimpanzees     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While it is clear that lifespan was extended during human evolution, there is remarkably little data available to assess the specific ways by which this remarkable change in life history came about. This missing information could importantly inform the understanding of how modern lifestyles, in interaction with our evolved biology, produce the health outcomes observed in developed countries. A major limitation at present is a dearth of data on the aging process in humans' closest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee. The current study would be the first to gather comprehensive data on aging in wild chimpanzees, whose health has not been manipulated by humans during captive management or biomedical experimentation. Like humans during most of their evolutionary history, wild chimpanzees experience frequent nutritional stress and high rates of infectious disease and these processes - little studied in modern aging research - are expected to have shaped species-normative life history strategies. The project entails non-invasive collection of urine and feces from approximately 245 wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) for a broad range of health biomarkers, in additional to observational research for observed morbidity, locomotor proficiency, and social behavior. New data collection will complement and extend existing long-term demographic data, as well as individual histories of social interaction and reproductive effort. The wild data will be supplemented by additional blood-based biomarkers obtained during routine veterinary immobilizations of approximately 240 semi-free ranging chimpanzees in African sanctuaries. The project integrates investigators from major studies of health and aging in human foraging populations, and the central aim (1) of the project is to perform structured comparisons of health and aging between humans and chimpanzees. To further this goal, the additional project aims focus on key variables that are expected to shape senescence, and which are associated with prominent behavioral differences between species: (2) sex differences and the allocation of reproductive effort across the life history, (3) stability of accss to energy, and (4) social status and support. Information gathered in pursuit of these aims has specific relevance to prominent focuses of human aging research: the gender morbidity-mortality paradox, caloric restriction, and the influences of chronic stress and social subordination.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern human aging and mortality patterns result from a combination of our modern lifestyle and our evolved patterns of senescence and repair. While there is excellent information on the former, very little is understood about the processes affecting the evolution of the unusual human lifespan. The current study quantifies aging patterns in wild chimpanzees and incorporates specific comparisons with traditional human populations in order to elucidate key mechanisms of evolutionary change from our ape ancestors.                ",Biodemography of Aging in Wild Chimpanzees,8815516,R01AG049395,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Animals ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Bolivia ', ' Chimpanzee troglodytes ', ' Pan troglodytes ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Immobilization ', ' Infection ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' great ape ', ' Apes ', ' Pongidae ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Tanzania ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Pan Species ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Chimp ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' species difference ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Funding ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' fighting ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' interest ', ' information gathering ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' life history ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' Social status ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' reproductive ', ' Sampling ', ' Habitats ', ' calorie restriction ', ' calorie restricted ', ' Caloric Restriction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Cardiac ', ' urinary ', ' Behavioral ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' comparative ', ' senescent ', ' senescence ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biodemography ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,R01,2015,614953,0.14758530275866813
"Energetics, Disparities, & Lifespan: A unified hypothesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The evolution and ontogeny of lifespan at the species and individual level, the energetics of the organism in its environment, the storage of metabolizable energy as body fat, and socioeconomic disparities within populations all seem intricately related and yet the nature of these interrelations is poorly understood. Indeed questions as fundamental as why we age remain open and subsidiary questions such as why caloric restriction leads to increased lifespan and why lower socioeconomic status is related to obesity in developed countries also remain unanswered. Herein, we propose a unified model informed by evolutionary thinking about life strategies which connects these phenomena. In this model, aging or more precisely senescence is not something that passively happens to us as the result of environmental insults or from metabolizing fuel, but is something we do. That is, mortality rate or the rate of aging is seen as (partially) internally regulable phenomenon much like the control of body temperature in homeotherms in which the regulated rate is responsive to perceptions about the energetic state of the environment. From this perspective, it is perceptions of the energetic security of the environment that are a key factor in linking these phenomena. We elaborate this theory herein and from it derive seven specific hypotheses, each of which is testable in a different experiment using model organisms. We have assembled a team of the world's leading researchers to conduct these seven experiments and then to conduct follow-up work to study both a priori specified potential causal mechanisms involving internal clock regulation and also to conduct exploratory work to identify new potential mechanisms. Outcomes from this work will have profound implications for our understanding of the nature of aging, of health disparities, and of obesity.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Maximizing quality of life for citizens from all social strata and at all ages requires an understanding of the factors that lead to disparities in health, to differences in body fat levels, and to healthier aging in our increasingly older population.

"Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research: This project will create five different one-day conferences on current NIA initiatives that are relevant to minority aging research. The goal of the proposed conference series is to increase the quality, quantity, and relevance to communities of color of NIA-fundable research by providing both junior and senior researchers with new knowledge and greater interest in these emerging issues as they apply to minority elderly. This is significant because the number and proportion of the U.S. older population from racial and ethnic minority communities is growing rapidly: minorities will increase from 20% to over 40% of the older population between 2010 and 2050. Protecting and improving the health of these elderly requires a highly skilled research workforce with interests and capabilities in this area to produce new and useful knowledge. Yet the number and success of minority researchers funded by NIH is insufficient. The NIA's Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) program works to mentor and train junior faculty who conduct research on minority aging to strengthen the next generation of NIA-funded ethnic and racial minority researchers. The conferences will focus on: Cognitive health disparities research and national policy, Use of well-being measures in minority aging research and policy analyses, Stigma in minority aging research, Mutability and reversibility of risk factors across diverse populations, and Concepts and measures of stress and resilience for minority aging research. Each will feature leading scholars on the topic, top scholars on minority aging, and representatives from multiple NIA-funded centers and networks. The programs will disseminate the state of the art on the topic, inform researchers on how existing research needs to be modified or expanded to be more valid and relevant for minority elders, and provide tools that can be used by researchers to further develop the fields in research with minority elders. The conferences will be held as preconferences to the Gerontological Society of America (GSA) annual scientific meetings. There will be at least 50 participants at each conference and the majority will be minorities and/or women. The planning committee will be compromised of the confirmed keynote speakers who are leaders in the field, researchers from RCMAR sites with expertise in the topic, and members of other NIA-funded networks. The executive committee will be the RCMAR directors group. The project is innovative in the topics covered, the research networks involved, and the synergy with GSA. Program evaluation includes a process evaluation, a retrospective pre/post knowledge and confidence survey, and four-month follow-up survey on conference impacts. The lead investigators are national leaders in minority aging and gerontological education who have successfully led 11 previous GSA preconferences that reached over 600 researchers. This proposal is a renewal of the previous successful series with new topics but similar objectives of improving the knowledge and interest in emerging issues supported by NIA among RCMAR Scholars and faculty as well as among others with research agendas in minority aging and related issues; and raising awareness of how minority aging issues intersect these priority topics to promote research in the cutting edge issues. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older adults from racial and ethnic minorities communities often experience health risks and respond to health interventions differently than non-Hispanic whites. Understanding how to maximize the health of all older adults requires researchers who are knowledgeable about the theories, methods, and existing science relevant to minority elders. This conference series will educate researchers about the state of the art in emerging areas of NIA-funded research critical to population health and provide them with skills and motivation to expand that research in minority communities, increasing its relevance to the groups that will soon comprise 40% of the older adult population.",Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research,8825989,R13AG023033,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' journal article ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stream ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' success ', ' Distance Learning ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Committee Members ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' stress resilience ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' biodemography ', ' population health ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Education Module ', ' Learning Module ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R13,2015,50000,0.08785054622227782
"USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Advances in medicine and technology are providing for longer and healthier lives today. American families have increasingly been asked to take responsibility for their own health and financial outcomes: how long to work, how much to save, when to claim Social Security and pension benefits, which health plans to choose, and how to allocate and manage their assets. Navigating these complex choices may be particularly difficult for minority elderly, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Indeed, health indicators have demonstrated little improvement in health disparities between different racial and ethnic populations over the past decade, according to analyses in Healthy People 2010. Evidence also suggests that minority households tend to be excluded from or participate only on the margins of the financial mainstream. To this end we propose to establish a RCMAR at USC that will develop an infrastructure to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1. Provide leadership, organizational, communication and evaluation systems to achieve the overarching goal of supporting high-quality and enduring research careers in the health and economic challenges of minority elderly; 2. Support pilot study solicitation and selection process to ensure the selection of scientifically rigorous and fundable pilot projects and enhancement of the diversity of researchers; 3. Support pilot-funded investigators through achievement of pilot studies goals and award of an independent grant by multidisciplinary mentoring and training in the methods and tools of economics, computer science, medicine, and social work; 4. Analyze large longitudinal survey data sets and medical claims data on the health, medical care and expenditures, economic status, and financial decisions of diverse elderly populations in order to generate interventions that will address health and economic disparities; 5. Track and evaluate the successes of pilot investigators and data analysis and improve the infrastructure support in accordance with evaluation findings. This proposed RCMAR is a collaboration between USC and RAND that utilizes the resources of USC's Roybal Center on Health Policy Simulation, Roybal Institute on Aging, Alzheimer Disease Research Center, and RAND's Roybal Center for Financial Decision making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the health and economics issues associated with the aging process are of such magnitude and complexity that they cannot be approached from the vantage point of any single discipline alone.

"Costa P01Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging  OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - Project Summary/Abstract Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging This program project is a competitive continuation of Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death. Since its inception in 1991, EI has made many discoveries about the longitudinal determinants of retirement and of chronic disease and death at older ages by studying aging processes among Union Army veterans of the US Civil War, a group that mostly reached age 65 between 1885 and 1912. Among these discoveries are "" health at older ages, particularly for African-Americans, was worse than previously thought; "" retirement responsiveness to income transfers was greater than expected; "" social networks affected not just behavior but also health; and, "" stressful events in early life and at young adult ages reduced longevity, but extreme stress after age 30 left  a more robust population. These discoveries were possible because of the creation of longitudinal data sets that follow more than 67,000 Union Army recruits from military service back to childhood and forward to death and contain about 15,000 observations per person. This competitive continuation will take the next step by examining the inter- generational determinants of later longevity and socioeconomic status. The overarching purpose of this continuation is to gain a more precise understanding of 1) how inter- generational processes affect aging and longevity and 2) the mechanisms through which parents transmit socioeconomic status and longevity to their children. Data collected for this continuation will support the research aims outlined in this proposal and will also be made publicly available. We propose two cores and three new scientific projects, which will create intergenerational databases from Early Indicators data: Project #1: Intergenerational Processes and Aging of White Americans Project #2: Intergenerational Processes and Aging of African-Americans Project #3: Intergenerational Processes and Aging in Multiple Generations Core A (Administrative) and B (Data Development) will support data collection, research, and dissemination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the determinants of a long and healthy life has both scientific and policy implications.

"USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Advances in medicine and technology are providing for longer and healthier lives today. American families have increasingly been asked to take responsibility for their own health and financial outcomes: how long to work, how much to save, when to claim Social Security and pension benefits, which health plans to choose, and how to allocate and manage their assets. Navigating these complex choices may be particularly difficult for minority elderly, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Indeed, health indicators have demonstrated little improvement in health disparities between different racial and ethnic populations over the past decade, according to analyses in Healthy People 2010. Evidence also suggests that minority households tend to be excluded from or participate only on the margins of the financial mainstream. To this end we propose to establish a RCMAR at USC that will develop an infrastructure to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1. Provide leadership, organizational, communication and evaluation systems to achieve the overarching goal of supporting high-quality and enduring research careers in the health and economic challenges of minority elderly; 2. Support pilot study solicitation and selection process to ensure the selection of scientifically rigorous and fundable pilot projects and enhancement of the diversity of researchers; 3. Support pilot-funded investigators through achievement of pilot studies goals and award of an independent grant by multidisciplinary mentoring and training in the methods and tools of economics, computer science, medicine, and social work; 4. Analyze large longitudinal survey data sets and medical claims data on the health, medical care and expenditures, economic status, and financial decisions of diverse elderly populations in order to generate interventions that will address health and economic disparities; 5. Track and evaluate the successes of pilot investigators and data analysis and improve the infrastructure support in accordance with evaluation findings. This proposed RCMAR is a collaboration between USC and RAND that utilizes the resources of USC's Roybal Center on Health Policy Simulation, Roybal Institute on Aging, Alzheimer Disease Research Center, and RAND's Roybal Center for Financial Decision making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the health and economics issues associated with the aging process are of such magnitude and complexity that they cannot be approached from the vantage point of any single discipline alone. With the National Institute on Aging's Priority Area for RCMAR Centers comes a pressing need to build infrastructure that will bring a multidisciplinary approach to the health and economic challenges of minority elderly and have a long-lasting effect on research in this area.",USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR),8896384,P30AG043073,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Household ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Retirement Benefits ', ' Pensions ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Savings ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' American ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' simulation ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Process ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' financial decision making ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,P30,2015,534121,0.0991894194982518
"NATIONAL HEALTH AND AGING TRENDS STUDY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to continue the National Health and Aging Trend Study (NHATS), which aims (1) to promote scientific inquiry into late-life disability trends and dynamics, their antecedents and correlates, and disparities therein and (2) to advance study of the social and economic consequences of late-life disability for individuals, families, and society. To achieve these aims, in the next 5-year cycle (2014-2018) we will: (a) Collect data in person from the original NHATS cohort annually, including: continued collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; collection of dried blood spots, some to be assayed to foster study of the biologic risk for disability progression, and others to be stored for future use; enhancements to the NHATS interview in key understudied areas of potentially growing importance-use of rehabilitation services aimed at recovery from disability, and the service environment and related amenities that promote independent functioning in retirement and senior community settings-and incorporating new modules submitted by the broader research community. (b) Replenish the sample in Round 5 (2015). Replenishment will be implemented in such a way that NHATS maintains the ability to produce 5-year age estimates (including 90+) and Black-White comparisons. (c) Clean, document and disseminate public use files online and continue to make Medicare claims and other sensitive and restricted files available using established procedures. (d) Undertake methodological studies to improve the efficiency of data collection in future rounds, including testing the sensitivity of key estimates to differential follow-up periods and applying modern measurement approaches such as Item Response Theory (IRT) to measures of capacity. The overarching goal of NHATS is to be a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life. Research using NHATS will foster research to design multi-factor interventions to reduce late-life disability, and will support comprehensive modeling of outcomes of the disability process including living and care arrangements, expenditures, economic well-being, and quality of life.

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims represent a systematic continuation of prior RCMAR efforts. Specifically the mission of the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) is to generate knowledge that will reduce health disparities and improve health. To fulfill this mission, MCUAAAR pursues twin goals of: (1) increasing the number of highly trained African American aging researchers; and, (2) including more elderly African American subjects in health disparities research. To achieve these two goals, the continuation application proposes to explore three specific aims: 1) To recruit and mentor 15 new junior scholars into the area of aging and health research; 2) To increase important research on health and health promotion among Older Adults of ethnic and racial populations, especially African Americans; and, 3) To extend research on the recruitment and retention of African American elders in health by utilizing the large MCUAAAR Participant Registry. Among other things, Aims 1 and 2 are motivated by the NIH-funded study (Ginther et al, 2011), which reported that grant applications from black scientists were 10 percentage points less likely to win grants than were applications from white investigators; in practical terms, this gap means that whites are about twice as likely as blacks to win approval. Aim 3 recognizes that a sophisticated social/behavioral approach is required to understand the growing mortality, disease and health disparities among older African Americans. Throughout their training, MCUAAAR scholars will have: unlimited access to the Participant Registry, a research pool of currently 1685 willing minority respondents built over nearly a decade following a Community Based Participatory Model.

"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: renewal 2014 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for competitive funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for the period 2014 - 2020. ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), and recruited 12,100 men and women aged 50 and above who were representative of the older population of England. ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with half of the funding coming from a consortium of UK Government Departments. This renewal request is to fund three waves of data collection - waves 7 (2014/15), 8 (2016/17), and 9 (2018/19) - and associated analyses. The central objective is to provide the high quality data necessary for an exploration of the dynamic relationships between health and functioning, economic position, social participation, wellbeing, cognitive function and health as people plan for, move into and progress beyond retirement. ELSA is a multidisciplinary study, involving the collection of economic, epidemiological, health, social, psychological, physiological and genetic data. The phase of data collection planned in this application will greatly increase the potential for longitudinal analyses so as to examine causal process.  The research agenda of this application is focused on the following broad issues that are important scientifically while also being relevant to policy: comparisons of trajectories of health and wellbeing in England, the USA, and other countries; the determinants of economic wellbeing in older age; the nature and timing of retirement and post-retirement labor market activity; the interaction between psychosocial, genetic, and biological determinants of health and mortality; cognitive functioning and its impact on decision making among older people; disability and the compression of morbidity; the implications of mild cognitive impairment for social, economic and subjective wellbeing; economic, social and health inequalities in an ageing population; social participation and social productivity at older ages; intergenerational relationships and generativity; and health care utilization and transitions to social care.  The specific objectives of the new proposal are to: 1. Design the survey instruments for further waves data collection, building on the existing data from these respondents and maximizing comparability with HRS and other studies 2. Develop and incorporate new assessments of intergenerational transfers, generativity, mild cognitive impairment, hearing, patient preferences and health service use. 3. Interview approximately 9,840 respondents in wave 7, 10,118 in wave 8, and 9,650 in wave 9. 4. Collect biomedical and physical performance data from respondents at wave 8 through a nurse visit. 5. Provide ten waves of well-documented panel data to the scientific and policy research community. 6.

"The effects of early life nutritional and hormonal signals on mammalian aging (Health Disparities Admin Supp) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well accepted that early developmental events can have profound long-term effects on health and diseases. For example, Intrauterine growth retardation, maternal nutrition deficiency represent risk factors for development of diseases including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. However, it is unknown whether (or to what extent) these early life events also influence mammalian aging and longevity. On the basis of most recent findings, we hypothesize that the first few weeks of postnatal life represents a critical ""developmental window"" in which the rate of aging is set by a combination of factors including hormonal levels and nutritional signals. To uncover mechanisms responsible for these early life events, we will try to understand when and how early hormonal signaling can have a profound effect on aging rate, lifespan and age-associated metabolic changes. We will also examine the effects of calorie restriction (CR) during early postnatal life. Moreover, we will compared the early life CR effects on the GH-deficient and resistant mice. The results will begin to fill the gap in the present understanding of the developmental influences on aging and metabolism and set the stage for addressing broader questions of major public health significance. To ensure the success of this career development grant, I have assembled a team of experts in the areas that are proposed to be studied in this proposal. All of the mentors have considerable experience in writing and evaluating grant proposals, as well as in researching diverse areas of mammalian aging. We have also developed a complete plan for enhancing my research skills and pushing my career forward. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is aim to address a crucial public health issue in a cost-effective manner because the aging of the Baby Boomer generation is resulting in a massive increase in the absolute number and proportion of elderly Americans. Age is the biggest risk factor for many diseases, leading to increased cost of healthcare. This project will develop new models to study early hormonal signals, lifespan, and age-related diseases in the context of mutations that slow the aging process, and serve as a foundation for promising novel approach for the development of counter-aging therapy.",The effects of early life nutritional and hormonal signals on mammalian aging (Health Disparities Admin

"USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Advances in medicine and technology are providing for longer and healthier lives today. American families have increasingly been asked to take responsibility for their own health and financial outcomes: how long to work, how much to save, when to claim Social Security and pension benefits, which health plans to choose, and how to allocate and manage their assets. Navigating these complex choices may be particularly difficult for minority elderly, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Indeed, health indicators have demonstrated little improvement in health disparities between different racial and ethnic populations over the past decade, according to analyses in Healthy People 2010. Evidence also suggests that minority households tend to be excluded from or participate only on the margins of the financial mainstream. To this end we propose to establish a RCMAR at USC that will develop an infrastructure to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1. Provide leadership, organizational, communication and evaluation systems to achieve the overarching goal of supporting high-quality and enduring research careers in the health and economic challenges of minority elderly; 2. Support pilot study solicitation and selection process to ensure the selection of scientifically rigorous and fundable pilot projects and enhancement of the diversity of researchers; 3. Support pilot-funded investigators through achievement of pilot studies goals and award of an independent grant by multidisciplinary mentoring and training in the methods and tools of economics, computer science, medicine, and social work; 4. Analyze large longitudinal survey data sets and medical claims data on the health, medical care and expenditures, economic status, and financial decisions of diverse elderly populations in order to generate interventions that will address health and economic disparities; 5. Track and evaluate the successes of pilot investigators and data analysis and improve the infrastructure support in accordance with evaluation findings. This proposed RCMAR is a collaboration between USC and RAND that utilizes the resources of USC's Roybal Center on Health Policy Simulation, Roybal Institute on Aging, Alzheimer Disease Research Center, and RAND's Roybal Center for Financial Decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the health and economics issues associated with the aging process are of such magnitude and complexity that they cannot be approached from the vantage point of any single discipline alone. With the National Institute on Aging's Priority Area for RCMAR Centers comes a pressing need to build infrastructure that will bring a multidisciplinary approach to the health and economic challenges of minority elderly and have a long-lasting effect on research in this area.",USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR),9111759,P30AG043073,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Household ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Retirement Benefits ', ' Pensions ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Savings ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' American ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' simulation ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Process ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' financial decision making ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,P30,2016,767827,0.0991894194982518

"The Longitudinal Aging Study in India DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) is a multidisciplinary, internationally harmonized panel study designed to be nationally representative of India's population aged 45 and older. LASI collects information conceptually comparable to that gathered by the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and its sister surveys in Asia, Europe, and elsewhere. LASI has brought innovations related to social connectedness, expectations, informal labor market activity, and pension participation. LASI also collects physical measures of health, including dried blood spot (DBS) specimens. Fieldwork for a four-state pilot study funded by the National Institute on Aging (1R21AG032572-01) was successfully implemented in late 2010. Building on the success of the LASI pilot survey, we will implement the first two waves of a large-scale, nationally representative panel survey on aging, health, and retirement in India, with sufficient statistical power to test hypotheses and make meaningful inferences at the national and (large) state level, and in key subpopulations. LASI will allow a better understanding of the determinants and consequences of India's population aging processes and will inform the design of appropriate evidence-based policies to address key challenges associated with population aging. Our public, internationally harmonized data will also allow for cross-national comparative studies on aging. We will field the full-scale, national LASI survey in 15 states, which together make up more than 90% of India's population. The survey instrument will be based on the pilot survey instrument, which was carefully designed to collect information compatible with other HRS-type surveys, while fully capturing key contextual characteristics of India. The target sample for LASI is non- institutionalized Indian residents aged 45 and older and their spouses (irrespective of age). We will draw 18,000 age-qualifying individuals from a stratified, multi-stage, area probability sampling design. Efforts are well unde way to raise additional, non-NIA/NIH funding to extend LASI coverage to India's smaller states and increase sample size and to thereby allow for a more extensive set of state-level inferences and cross-state comparisons. Wave 1 of LASI survey data will be collected in 2013-2014 through face-to-face interviews using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing. We will then develop and test a longitudinal survey instrument and methods that will be appropriate for follow-up waves, using the pilot sample. Based on the knowledge gained from Wave 1 and the longitudinal methods study using the pilot sample, we will implement Wave 2 in 2015- 2016. In the course of implementing Wave 2, we will seek to follow best practices from the Indonesia Family Life Study, which achieved a 6% attrition rate. Descriptive and analytic studies of the data will be performed, providing insights for scientific researchers and policy makers in India and beyond. De-identified and cleaned data will be made publicly available within one year of fieldwork completion, enabling scientists both within and outside India to use the rich LASI data. Through comparative studies, LASI will enrich scientific insights and policy development in countries besides India. In particular, LASI will provide new research opportunities in the United States and in countries that host comparable HRS-type surveys, such as China and Indonesia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) is proposed as a full-scale, national survey that will directly facilitate increased scientific investigation of the economic, social, and biological determinants and consequences of population aging in India. Internationally harmonized, de-identified panel data will be publicly available online, enabling cross-state analyses within India and cross-national comparison of the relationships among retirement, aging, and health.

"NATIONAL HEALTH AND AGING TRENDS STUDY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to continue the National Health and Aging Trend Study (NHATS), which aims (1) to promote scientific inquiry into late-life disability trends and dynamics, their antecedents and correlates, and disparities therein and (2) to advance study of the social and economic consequences of late-life disability for individuals, families, and society. To achieve these aims, in the next 5-year cycle (2014-2018) we will: (a) Collect data in person from the original NHATS cohort annually, including: continued collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; collection of dried blood spots, some to be assayed to foster study of the biologic risk for disability progression, and others to be stored for future use; enhancements to the NHATS interview in key understudied areas of potentially growing importance-use of rehabilitation services aimed at recovery from disability, and the service environment and related amenities that promote independent functioning in retirement and senior community settings-and incorporating new modules submitted by the broader research community. (b) Replenish the sample in Round 5 (2015). Replenishment will be implemented in such a way that NHATS maintains the ability to produce 5-year age estimates (including 90+) and Black-White comparisons. (c) Clean, document and disseminate public use files online and continue to make Medicare claims and other sensitive and restricted files available using established procedures. (d) Undertake methodological studies to improve the efficiency of data collection in future rounds, including testing the sensitivity of key estimates to differential follow-up periods and applying modern measurement approaches such as Item Response Theory (IRT) to measures of capacity. The overarching goal of NHATS is to be a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life. Research using NHATS will foster research to design multi-factor interventions to reduce late-life disability, and will support comprehensive modeling of outcomes of the disability process including living and care arrangements, expenditures, economic well-being, and quality of life.

"NATIONAL HEALTH AND AGING TRENDS STUDY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to continue the National Health and Aging Trend Study (NHATS), which aims (1) to promote scientific inquiry into late-life disability trends and dynamics, their antecedents and correlates, and disparities therein and (2) to advance study of the social and economic consequences of late-life disability for individuals, families, and society. To achieve these aims, in the next 5-year cycle (2014-2018) we will: (a) Collect data in person from the original NHATS cohort annually, including: continued collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; collection of dried blood spots, some to be assayed to foster study of the biologic risk for disability progression, and others to be stored for future use; enhancements to the NHATS interview in key understudied areas of potentially growing importance-use of rehabilitation services aimed at recovery from disability, and the service environment and related amenities that promote independent functioning in retirement and senior community settings-and incorporating new modules submitted by the broader research community. (b) Replenish the sample in Round 5 (2015). Replenishment will be implemented in such a way that NHATS maintains the ability to produce 5-year age estimates (including 90+) and Black-White comparisons. (c) Clean, document and disseminate public use files online and continue to make Medicare claims and other sensitive and restricted files available using established procedures. (d) Undertake methodological studies to improve the efficiency of data collection in future rounds, including testing the sensitivity of key estimates to differential follow-up periods and applying modern measurement approaches such as Item Response Theory (IRT) to measures of capacity. The overarching goal of NHATS is to be a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life. Research using NHATS will foster research to design multi-factor interventions to reduce late-life disability, and will support comprehensive modeling of outcomes of the disability process including living and care arrangements, expenditures, economic well-being, and quality of life.

"An Experimental Investigation into the Impact of Socioeconomic Context on Biological Markers of Aging, Health and Mortality Poverty disproportionately impacts minority and rural populations and is very strongly correlated with poor health over the life cycle, and has been hypothesized to lead to a shorter, less healthy aging process. Poverty is associated with a greater burden of disease than smoking and obesity combined and accounts for the bulk of health disparities by race. It is widely believed that an anti-poverty policy—such as Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)—could improve healthy aging among working-age low-income adults over the life cycle. It does so by increasing material hardship and psychological stress—two risk factors that are strongly correlated with biological markers of premature aging (e.g., shorter telomeres, higher cholesterol levels, and higher blood pressure.) However, the literature linking poverty to health is largely built on correlational data, which is subject to confounding and reverse causation. The experienced research firm MDRC has secured private and public funding for a groundbreaking multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) that examines the causal impacts of quadrupling EITC for working adults without dependent children in Atlanta, GA and New York City, NY called Paycheck Plus (PP). Randomization exposes the treatment group to up to $2000 in PP compared to up to $496 in the control group. However, MDRC is not studying the impacts of PP on health. We propose leveraging MDRC’s existing infrastructure and our long history of collaboration with MDRC to add clinical, survey, and administrative measures to explore whether PP improves the health and survival of adult recipients without dependent children. Timed with launch of the study in Atlanta, we propose in-person health screenings with collection of important biomarkers of chronic disease, such as blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), blood glucose, cholesterol, and C-reactive protein (measures that are conceptually linked to poverty). For both the NYC and Atlanta Cohorts, we propose adding survey data that measures health-related quality of life and depression. Since not everybody randomized to the treatment group will file taxes (a requisite for the treated group to receive PP or the control group to receive traditional EITC), we will analyze our health outcomes using an Intent to Treat (ITT) versus Treatment on the Treated (ToT) analysis. This will produce Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) estimates of the unbiased impact of increased PP on health. In addition, we will collect long-term follow up data on mortality for both treatment sites. We will do so by linking individual identifiers administrative mortality data from the National Death Index. Finally, we will model the health and longevity gains associated with PP relative to traditional EITC. This project is innovative for exploiting a planned and fully funded social science experiment to explore outcome measures that were not originally considered by the policymakers. This project is also innovative for being a RTC of an anti-poverty program that uses administrative and clinical health data at a very low cost. We anticipate that PP will be an efficient approach to promoting healthy aging by lifting adults without dependent children out of poverty. Narrative The Columbia University team has partnered with the research firm MDRC to conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) that examines the health and survival outcomes associated with an extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for lower-income Americans without dependent children. Associational evidence suggests that EITC may have a significant impact on the health and survival over the life cycle of those who receive the credit, leading to healthy aging. However, experimental data is needed to prove this linkage.","An Experimental Investigation into the Impact of Socioeconomic Context on Biological Markers of Aging, Health and Mortality",9214546,R01AG054466,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cholesterol ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Informed Consent Forms ', ' Informed Consent Documents ', ' Consent Documents ', ' Consent Forms ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Glycated Hemoglobins ', ' Glycosylated Hemoglobin ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Blood Tests ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Income Tax ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' alpha-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' HDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Cholesterol ', ' High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Rural Population ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Sciences ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' psychological stressor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Lifting ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Premature Aging ', ' Premature aging syndrome ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Spottings ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' medical examination ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Telomere Shortening ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' health economics ', ' health related quality of life ', ' markov model ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' treatment effect ', ' treatment site ', ' healthy aging ', ' high risk ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' social science research ', ' Secure ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' health data ', ' treatment group ', ' survival outcome ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,642010,0.09848603735423928
"Disparities in Immune Fitness in HIV+ Subjects with Aging HIV has become a chronic disease in the US due to efficient virus control by antiretroviral therapy (ART). With that, the population over age 50 with controlled HIV is growing and already numbers >600,000 people in the US. With age these individuals experience multiple comorbidities that appear independent of HIV itself, and anecdotally some of the pathophysiology in HIV+ individuals appears as pronounced/accelerated aging. Inflammation and a decline in immune function accompany both HIV and aging, suggesting that both could potentiate and/or drive aspects of exacerbated aging in people with HIV. Persistent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was implicated in immune aging and age-related inflammation too, but there are significant individual variations and an incomplete understanding on how CMV is controlled with aging. Limited data suggests that the premature “aging” phenotype seen in HIV+ patients is only found in those co-infected with CMV, but the control of CMV in HIV+ subjects, particularly those over 50, remains poorly understood.  Hispanic Americans experience a disproportional number of HIV infections and are also likely to acquire CMV earlier and at higher rate compared to non-Hispanic Americans. With the Hispanics bearing a large HIV and CMV burden, it is critical to understand how ethnicity affects aging with HIV and CMV.  To that effect, this exploratory proposal seeks to establish whether HIV+ Hispanic Americans (HIV+HA) exhibit different (increased) systemic inflammation (cytokines and inflammatory markers) and reduced adaptive immune fitness (homeostasis at baseline and response to CMV and influenza vaccination) compared to HIV+ non-Hispanics (HIV+nHA) in the course of aging. The Aims will ask:  SA1. Is Hispanic ethnicity in HIV+ subjects associated with accentuated inflammation and pronounced defects of immune homeostasis in aging?  SA2. Do ethnic disparities in HIV+ subjects critically modulate immune response fitness with aging?  The above experiments will provide a hypothesis-generating foundation for larger mechanistic studies of cellular and molecular inflammatory and immune pathways that may explain how Hispanic Americans handle immune aging with HIV. Hispanic Americans disproportionally suffer from HIV infections and also acquire the cytomegalovirus (CMV) early and in larger numbers compared to non-Hispanics. Our experiments will obtain key initial data on the interplay of HIV+ status, aging and Hispanic ethnicity in regulating inflammation and immune fitness. As such, they will provide a foundation for larger mechanistic studies of cellular and molecular inflammatory and immune pathways that may explain how this group of Americans handles immune aging with HIV, helping to set future group-specific treatments to achieve successful aging with HIV.  ",Disparities in Immune Fitness in HIV+ Subjects with Aging,9203464,R21AG054317,"['Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HLA-MT Antigens ', ' HLA-MT ', ' HLA-DR ', ' HLA-D-Related Antigens ', ' HLA-BR Antigens ', ' HLA-BR ', ' HLA-DR Antigens ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' Inflammation ', ' lFN-Gamma ', ' Interferon-gamma ', ' Interferon Gamma ', ' Immune Interferon ', ' IFNγ ', ' IFNG ', ' IFN-γ ', ' IFN-g ', ' IFN-Gamma ', ' Gamma interferon ', ' Interferon Type II ', ' IFN ', ' Interferons ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) The Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) has three research themes: 1) understanding multilevel determinants of disparities, 2) evaluating through secondary data analysis the effects of policies that reduce public services among minority older adults, and 3) translating evidence-based interventions to prevent/manage chronic conditions and mitigate the effects of stressful environments in minority communities. The Administrative Core will coordinate all CADC functions, select pilot studies for funding, host Advisory Board meetings, allocate effort to update the web site, and sustain collaborations with UCSF colleagues. The Investigator Development Core will fund 3-5 scholars every year through the process of Request for Proposals and review. CADC faculty will formally mentor funded scholars to completion of their research, publication of a paper, submission of a faculty development or independent research grant to NIA/NIH, and becoming established in their academic units. The multidisciplinary nature of CADC faculty provide scholars with a variety of content mentors in the clinical, epidemiological, behavioral, and social sciences, including a neuroscientist and health economist. We will promote use of secondary datasets to identify multi-level determinants of disparities and evaluate the impact of policy changes using interrupted time-series methods. We will also encourage scholars to develop pilot interventions to reduce health disparities. The Community Liaison Core will support recruitment of research participants for funded projects, advance the science of recruitment and disseminate research findings to the target communities. The Analysis Core will work closely with scholars to provide technical assistance in specialized methods in minority aging, develop measurement projects to identify determinants of disparities, and provide guidance to pilot test community-based interventions. In sum, CADC will continue to foster development of ethnically diverse investigators who will conduct research with older minority persons at UCSF and in Northern California.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Center for Aging in Diverse Communities is supporting the development of race and ethnic minority scholars who are addressing research topics in minority aging. The provision of pilot grants in a supportive and intellectually rich environment with strong linkages to the target communities in the area facilitate the successful development of new investigators at the same time that knowledge is advanced regarding the mechanisms of health disparities and how to decrease these.",Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC),9180384,P30AG015272,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Buffers ', ' California ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Organizational Unit ', ' Organization administrative structures ', ' Paper ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' career ', ' 85+ years old ', ' human very old age (85+) ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Sum ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' teacher development ', ' instructor training ', ' faculty professional development ', ' faculty development ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' faculty community ', ' nature center ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' minority investigator ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",P30,2016,51419,0.10561917292871573
"Costa P01Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging  OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - Project Summary/Abstract Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging This program project is a competitive continuation of Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death. Since its inception in 1991, EI has made many discoveries about the longitudinal determinants of retirement and of chronic disease and death at older ages by studying aging processes among Union Army veterans of the US Civil War, a group that mostly reached age 65 between 1885 and 1912. Among these discoveries are "" health at older ages, particularly for African-Americans, was worse than previously thought; "" retirement responsiveness to income transfers was greater than expected; "" social networks affected not just behavior but also health; and, "" stressful events in early life and at young adult ages reduced longevity, but extreme stress after age 30 left  a more robust population. These discoveries were possible because of the creation of longitudinal data sets that follow more than 67,000 Union Army recruits from military service back to childhood and forward to death and contain about 15,000 observations per person. This competitive continuation will take the next step by examining the inter- generational determinants of later longevity and socioeconomic status. The overarching purpose of this continuation is to gain a more precise understanding of 1) how inter- generational processes affect aging and longevity and 2) the mechanisms through which parents transmit socioeconomic status and longevity to their children. Data collected for this continuation will support the research aims outlined in this proposal and will also be made publicly available. We propose two cores and three new scientific projects, which will create intergenerational databases from Early Indicators data: Project #1: Intergenerational Processes and Aging of White Americans Project #2: Intergenerational Processes and Aging of African-Americans Project #3: Intergenerational Processes and Aging in Multiple Generations Core A (Administrative) and B (Data Development) will support data collection, research, and dissemination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the determinants of a long and healthy life has both scientific and policy implications. It can provide insights into future longevity and health trends; into the ages at which health and human capital investments may be most effective; and into ways that intergenerational factors may lead to the persistence of inequality in longevity, health, and socioeconomic status by race.            ","Costa P01Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging",9060821,P01AG010120,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Attitude ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Generation Effect ', ' Cohort Effect ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Investments ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Experience ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Printing ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisoner ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Retirement ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' Shock ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' War ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' Left ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Distant ', ' Soldier ', ' Services ', ' environmental stressor ', ' intergenerational ', ' family structure ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' human capital ', ' dissemination research ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' user-friendly ', ' public health relevance ', ' health inequalities ', ' policy implication ', ' program dissemination ', ' project dissemination ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2016,2685523,0.13178243122553399
"Energetics, Disparities, & Lifespan: A unified hypothesis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The evolution and ontogeny of lifespan at the species and individual level, the energetics of the organism in its environment, the storage of metabolizable energy as body fat, and socioeconomic disparities within populations all seem intricately related and yet the nature of these interrelations is poorly understood. Indeed questions as fundamental as why we age remain open and subsidiary questions such as why caloric restriction leads to increased lifespan and why lower socioeconomic status is related to obesity in developed countries also remain unanswered. Herein, we propose a unified model informed by evolutionary thinking about life strategies which connects these phenomena. In this model, aging or more precisely senescence is not something that passively happens to us as the result of environmental insults or from metabolizing fuel, but is something we do. That is, mortality rate or the rate of aging is seen as (partially) internally regulable phenomenon much like the control of body temperature in homeotherms in which the regulated rate is responsive to perceptions about the energetic state of the environment. From this perspective, it is perceptions of the energetic security of the environment that are a key factor in linking these phenomena. We elaborate this theory herein and from it derive seven specific hypotheses, each of which is testable in a different experiment using model organisms. We have assembled a team of the world's leading researchers to conduct these seven experiments and then to conduct follow-up work to study both a priori specified potential causal mechanisms involving internal clock regulation and also to conduct exploratory work to identify new potential mechanisms. Outcomes from this work will have profound implications for our understanding of the nature of aging, of health disparities, and of obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Maximizing quality of life for citizens from all social strata and at all ages requires an understanding of the factors that lead to disparities in health, to differences in body fat levels, and to healthier aging in our increasingly older population. The proposed research will contribute such knowledge.","Energetics, Disparities, & Lifespan: A unified hypothesis",9068744,R01AG043972,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' animal food ', ' Animal Feed ', ' Animals ', ' anorexic agent ', ' Appetite-Suppressant Drugs ', ' Appetite-Depressing Drugs ', ' Appetite Suppressants ', ' Anorexigenic Drugs ', ' Anorexient Drug ', ' Anorexient Agent ', ' Anorexic Drugs ', ' Anorexiant ', ' Anorectics ', ' Anorectic agent ', ' Anorectic Drug ', ' Appetite Depressants ', ' internal clock ', ' body clock ', ' Biologic Clock ', ' Biological Clocks ', ' Body Temperature ', ' Breeding ', ' Buffers ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hunger ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Maintenance ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Perception ', ' predation ', ' Predatory Behavior ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rose ', ' Rosa ', ' Taxation ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Schedule ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' exhaust ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self Perception ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Genetic ', ' Body fat ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' soma ', ' neural cell body ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' reproductive ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' mimetics ', ' calorie restriction ', ' calorie restricted ', ' calorically restricted ', ' caloric restricted ', ' Caloric Restriction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' fitness ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Control Animal ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Older Population ', ' Security ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' Food Energy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' mathematical theory ', ' mathematics theory ', ' mathematics reasoning ', ' mathematics logic ', ' mathematic theory ', ' math theory ', ' Mathematical Reasoning ', ' Mathematical Logic ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' healthy aging ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2016,727926,0.10960573400498534
"Rush Center of Excellence on Disparties in HIV and Aging (CEDHA)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the Rush Center of Excellence on Disparities in HIV and Aging (Rush CEDHA) is to provide an infrastructure to support collaborative, multidisciplinary epidemiologic research focused on understanding and eliminating racial disparities in the aging-related consequences of HIV. The proposed Center will integrate and centralize minority health and health disparities research into a single interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary enterprise. It has four Cores and three related research projects to support the goals of the Center. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the CEDHA as a whole. The Research Core will collect annual cognitive and motor function data, psychosocial risk factors, co-morbidities, and biospecimens in older adults (>50 years) with and without HIV infection, and compare them to existing data from HIV-uninfected persons age 65-90 matched on race, gender, and socioeconomic status. The data generated by this Core will be used to support two research projects and one pilot project focused on inflammation and immune senescence in HIV. Project 1 will collect MRI data and serum    inflammatory markers on subjects from the Research Core, and test hypotheses concerning the relationships among age, race, and inflammation in HIV. Project 2 will measure immune perturbations and markers of immune senescence in lymphocytes to estimate the age-associated acceleration in aging due to HIV, and test the hypothesis that racial differences in immune perturbations lead to early immune senescence in African Americans with HIV. Pilot project 1 will conduct a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to explore the safety and estimate the effect offish oil to modulate parameters of aging-related inflammation and immune senescence in HIV. The Research Training/Education Core will centralize education efforts in health disparities research and develop a research training component to mentor early career investigators interested in health disparities. The Community Engagement/Outreach Core will provide a wide range of educational programs to support outreach and recruitment of minorities into studies and disseminate research findings back to the communities experiencing the health disparities.              RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The rich resources generated by the Rush CEDHA will provide the research community with unparalleled

"Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims represent a systematic continuation of prior RCMAR efforts. Specifically the mission of the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) is to generate knowledge that will reduce health disparities and improve health. To fulfill this mission, MCUAAAR pursues twin goals of: (1) increasing the number of highly trained African American aging researchers; and, (2) including more elderly African American subjects in health disparities research. To achieve these two goals, the continuation application proposes to explore three specific aims: 1) To recruit and mentor 15 new junior scholars into the area of aging and health research; 2) To increase important research on health and health promotion among Older Adults of ethnic and racial populations, especially African Americans; and, 3) To extend research on the recruitment and retention of African American elders in health by utilizing the large MCUAAAR Participant Registry. Among other things, Aims 1 and 2 are motivated by the NIH-funded study (Ginther et al, 2011), which reported that grant applications from black scientists were 10 percentage points less likely to win grants than were applications from white investigators; in practical terms, this gap means that whites are about twice as likely as blacks to win approval. Aim 3 recognizes that a sophisticated social/behavioral approach is required to understand the growing mortality, disease and health disparities among older African Americans. Throughout their training, MCUAAAR scholars will have: unlimited access to the Participant Registry, a research pool of currently 1685 willing minority respondents built over nearly a decade following a Community Based Participatory Model. The significance of this project is directly rooted in three major factors: overcoming critical barriers, improving scientific knowledge, and advancing the field of aging research. The project innovativeness of MCUAAAR resides in three distinctive features: shifts in current paradigms, novel approaches, and refined concepts.	           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need for well-trained faculty of color devoted to the study and amelioration of significant health status and health service disparities is well-documented. The purpose of the MCUAAAR is to provide training for junior scholars to become independent NIH funded researchers, facilitate community outreach and community research participation, and contribute to reducing and the eventual amelioration of race and ethnic health disparities.",Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research,9111777,P30AG015281,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Work ', ' ranpirnase ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' Research Subjects ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Research Training ', ' Behavioral ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' teacher development ', ' instructor training ', ' faculty professional development ', ' faculty development ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' faculty research ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2016,794338,0.10096839670803708
"Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research: This project will create five different one-day conferences on current NIA initiatives that are relevant to minority aging research. The goal of the proposed conference series is to increase the quality, quantity, and relevance to communities of color of NIA-fundable research by providing both junior and senior researchers with new knowledge and greater interest in these emerging issues as they apply to minority elderly. This is significant because the number and proportion of the U.S. older population from racial and ethnic minority communities is growing rapidly: minorities will increase from 20% to over 40% of the older population between 2010 and 2050. Protecting and improving the health of these elderly requires a highly skilled research workforce with interests and capabilities in this area to produce new and useful knowledge. Yet the number and success of minority researchers funded by NIH is insufficient. The NIA's Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) program works to mentor and train junior faculty who conduct research on minority aging to strengthen the next generation of NIA-funded ethnic and racial minority researchers. The conferences will focus on: Cognitive health disparities research and national policy, Use of well-being measures in minority aging research and policy analyses, Stigma in minority aging research, Mutability and reversibility of risk factors across diverse populations, and Concepts and measures of stress and resilience for minority aging research. Each will feature leading scholars on the topic, top scholars on minority aging, and representatives from multiple NIA-funded centers and networks. The programs will disseminate the state of the art on the topic, inform researchers on how existing research needs to be modified or expanded to be more valid and relevant for minority elders, and provide tools that can be used by researchers to further develop the fields in research with minority elders. The conferences will be held as preconferences to the Gerontological Society of America (GSA) annual scientific meetings. There will be at least 50 participants at each conference and the majority will be minorities and/or women. The planning committee will be compromised of the confirmed keynote speakers who are leaders in the field, researchers from RCMAR sites with expertise in the topic, and members of other NIA-funded networks. The executive committee will be the RCMAR directors group. The project is innovative in the topics covered, the research networks involved, and the synergy with GSA. Program evaluation includes a process evaluation, a retrospective pre/post knowledge and confidence survey, and four-month follow-up survey on conference impacts. The lead investigators are national leaders in minority aging and gerontological education who have successfully led 11 previous GSA preconferences that reached over 600 researchers. This proposal is a renewal of the previous successful series with new topics but similar objectives of improving the knowledge and interest in emerging issues supported by NIA among RCMAR Scholars and faculty as well as among others with research agendas in minority aging and related issues; and raising awareness of how minority aging issues intersect these priority topics to promote research in the cutting edge issues. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older adults from racial and ethnic minorities communities often experience health risks and respond to health interventions differently than non-Hispanic whites. Understanding how to maximize the health of all older adults requires researchers who are knowledgeable about the theories, methods, and existing science relevant to minority elders. This conference series will educate researchers about the state of the art in emerging areas of NIA-funded research critical to population health and provide them with skills and motivation to expand that research in minority communities, increasing its relevance to the groups that will soon comprise 40% of the older adult population.",Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research,9038203,R13AG023033,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Exercise ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caring ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' journal article ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stream ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' field study ', ' success ', ' Distance Learning ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Committee Members ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' stress resilience ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' biodemography ', ' population health ', ' Learning Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Education Module ', ' faculty research ', ' Skills Development ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R13,2016,50000,0.08785054622227782
"Midcareer Mentoring Award for Patient-Oriented Research in Aging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My over-arching career goals as a geriatrician and clinical investigator are to conduct high quality patient- oriented research in aging and palliativ care, train the next generation of investigators to conduct this research and through my research and mentoring activities improve the health care of older persons living with advanced illness. Over the past 16 years, I have built a successful research program focused on outcomes, decision-making, and health care utilization in advanced dementia. My initial K24 was awarded in 2009. My productivity during its course is evident through the high impact of my research, mentees' accomplishments, and my leadership roles. Building on this success, I feel am at an optimal time to renew this award. The observational studies I have conducted to date have clearly shown that advanced dementia patients receive sub-optimal palliative care, but also elucidated opportunities for improvement. Designing and testing interventions targeting those opportunities is the current priority for the field, and the focus of my research during this K24 renewal. The initial K24 period was critical in providing the protected time needed to be an effective mentor, gain mentoring skills, and build a cadre of young investigators skilled in palliative care aging research. Renewal of my K24 is essential for this momentum to continue. The objectives for my 5-year K24 renewal period are: 1. To continue to build a research program focused on improving the quality of care for older patients with advanced dementia, with a new direction on clinical trials. This will be accomplished by: i. completion of currently funded observational studies, ii. new research involving cluster randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing practice interventions in advanced dementia, and iii. formal training activities to deepen my expertise in clinical trials research; 2. To use my research as a platform to mentor new investigators in aging-related palliative care research to help them become independent investigators and support the expansion of my research program and the field with highly trained faculty. This will be accomplished by: i. involvement of my trainees in my funded projects, ii. leveraging my research infrastructure to enable my mentees' investigations. iii. recruitment of high caliber mentees from varied disciplines committed to this field, iv. individual mentorship of these trainees in their research activities and career development, v. didactic sessions and formal coursework for mentees. IMPACT: The focus of my new research, career development and mentorship in clinical trials is the next necessary step to move the field of advanced dementia forward. The findings, methodological advancements, and infrastructure gained through this work, can be leveraged for the next phase of research translation: implementation and dissemination of proven interventions. Ultimately, my ongoing and new research proposed for the second cycle of my K24, coupled with my training of outstanding investigators in the field of palliative care and aging, and will help address the critical and pressing need to bring high quality and cost-effective palliative care to the bedside of the millions of older Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With the renewal of this k24 award, Dr. Susan Mitchell will continue to develop her successful research program aimed at improving the end-of-life experience of persons with advanced dementia and their families, with a new focus on the conduct of clinical trials research.

"South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research Undergraduate Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of South Carolina (USC) proposes to establish a South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (SC-ADAR) undergraduate program to increase the number of qualified underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students who pursue scientific graduate studies in programs focusing on science and aging. We are partnering with five Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in South Carolina (SC). The decision to focus on HBCUs was made as HBCUs have a high concentration of low-income, African American undergraduate students, many of whom are majoring in MSTEM fields, and might, through exposure to a research education program focusing on aging research, choose to enter scientific careers committed to addressing the complex biological, biomedical, behavioral, and clinical challenges that accompany aging. The proposed SC-ADAR leverages the Dual PIs' and USC's extensive experience in providing training in aging and MSTEM research for underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students across the continuum of education, from high-school through graduate school and further professional advancement. In addition, the proposed program will draw on USC's long history of collaborating with South Carolina's HBCUs in the development of educational programs for undergraduates in the STEM fields. Specific program aims include: 1) recruiting HBCU undergraduates majoring in STEM fields from five participating HBCUs in SC; 2) implementing a 24-month research education program, including: hands-on mentored research experiences in a research laboratory at USC; co-mentoring system with USC and HBCU faculty; summer coursework on aging; opportunities for joint-learning with other students; academic advising; and career/professional development activities that will assist students in applying to graduate studies in NIA MSTEM fields and professional development activities that will assist HBCU faculty mentors in career advancement in NIA MSTEM research; 3) conducting a process evaluation (to make iterative improvements in the program) and a summative evaluation to measure short-term outcomes (competencies in NIH MSTEM fields and completion of undergraduate degree in MSTEM field) and intermediate-term outcomes (application and transitioning to graduate studies/medical school); and 4) evaluating the success of the program in increasing the capacity and intention of HBCU faculty mentors to conduct research in NIA MSTEM fields. The likelihood of success is enhanced by strong institutional support from USC, USC's existing infrastructure for advancing diversity in STEM, and through the experience of the Dual PIs, with their backgrounds in research training in aging (Dr. Sue Levkoff) and the STEM (Dr. Alan White) fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed SC-ADAR institutional Research Education program seeks to address the lack of diversity among scientific experts in the aging field as well as the need for expanded basic and clinical research on health disparities among the aging population.

"Gene-Environment Interplay of Social Contexts and Aging-Related Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competing application seeks to extend, for a further 5 years, the consortium on Interplay of Genes and Environment across Multiple Studies. During the first funding cycle, we established a new collaboration among 8 existing longitudinal twin studies in the U.S., Sweden, and Denmark, set the stage for including an additional 7 longitudinal twin studies from the U.S., Finland, and Australia, and laid the foundation for studying gene- environment interplay in middle and older age through harmonization of these data sets. The aim was to understand how social factors across the lifespan are associated with physical (subjective health, chronic medical illness co-morbidity, functional ability), psychologicl and cognitive health outcomes, particularly in later life. Building on our preliminary results, the proposed work for the next funding cycle focuses on health disparities in aging, in particular, disparities related to socioeconomic status and sex. Health disparities, which have been targeted by Healthy People 2020 as a public health priority, present as paradoxes. SES disparities in aging outcomes, rather than being diminished, have actually been amplified even in modern welfare states with relatively low levels of income inequality and high levels of access to health care. Sex disparities are illustrated by men's shorter lifespans typified by a higher prevalence of acute conditions and women's longer lifespans characterized by a greater chronic disease burden, including higher prevalence of dementia. Through use of the twin design, we propose to identify contextual and individual environmental sources of disparities (differences in exposures and behaviors) and identify how these work in combination with genetic influences (differences in vulnerability). For example, what behaviors and exposures mediate SES disparities? Does high SES buffer genetic influences on health outcomes? Is women's higher rate of disorder due to more years to accumulate adverse exposures, differences in amount of exposure, sex differences in physiological vulnerability to the disorder, or differential genetic o physiological vulnerability to specific exposures compared to men? The answers have implications for how to intervene to reduce disease burden. To evaluate these explanations, we will use co-twin control/within pair models, biometric moderation models, biometric sex limitation models, and polygenic risk scores from genotyping completed during the first funding cycle. Across the 15 twin studies, there are nearly 52,000 individual twins. Within this sample are over 6900 identical twin pairs for within pair difference models, and over 12,500 dizygotic twin pairs including nearly 4000 opposite sex pairs, allowing for testing of hypotheses about sex-specific genetic and environmental influences. The consortium thus uniquely has the sample sizes necessary for the proposed research agenda. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The central goal of the proposed work is to address the nature of aging health disparities through examination of socioeconomic status and sex. Bringing together 15 longitudinal twin studies of aging, including rich genotype data on a large subsample, provides a powerful tool for teasing apart the roles of environmental risk and genetic vulnerability in accounting for differential aging outcomes in cognitive health, physical health, and emotional health. Results will contribute to a clearer understanding of the mechanisms underlying health and disease, which in turn comprise the empirical foundation necessary for designing programs and policies toward achieving health equity.",Gene-Environment Interplay of Social Contexts and Aging-Related Outcomes,9340821,R56AG037985,"['Accounting ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Australia ', ' Behavior ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Buffers ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Denmark ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Finland ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"A Longitudinal Study of Endocrine Disruptor Mixtures and Reproductive Aging Project Summary/Abstract Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is widespread and these compounds can persist in the environment and the human body over decades. The population is aging, and women, in particular, can experience significant morbidity and diminished quality of life with aging. Recent epidemiologic data suggest that the timing of reproductive aging (the gradual decline in ovarian function with age) and the pattern of hormonal change during the menopausal transition influence women’s risk of chronic disease and their long- term health with aging. While numerous studies have examined adverse reproductive health effects and exposure to EDCs, little is known about how EDCs affect the timing or process of reproductive aging. Further, most existing epidemiologic studies on this topic have been cross-sectional with studies of age-at-menopause based on recall, limiting causal inference. In addition, combined exposure to various EDCs and pollutant- pollutant interactions (mixtures), as well as low-dose and non-monotonic dose-responses have been rarely if at all addressed. The proposed new epidemiologic study in a multi-ethnic cohort of women seeks to better understand how EDCs exposure affects the timing and characteristics of reproductive aging. We propose 1) to assess associations between EDC exposure (polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated pesticides, brominated flame retardants, and perfluorinated compounds) and timing of reproductive aging, including age at menopause and duration of the menopausal transition; 2) to assess the association between EDC exposure and hormonal characteristics during the menopausal transition, including levels and patterns of change in estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, testosterone, sex-hormone binding globulin, and anti-Müllerian hormone; and 3) to examine the simultaneous effects of multiple EDCs and their interactions (mixture effects) on these reproductive aging outcomes using regression methods for high-dimensional covariates (multi-pollutant approaches). We will also explore effect modification by race/ethnicity and temporal variations in EDCs. We will capitalize on extensive phenotypic data and biospecimens collected for more than 15 years in an ongoing, large longitudinal cohort of women, the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (n=1,800 with a total of ~14,000 observations). This project addresses strategic priorities of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, including disease pathogenesis by combined environmental exposures, as well as environmental health disparities. We will address these issues using innovative analytic approaches likely to yield new insights on the study of pollution mixtures and human health. The knowledge gained from this research may guide disease prevention initiatives; enhance women’s health and wellbeing as they age; and reduce environmental health disparities. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because comprehensive evaluation of the impact of multiple EDCs on reproductive aging will further our understanding of how complex exposures to EDCs may accelerate, delay or disrupt reproductive aging during this critical life stage. Such information would help inform the critical timing of interventions to effectively prevent or reduce the risk of chronic diseases and premature mortality. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIEHS’s mission that discovers how EDC exposures affect women’s health with aging in order to promote healthy aging.",A Longitudinal Study of Endocrine Disruptor Mixtures and Reproductive Aging,9152903,R01ES026964,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Body Composition ', ' Body Size ', ' Weight Change ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Fire Retardants ', ' Flame Retardants ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Menopause ', ' early menopause ', ' Premature Menopause ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"The Longitudinal Aging Study in India DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) is a multidisciplinary, internationally harmonized panel study designed to be nationally representative of India's population aged 45 and older. LASI collects information conceptually comparable to that gathered by the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and its sister surveys in Asia, Europe, and elsewhere. LASI has brought innovations related to social connectedness, expectations, informal labor market activity, and pension participation. LASI also collects physical measures of health, including dried blood spot (DBS) specimens. Fieldwork for a four-state pilot study funded by the National Institute on Aging (1R21AG032572-01) was successfully implemented in late 2010. Building on the success of the LASI pilot survey, we will implement the first two waves of a large-scale, nationally representative panel survey on aging, health, and retirement in India, with sufficient statistical power to test hypotheses and make meaningful inferences at the national and (large) state level, and in key subpopulations. LASI will allow a better understanding of the determinants and consequences of India's population aging processes and will inform the design of appropriate evidence-based policies to address key challenges associated with population aging. Our public, internationally harmonized data will also allow for cross-national comparative studies on aging. We will field the full-scale, national LASI survey in 15 states, which together make up more than 90% of India's population. The survey instrument will be based on the pilot survey instrument, which was carefully designed to collect information compatible with other HRS-type surveys, while fully capturing key contextual characteristics of India. The target sample for LASI is non- institutionalized Indian residents aged 45 and older and their spouses (irrespective of age). We will draw 18,000 age-qualifying individuals from a stratified, multi-stage, area probability sampling design. Efforts are well unde way to raise additional, non-NIA/NIH funding to extend LASI coverage to India's smaller states and increase sample size and to thereby allow for a more extensive set of state-level inferences and cross-state comparisons. Wave 1 of LASI survey data will be collected in 2013-2014 through face-to-face interviews using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing. We will then develop and test a longitudinal survey instrument and methods that will be appropriate for follow-up waves, using the pilot sample. Based on the knowledge gained from Wave 1 and the longitudinal methods study using the pilot sample, we will implement Wave 2 in 2015- 2016. In the course of implementing Wave 2, we will seek to follow best practices from the Indonesia Family Life Study, which achieved a 6% attrition rate. Descriptive and analytic studies of the data will be performed, providing insights for scientific researchers and policy makers in India and beyond. De-identified and cleaned data will be made publicly available within one year of fieldwork completion, enabling scientists both within and outside India to use the rich LASI data. Through comparative studies, LASI will enrich scientific insights and policy development in countries besides India. In particular, LASI will provide new research opportunities in the United States and in countries that host comparable HRS-type surveys, such as China and Indonesia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) is proposed as a full-scale, national survey that will directly facilitate increased scientific investigation of the economic, social, and biological determinants and consequences of population aging in India. Internationally harmonized, de-identified panel data will be publicly available online, enabling cross-state analyses within India and cross-national comparison of the relationships among retirement, aging, and health.

"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: renewal 2014 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for competitive funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for the period 2014 - 2020. ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), and recruited 12,100 men and women aged 50 and above who were representative of the older population of England. ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with half of the funding coming from a consortium of UK Government Departments. This renewal request is to fund three waves of data collection - waves 7 (2014/15), 8 (2016/17), and 9 (2018/19) - and associated analyses. The central objective is to provide the high quality data necessary for an exploration of the dynamic relationships between health and functioning, economic position, social participation, wellbeing, cognitive function and health as people plan for, move into and progress beyond retirement. ELSA is a multidisciplinary study, involving the collection of economic, epidemiological, health, social, psychological, physiological and genetic data. The phase of data collection planned in this application will greatly increase the potential for longitudinal analyses so as to examine causal process.  The research agenda of this application is focused on the following broad issues that are important scientifically while also being relevant to policy: comparisons of trajectories of health and wellbeing in England, the USA, and other countries; the determinants of economic wellbeing in older age; the nature and timing of retirement and post-retirement labor market activity; the interaction between psychosocial, genetic, and biological determinants of health and mortality; cognitive functioning and its impact on decision making among older people; disability and the compression of morbidity; the implications of mild cognitive impairment for social, economic and subjective wellbeing; economic, social and health inequalities in an ageing population; social participation and social productivity at older ages; intergenerational relationships and generativity; and health care utilization and transitions to social care.  The specific objectives of the new proposal are to: 1.

"Linking 1940 U.S. Census Data to Five Modern Surveys of Health and Aging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will link records from the 1940 U.S. Census to records for respondents to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS); the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID); the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS); the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP); and the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). These ongoing longitudinal studies are the cornerstones of America's data infrastructure for interdisciplinary research on aging and the life course; physical and mental health, disability, and well-being; later-life work, economic well-being, and retirement; and end-of-life issues. A crucial limitation of these studies is that they contain little information about social, economic, family, neighborhood, and environmental circumstances in childhood and young adulthood. The sparse early-life information that is now available is usually collected retrospectively in later adulthood; the quality of these few retrospective reports is largely unknown. This serious limitation of these data hinders researchers' ability to study the long-term impacts of childhood and young adult circumstances and to understand how later-life outcomes are the result of cumulative life-course processes. Linking these studies to the 1940 U.S. Census will produce data infrastructure that vastly expands their analytic utility for a variety of substantive problem. This project involves (1) preparing and formatting data files containing respondents' identifying information; (2) deploying sophisticated machine linking algorithms to link the project records to the 1940 U.S. Census; (3) hand linking records that cannot be machine linked and hand-verifying a portion of those that can; (6) creating individual-, family-, and contextual/spatial-leel variables that are consistent with IPUMS and comparable across projects; (7) documenting the new measures and making them available as part of projects' restricted access dissemination systems in a manner consistent with respondents' privacy rights; (8) publicizing the resulting measures and conducting user outreach to maximize the utility and visibility of the new data resource; and (9) conducting methodological analyses to assess the validity of retrospective reports of childhood social and economic circumstances. The project will be led by a team from the Minnesota Population Center in collaboration with each projects' leadership team. The researchers have considerable expertise in the construction and analysis of longitudinal studies of health and aging and in historical record linkage using machine and hand linking techniques.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will substantially improve basic infrastructure for demographic, social scientific, and public health research on aging, retirement, health, mortality, economic circumstances, and well-being in later adulthood; it will transform our ability to understand the long-term impact of social, economic, genetic, demographic, neighborhood, contextual, and environmental circumstances and exposures in early life on any of the later-life outcomes observed in America's most important studies of health, aging, and retirement. The proposed work is directly relevant to the central mission of the NIH as the steward of medical and behavioral research for the nation: the resulting data will advance fundamental knowledge about population health and population dynamics and will spawn a new generation of research across disciplines.                ",Linking 1940 U.S. Census Data to Five Modern Surveys of Health and Aging,9040694,R01AG050300,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Burns ', ' Burn injury ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Coal ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Hand ', ' Household Heads ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Industry ', ' Labor Forces ', ' Leadership ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Marital Status ', ' Marriage ', ' age at marriage ', ' Marriage Ages ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Names ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Parents ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Birth Place ', ' Play ', ' Population Density ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Power Plants ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Rights ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' School Enrollments ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Social Marketing ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Tongue ', ' Veterans ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Privacy ', ' Family member ', ' Social Impacts ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Discipline ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Data Files ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Inequality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' grandparent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' health record ', ' Agreement ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Institution ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health research ', ' population health ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2016,610264,0.10694019790079831
"USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Advances in medicine and technology are providing for longer and healthier lives today. American families have increasingly been asked to take responsibility for their own health and financial outcomes: how long to work, how much to save, when to claim Social Security and pension benefits, which health plans to choose, and how to allocate and manage their assets. Navigating these complex choices may be particularly difficult for minority elderly, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Indeed, health indicators have demonstrated little improvement in health disparities between different racial and ethnic populations over the past decade, according to analyses in Healthy People 2010. Evidence also suggests that minority households tend to be excluded from or participate only on the margins of the financial mainstream. To this end we propose to establish a RCMAR at USC that will develop an infrastructure to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1. Provide leadership, organizational, communication and evaluation systems to achieve the overarching goal of supporting high-quality and enduring research careers in the health and economic challenges of minority elderly; 2. Support pilot study solicitation and selection process to ensure the selection of scientifically rigorous and fundable pilot projects and enhancement of the diversity of researchers; 3. Support pilot-funded investigators through achievement of pilot studies goals and award of an independent grant by multidisciplinary mentoring and training in the methods and tools of economics, computer science, medicine, and social work; 4. Analyze large longitudinal survey data sets and medical claims data on the health, medical care and expenditures, economic status, and financial decisions of diverse elderly populations in order to generate interventions that will address health and economic disparities; 5. Track and evaluate the successes of pilot investigators and data analysis and improve the infrastructure support in accordance with evaluation findings. This proposed RCMAR is a collaboration between USC and RAND that utilizes the resources of USC's Roybal Center on Health Policy Simulation, Roybal Institute on Aging, Alzheimer Disease Research Center, and RAND's Roybal Center for Financial Decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the health and economics issues associated with the aging process are of such magnitude and complexity that they cannot be approached from the vantage point of any single discipline alone. With the National Institute on Aging's Priority Area for RCMAR Centers comes a pressing need to build infrastructure that will bring a multidisciplinary approach to the health and economic challenges of minority elderly and have a long-lasting effect on research in this area.",USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR),9293579,P30AG043073,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Household ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Retirement Benefits ', ' Pensions ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Savings ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' American ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' simulation ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Process ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' financial decision making ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,P30,2016,164993,0.0991894194982518
"Biodemography of Aging in Wild Chimpanzees DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While it is clear that lifespan was extended during human evolution, there is remarkably little data available to assess the specific ways by which this remarkable change in life history came about. This missing information could importantly inform the understanding of how modern lifestyles, in interaction with our evolved biology, produce the health outcomes observed in developed countries. A major limitation at present is a dearth of data on the aging process in humans' closest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee. The current study would be the first to gather comprehensive data on aging in wild chimpanzees, whose health has not been manipulated by humans during captive management or biomedical experimentation. Like humans during most of their evolutionary history, wild chimpanzees experience frequent nutritional stress and high rates of infectious disease and these processes - little studied in modern aging research - are expected to have shaped species-normative life history strategies. The project entails non-invasive collection of urine and feces from approximately 245 wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) for a broad range of health biomarkers, in additional to observational research for observed morbidity, locomotor proficiency, and social behavior. New data collection will complement and extend existing long-term demographic data, as well as individual histories of social interaction and reproductive effort. The wild data will be supplemented by additional blood-based biomarkers obtained during routine veterinary immobilizations of approximately 240 semi-free ranging chimpanzees in African sanctuaries. The project integrates investigators from major studies of health and aging in human foraging populations, and the central aim (1) of the project is to perform structured comparisons of health and aging between humans and chimpanzees. To further this goal, the additional project aims focus on key variables that are expected to shape senescence, and which are associated with prominent behavioral differences between species: (2) sex differences and the allocation of reproductive effort across the life history, (3) stability of accss to energy, and (4) social status and support. Information gathered in pursuit of these aims has specific relevance to prominent focuses of human aging research: the gender morbidity-mortality paradox, caloric restriction, and the influences of chronic stress and social subordination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern human aging and mortality patterns result from a combination of our modern lifestyle and our evolved patterns of senescence and repair. While there is excellent information on the former, very little is understood about the processes affecting the evolution of the unusual human lifespan. The current study quantifies aging patterns in wild chimpanzees and incorporates specific comparisons with traditional human populations in order to elucidate key mechanisms of evolutionary change from our ape ancestors.",Biodemography of Aging in Wild Chimpanzees,9137630,R01AG049395,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Animals ', ' Biology ', ' Bolivia ', ' Chimpanzee troglodytes ', ' Pan troglodytes ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Immobilization ', ' Infection ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' great ape ', ' Apes ', ' Pongidae ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Tanzania ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Pan Species ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Chimp ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' species difference ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Funding ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' fighting ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' interest ', ' information gathering ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' life history ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' Social status ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' reproductive ', ' Sampling ', ' Habitats ', ' calorie restriction ', ' calorie restricted ', ' calorically restricted ', ' caloric restricted ', ' Caloric Restriction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' urinary ', ' Behavioral ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' comparative ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biodemography ', ' reproductive senescence ', ' spermatozoal senescence ', ' spermatozoa senescence ', ' sperm senescence ', ' sperm cell senescence ', ' reproductive cell senescence ', ' reproductive aging ', ' ovulatory senescence ', ' ovarian senescence ', ' study population ', ' Cardiac health ', ' Heart health ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' blood-based biomarker ', ' blood-based marker ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,R01,2016,571040,0.14758530275866813
"Advancing aging research through development of minority gerontologists DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of establishing the Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR) program at Howard University (HUADAR) is to identify a group of bright minority students from MSTEM disciplines early during their undergraduate years and then through extensive mentoring and training prepare them to successfully compete for graduate studies and other professional careers. By making them familiar with aging research early in their career, this cadre of minority researchers could be made squarely interested about building a career on geriatrics and gerontology. The Rationales for developing an HUADAR program is quite justifiable, for more than a century Howard University is engaged in training underrepresented minority students. About 97% of Howard's mentees are African Americans and National Science Foundation's (NSF) recent ranking put Howard University as the top producer of bachelor's degree recipients who subsequently earned science and engineering doctoral degrees nationally from top-tier research universities. Moreover, with an aggressive recruitment effort, Howard University successfully recruited several faculty members in MSTEM areas who are maintaining an active research programs on various aspects of aging and age related disorders. Therefore, Howard University has the ideal environment to identify a cadre of talented minority scientists early during their undergraduate years and it has the required resources to provide them with a foundation of knowledge and research skills through mentoring so that these students will excel in the interdisciplinary field of gerontology. Trainee compositio for HUADAR program will include 100% underrepresented minorities. Approximately 7,000 undergraduate students enroll at Howard in 29 undergraduate departments and programs, approximately 97% of enrollees are African American and 67% are women. Furthermore, 20% (or 1,400) major in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering and Allied Health with greater than 80% declaring medicine as their career goal. We plan to recruit five students from MSTEM disciplines each year by selecting them early at the end of their freshman year using a recruitment strategy which includes: a) identification of strong performing students in the introductory courses, b) students enrolled in the Honors Program, c) recommendations by faculty members, and d) students responding to advertisements, announcements, and oral presentations. Proposed training is a comprehensive research education plan designed for HUADAR trainees which consists of following components: (1) develop two new courses on aging, (2) exposure to aging research in various laboratories at Howard during sophomore and junior years, (3) attending research seminars by prominent gerontologists, (4) a summer research apprenticeship opportunity outside Howard University in leading research institutes on aging like NIA Baltimore, UT Health Sciences Center, Johns Hopkins, Georgetown University Medical Centers, University of Maryland and University of Washington, (5) writing a honors thesis/senior thesis during senior year, (6) provide one on one mentoring to build a successful career path. Thus, from their sophomore year up to the senior year we have a carefully laid out plans to educate the HUADAR trainees on different aspects of aging research including the social aspects of aging. All students and personnel will be required to participate in instruction on the Responsible Conduct of Research. Evaluation plan for HUADAR will consist of course evaluations, student performances, faculty efficacy surveys, summer research experience surveys, successful completion of an honors thesis/senior thesis. The long-term goal of HUADAR program is to prepare minority students as future researchers through scientific training and educational experiences and we will encourage them to seek aging research as a career goal. Thus we will embrace the goal of NIA ADAR initiative to ""fill a gap in the pipeline transitioning from undergraduate to graduate education in aging as it relates to medicine, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to fulfill the objectives of the NIA Health Disparities Strategic Plan"". PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By 2030 we will be living in an America with 1 in 5 American 65 years or older. The ethnic minority portion of our population is growing at an amazing pace from 4.3 million persons in 1990 to 22.5 million expected by the year 2050. This nation needs to be prepared to deal with ethnically diverse minority elderlies who will account for more than 15% of older persons by 2020 and more than 21% of older persons by 2050. Since health disparity among the ethnically diverse minority population is real and we have to deal with it immediately. Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR) is an attempt to identify a cadre of minority scientists early during their undergraduate years, provide them with a foundation of knowledge and research skills through mentoring so these students will excel in the interdisciplinary field o gerontology. With this conviction, this proposal lay out a detail research education plan to establish an ADAR program at Howard University called HUADAR. In the long term HUADAR trainees will create culturally sensitive health measures to assess the health status of minority elders with greater precision.",Advancing aging research through development

"The Longitudinal Aging Study in India DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) is a multidisciplinary, internationally harmonized panel study designed to be nationally representative of India's population aged 45 and older. LASI collects information conceptually comparable to that gathered by the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and its sister surveys in Asia, Europe, and elsewhere. LASI has brought innovations related to social connectedness, expectations, informal labor market activity, and pension participation. LASI also collects physical measures of health, including dried blood spot (DBS) specimens. Fieldwork for a four-state pilot study funded by the National Institute on Aging (1R21AG032572-01) was successfully implemented in late 2010. Building on the success of the LASI pilot survey, we will implement the first two waves of a large-scale, nationally representative panel survey on aging, health, and retirement in India, with sufficient statistical power to test hypotheses and make meaningful inferences at the national and (large) state level, and in key subpopulations. LASI will allow a better understanding of the determinants and consequences of India's population aging processes and will inform the design of appropriate evidence-based policies to address key challenges associated with population aging. Our public, internationally harmonized data will also allow for cross-national comparative studies on aging. We will field the full-scale, national LASI survey in 15 states, which together make up more than 90% of India's population. The survey instrument will be based on the pilot survey instrument, which was carefully designed to collect information compatible with other HRS-type surveys, while fully capturing key contextual characteristics of India. The target sample for LASI is non- institutionalized Indian residents aged 45 and older and their spouses (irrespective of age). We will draw 18,000 age-qualifying individuals from a stratified, multi-stage, area probability sampling design. Efforts are well unde way to raise additional, non-NIA/NIH funding to extend LASI coverage to India's smaller states and increase sample size and to thereby allow for a more extensive set of state-level inferences and cross-state comparisons. Wave 1 of LASI survey data will be collected in 2013-2014 through face-to-face interviews using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing. We will then develop and test a longitudinal survey instrument and methods that will be appropriate for follow-up waves, using the pilot sample. Based on the knowledge gained from Wave 1 and the longitudinal methods study using the pilot sample, we will implement Wave 2 in 2015- 2016. In the course of implementing Wave 2, we will seek to follow best practices from the Indonesia Family Life Study, which achieved a 6% attrition rate. Descriptive and analytic studies of the data will be performed, providing insights for scientific researchers and policy makers in India and beyond. De-identified and cleaned data will be made publicly available within one year of fieldwork completion, enabling scientists both within and outside India to use the rich LASI data. Through comparative studies, LASI will enrich scientific insights and policy development in countries besides India. In particular, LASI will provide new research opportunities in the United States and in countries that host comparable HRS-type surveys, such as China and Indonesia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) is proposed as a full-scale, national survey that will directly facilitate increased scientific investigation of the economic, social, and biological determinants and consequences of population aging in India. Internationally harmonized, de-identified panel data will be publicly available online, enabling cross-state analyses within India and cross-national comparison of the relationships among retirement, aging, and health.

"Linking 1940 U.S. Census Data to Five Modern Surveys of Health and Aging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will link records from the 1940 U.S. Census to records for respondents to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS); the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID); the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS); the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP); and the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). These ongoing longitudinal studies are the cornerstones of America's data infrastructure for interdisciplinary research on aging and the life course; physical and mental health, disability, and well-being; later-life work, economic well-being, and retirement; and end-of-life issues. A crucial limitation of these studies is that they contain little information about social, economic, family, neighborhood, and environmental circumstances in childhood and young adulthood. The sparse early-life information that is now available is usually collected retrospectively in later adulthood; the quality of these few retrospective reports is largely unknown. This serious limitation of these data hinders researchers' ability to study the long-term impacts of childhood and young adult circumstances and to understand how later-life outcomes are the result of cumulative life-course processes. Linking these studies to the 1940 U.S. Census will produce data infrastructure that vastly expands their analytic utility for a variety of substantive problem. This project involves (1) preparing and formatting data files containing respondents' identifying information; (2) deploying sophisticated machine linking algorithms to link the project records to the 1940 U.S. Census; (3) hand linking records that cannot be machine linked and hand-verifying a portion of those that can; (6) creating individual-, family-, and contextual/spatial-leel variables that are consistent with IPUMS and comparable across projects; (7) documenting the new measures and making them available as part of projects' restricted access dissemination systems in a manner consistent with respondents' privacy rights; (8) publicizing the resulting measures and conducting user outreach to maximize the utility and visibility of the new data resource; and (9) conducting methodological analyses to assess the validity of retrospective reports of childhood social and economic circumstances. The project will be led by a team from the Minnesota Population Center in collaboration with each projects' leadership team. The researchers have considerable expertise in the construction and analysis of longitudinal studies of health and aging and in historical record linkage using machine and hand linking techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will substantially improve basic infrastructure for demographic, social scientific, and public health research on aging, retirement, health, mortality, economic circumstances, and well-being in later adulthood; it will transform our ability to understand the long-term impact of social, economic, genetic, demographic, neighborhood, contextual, and environmental circumstances and exposures in early life on any of the later-life outcomes observed in America's most important studies of health, aging, and retirement. The proposed work is directly relevant to the central mission of the NIH as the steward of medical and behavioral research for the nation: the resulting data will advance fundamental knowledge about population health and population dynamics and will spawn a new generation of research across disciplines.",Linking 1940 U.S. Census Data to Five Modern Surveys of Health and Aging,9206131,R01AG050300,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Coal ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Hand ', ' Household Heads ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Industry ', ' Labor Forces ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Marital Status ', ' Marriage ', ' Marriage Ages ', ' age at marriage ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methodology ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mission ', ' Modernization ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Parents ', ' Birth Place ', ' Play ', ' Population Density ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Power Plants ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Retirement ', ' Rights ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' School Enrollments ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tongue ', ' Veterans ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Privacy ', ' Family member ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Discipline ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Data Files ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Inequality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' grandparent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' health record ', ' Agreement ', ' economic impact ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Institution ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' data format ', ' public health research ', ' population health ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' data resource ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2017,588161,0.10694019790079831
"Psychosocial Context and the Biological Clock: Changes in Weathering during Middle-Age PROJECT SUMMARY  Unprecedented growth in the proportion of older adults in the U.S. has placed inequalities in healthy aging at the forefront of the public health agenda. Individuals often differ dramatically in their speed of aging. Some demonstrate accelerated aging and suffer early onset of chronic illness whereas others manifest decelerated aging and stave off serious illness well into their 90s. In recent years, researchers have made much headway in understanding the molecular markers of healthy aging, thereby allowing for earlier identification of risk for chronic disease. The proposed research focuses on two such biomarkers of healthy aging – inflammatory aging and methylomic aging. These measures provide us with “biological clocks” that are strongly predictive of age-related physiological decline, disease, and mortality. Having established these molecular measures of the speed of aging, the important question for social scientists and health policy now becomes: To what extent is the speed of aging malleable, for better or worse, in response to natural shifts in psychosocial contexts? This question is the focus of the present proposal. We plan to investigate the extent to which adult social conditions from various domains, but especially those operating within the family, influence speed of biological aging after taking into account childhood experiences and potentially confounding life style factors such as diet, exercise, and smoking. Our objective is to identify the stressors that accelerate aging as well as the supports that decelerate aging. These goals will be pursued using longitudinal data from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS), a 20-year study of well-being among African American mothers, their romantic partners (RPs), and their offspring. A focus on aging among African Americans is important as they tend to suffer from earlier onset and higher prevalence of age-related diseases and a wider range of psychosocial stressors than other ethnic groups. First, we will obtain longitudinal indices of the speed of inflammatory and methylomic aging from the now middle-aged mothers and, if partnered, their RPs by collecting and assaying a new wave of blood data, as well as assaying stored blood from a previous wave. The proposed data will provide the first comprehensive assessment of change in the speed or rate of biological aging during adulthood. Second, we will collect an additional wave of interview data so that changes in supports and stressors can be mapped onto changes in the rate of biological aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Improving the quality of longer lives requires better specified models of healthy aging. Our objective is to identify the stressors that accelerate as well as the supports that decelerate the rate of biological aging.

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole.

"NATIONAL HEALTH AND AGING TRENDS STUDY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to continue the National Health and Aging Trend Study (NHATS), which aims (1) to promote scientific inquiry into late-life disability trends and dynamics, their antecedents and correlates, and disparities therein and (2) to advance study of the social and economic consequences of late-life disability for individuals, families, and society. To achieve these aims, in the next 5-year cycle (2014-2018) we will: (a) Collect data in person from the original NHATS cohort annually, including: continued collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; collection of dried blood spots, some to be assayed to foster study of the biologic risk for disability progression, and others to be stored for future use; enhancements to the NHATS interview in key understudied areas of potentially growing importance-use of rehabilitation services aimed at recovery from disability, and the service environment and related amenities that promote independent functioning in retirement and senior community settings-and incorporating new modules submitted by the broader research community. (b) Replenish the sample in Round 5 (2015). Replenishment will be implemented in such a way that NHATS maintains the ability to produce 5-year age estimates (including 90+) and Black-White comparisons. (c) Clean, document and disseminate public use files online and continue to make Medicare claims and other sensitive and restricted files available using established procedures. (d) Undertake methodological studies to improve the efficiency of data collection in future rounds, including testing the sensitivity of key estimates to differential follow-up periods and applying modern measurement approaches such as Item Response Theory (IRT) to measures of capacity. The overarching goal of NHATS is to be a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life. Research using NHATS will foster research to design multi-factor interventions to reduce late-life disability, and will support comprehensive modeling of outcomes of the disability process including living and care arrangements, expenditures, economic well-being, and quality of life.

"Advancing aging research through development of minority gerontologists DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of establishing the Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR) program at Howard University (HUADAR) is to identify a group of bright minority students from MSTEM disciplines early during their undergraduate years and then through extensive mentoring and training prepare them to successfully compete for graduate studies and other professional careers. By making them familiar with aging research early in their career, this cadre of minority researchers could be made squarely interested about building a career on geriatrics and gerontology. The Rationales for developing an HUADAR program is quite justifiable, for more than a century Howard University is engaged in training underrepresented minority students. About 97% of Howard's mentees are African Americans and National Science Foundation's (NSF) recent ranking put Howard University as the top producer of bachelor's degree recipients who subsequently earned science and engineering doctoral degrees nationally from top-tier research universities. Moreover, with an aggressive recruitment effort, Howard University successfully recruited several faculty members in MSTEM areas who are maintaining an active research programs on various aspects of aging and age related disorders. Therefore, Howard University has the ideal environment to identify a cadre of talented minority scientists early during their undergraduate years and it has the required resources to provide them with a foundation of knowledge and research skills through mentoring so that these students will excel in the interdisciplinary field of gerontology. Trainee compositio for HUADAR program will include 100% underrepresented minorities. Approximately 7,000 undergraduate students enroll at Howard in 29 undergraduate departments and programs, approximately 97% of enrollees are African American and 67% are women. Furthermore, 20% (or 1,400) major in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering and Allied Health with greater than 80% declaring medicine as their career goal. We plan to recruit five students from MSTEM disciplines each year by selecting them early at the end of their freshman year using a recruitment strategy which includes: a) identification of strong performing students in the introductory courses, b) students enrolled in the Honors Program, c) recommendations by faculty members, and d) students responding to advertisements, announcements, and oral presentations. Proposed training is a comprehensive research education plan designed for HUADAR trainees which consists of following components: (1) develop two new courses on aging, (2) exposure to aging research in various laboratories at Howard during sophomore and junior years, (3) attending research seminars by prominent gerontologists, (4) a summer research apprenticeship opportunity outside Howard University in leading research institutes on aging like NIA Baltimore, UT Health Sciences Center, Johns Hopkins, Georgetown University Medical Centers, University of Maryland and University of Washington, (5) writing a honors thesis/senior thesis during senior year, (6) provide one on one mentoring to build a successful career path. Thus, from their sophomore year up to the senior year we have a carefully laid out plans to educate the HUADAR trainees on different aspects of aging research including the social aspects of aging. All students and personnel will be required to participate in instruction on the Responsible Conduct of Research. Evaluation plan for HUADAR will consist of course evaluations, student performances, faculty efficacy surveys, summer research experience surveys, successful completion of an honors thesis/senior thesis. The long-term goal of HUADAR program is to prepare minority students as future researchers through scientific training and educational experiences and we will encourage them to seek aging research as a career goal. Thus we will embrace the goal of NIA ADAR initiative to ""fill a gap in the pipeline transitioning from undergraduate to graduate education in aging as it relates to medicine, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to fulfill the objectives of the NIA Health Disparities Strategic Plan"". PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By 2030 we will be living in an America with 1 in 5 American 65 years or older. The ethnic minority portion of our population is growing at an amazing pace from 4.3 million persons in 1990 to 22.5 million expected by the year 2050. This nation needs to be prepared to deal with ethnically diverse minority elderlies who will account for more than 15% of older persons by 2020 and more than 21% of older persons by 2050. Since health disparity among the ethnically diverse minority population is real and we have to deal with it immediately. Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR) is an attempt to identify a cadre of minority scientists early during their undergraduate years, provide them with a foundation of knowledge and research skills through mentoring so these students will excel in the interdisciplinary field o gerontology. With this conviction, this proposal lay out a detail research education plan to establish an ADAR program at Howard University called HUADAR. In the long term HUADAR trainees will create culturally sensitive health measures to assess the health status of minority elders with greater precision.",Advancing aging research through development

"South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research Undergraduate Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of South Carolina (USC) proposes to establish a South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (SC-ADAR) undergraduate program to increase the number of qualified underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students who pursue scientific graduate studies in programs focusing on science and aging. We are partnering with five Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in South Carolina (SC). The decision to focus on HBCUs was made as HBCUs have a high concentration of low-income, African American undergraduate students, many of whom are majoring in MSTEM fields, and might, through exposure to a research education program focusing on aging research, choose to enter scientific careers committed to addressing the complex biological, biomedical, behavioral, and clinical challenges that accompany aging. The proposed SC-ADAR leverages the Dual PIs' and USC's extensive experience in providing training in aging and MSTEM research for underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students across the continuum of education, from high-school through graduate school and further professional advancement. In addition, the proposed program will draw on USC's long history of collaborating with South Carolina's HBCUs in the development of educational programs for undergraduates in the STEM fields. Specific program aims include: 1) recruiting HBCU undergraduates majoring in STEM fields from five participating HBCUs in SC; 2) implementing a 24-month research education program, including: hands-on mentored research experiences in a research laboratory at USC; co-mentoring system with USC and HBCU faculty; summer coursework on aging; opportunities for joint-learning with other students; academic advising; and career/professional development activities that will assist students in applying to graduate studies in NIA MSTEM fields and professional development activities that will assist HBCU faculty mentors in career advancement in NIA MSTEM research; 3) conducting a process evaluation (to make iterative improvements in the program) and a summative evaluation to measure short-term outcomes (competencies in NIH MSTEM fields and completion of undergraduate degree in MSTEM field) and intermediate-term outcomes (application and transitioning to graduate studies/medical school); and 4) evaluating the success of the program in increasing the capacity and intention of HBCU faculty mentors to conduct research in NIA MSTEM fields. The likelihood of success is enhanced by strong institutional support from USC, USC's existing infrastructure for advancing diversity in STEM, and through the experience of the Dual PIs, with their backgrounds in research training in aging (Dr. Sue Levkoff) and the STEM (Dr. Alan White) fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed SC-ADAR institutional Research Education program seeks to address the lack of diversity among scientific experts in the aging field as well as the need for expanded basic and clinical research on health disparities among the aging population. Success in attaining the program aims will contribute to our long-term goal of attaining a diverse workforce of basic and clinical scientists to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse and older population.",South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research Undergraduate Program,9273348,R25AG050484,"['Aging ', ' career transition ', ' career advancement ', ' Career Mobility ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Graduate Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' South Carolina ', ' Students ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' educationally disadvantaged ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' social ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', "" Bachelor's Degree "", ' Undergraduate Degree ', ' Baccalaureate Degree ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Older Population ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' public health relevance ', ' STEM field ', ' STEM major ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM class ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ', ' undergraduate education ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Academic advising ', ' Educational counseling ', ' Admissions Counseling ', ' Academic guidance ', ' Academic counseling ', ' faculty mentor ', ' matriculation ', ' education research ', ' Diverse Workforce ', ' Workplace Diversity ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' minority student ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R25,2017,352650,0.10127148386590482
"Enhancing Leadership Capacity to Mentor Scientists in Translational Behavioral AD-Related Research Project Summary Community-engaged research, focusing on patient-centered outcomes (PCO), is critical in translating scientific evidence into health benefits for the aging US population. There’s limited focus on understanding associations of sleep with brain health and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among older adults, particularly minorities who are disproportionately burdened by Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Consistent with the NIH roadmap of translating research into practice, it is paramount that health professionals be trained to pursue careers in PCO that promote healthy aging. The K07 leadership award will serve as (a) a collaborative learning laboratory and (b) a resource to stimulate, support, and evaluate high-priority translational aging research in diverse communities. It will coalesce a network of renowned investigators to tackle adverse sleep-related CVD outcomes in a diverse aging population. It will also address a critical deficiency in the academic workforce by mentoring junior scientists to pursue careers in translational behavioral research and to become effective mentors. The plan builds upon Dr. Jean-Louis’ leadership in implementing community research and mentoring programs. Its strong likelihood of success is anchored by his outstanding experience engaging multiple stakeholders supporting aging-related research initiatives. The K07 plan will be implemented in an outstanding academic environment for translational behavioral research. It leverages several NYU resources, particularly those of the CTSI, the Center for Healthful Behavior Change, the Center for Brain Health, and the Sleep Disorders Center. Other enhancements to this environment include: 1) a community-academic partnership with a shared aging research agenda aiming to address important health needs of older adults, 2) access to a pool of 83 PRIDE scientists who will be coached to become Peer Mentors, and 3) Dr. Jean-Louis’ leadership in a new fellowship program in translational behavioral sciences in NYU’s Department of Population Health. Dr. Jean-Louis’ research program comprises several trials ascertaining effectiveness of tailored interventions to increase adoption of sleep health messages. These are complemented by use of mix-methods approaches to study psychosocial and cultural factors affecting health practices in diverse communities. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Provide a forum in which mid- to senior-level investigators in aging research will congregate to forge interdisciplinary collaborations, leading to submission of innovative research proposals; 2) Select and mentor 12 postdoctoral URM scientists with potential to become innovative and creative leaders in the scientific community, applying translational behavioral models to promote healthy aging; and 3) Coach 12 scientists who recently graduated from NYU’s PRIDE Institute to become Peer Mentors. This award will have a strong impact in increasing the academic workforce in sleep and ethnogerontological research. Project Narrative The K07 leadership award will coalesce a network of renowned investigators to tackle pressing adverse sleep-related CVD and brain health outcomes in a diverse aging population, with a focus on those with Alzheimer’s disease.

"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: renewal 2014 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for competitive funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for the period 2014 - 2020. ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), and recruited 12,100 men and women aged 50 and above who were representative of the older population of England. ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with half of the funding coming from a consortium of UK Government Departments. This renewal request is to fund three waves of data collection - waves 7 (2014/15), 8 (2016/17), and 9 (2018/19) - and associated analyses. The central objective is to provide the high quality data necessary for an exploration of the dynamic relationships between health and functioning, economic position, social participation, wellbeing, cognitive function and health as people plan for, move into and progress beyond retirement. ELSA is a multidisciplinary study, involving the collection of economic, epidemiological, health, social, psychological, physiological and genetic data. The phase of data collection planned in this application will greatly increase the potential for longitudinal analyses so as to examine causal process.  The research agenda of this application is focused on the following broad issues that are important scientifically while also being relevant to policy: comparisons of trajectories of health and wellbeing in England, the USA, and other countries; the determinants of economic wellbeing in older age; the nature and timing of retirement and post-retirement labor market activity; the interaction between psychosocial, genetic, and biological determinants of health and mortality; cognitive functioning and its impact on decision making among older people; disability and the compression of morbidity; the implications of mild cognitive impairment for social, economic and subjective wellbeing; economic, social and health inequalities in an ageing population; social participation and social productivity at older ages; intergenerational relationships and generativity; and health care utilization and transitions to social care.  The specific objectives of the new proposal are to: 1. Design the survey instruments for further waves data collection, building on the existing data from these respondents and maximizing comparability with HRS and other studies 2.

"Metabolic and Inflammatory Pathways of Midlife Neurocognitive Disparities Project Summary/Abstract Health is not randomly distributed across people or across space: it tracks a socioeconomic gradient that extends from individuals to the areas in which they live. Individual- and area-level attributes of socioeconomic disadvantage confer risk for a broad range of interrelated physical and neurocognitive health outcomes. This risk is especially apparent in midlife when pathophysiological trajectories of neurocognitive aging that predict risk for dementia in later life begin to accelerate. In this regard, we have provided some of the first evidence that individual- and area- level socioeconomic disadvantage associate with reduced cortical tissue volume and white matter integrity, aspects of brain morphology that show normative shrinkage and integrity loss with age in association with poorer cognitive outcomes. Pathways linking socioeconomic disadvantage to accelerated neurocognitive aging remain unclear. Recent evidence, including our own, suggests that metabolic factors may play a role. Individuals who develop metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for accelerated neurocognitive aging. Furthermore, our recent cross-sectional findings suggest that metabolic risk factors contribute to the associations of area-level disadvantage with brain morphology among midlife adults. Here, we aim to extend this work by longitudinally examining metabolic pathways linking individual- and area-level disadvantage to neurocognitive aging across a 10 year period of midlife. For this purpose, we propose reassessing a sample of 300 cognitively normal midlife adults on whom we collected baseline measures of socioeconomic parameters, metabolic risk, brain morphology and cognitive function 9-10 years ago (mean age at follow-up = 52). Our primary aims examine whether individual- and area-level measures of socioeconomic disadvantage predict changes in brain morphology and cognitive function that decline with age and whether associations of disadvantage with neurocognitive aging are explained by metabolic risk and associated inflammation. We anticipate that this study will contribute to new knowledge to the neurobiology of disparities in cognitive aging. Project Narrative As the US population ages, cognitive impairment is becoming a rising and intractable problem, particularly for individuals at relative socioeconomic disadvantage who are at increased risk for premature neurocognitive aging and dementia. The public health implications of the proposed research include the potential to identify modifiable risk factors that track a socioeconomic gradient and predict preclinical cognitive decline across mid-life, a period when differential trajectories of cognitive aging begin. The project focus is on metabolic risk factors that associate with disadvantage and may accelerate preclinical brain aging and cognitive decline.",Metabolic and Inflammatory Pathways of Midlife

"Healthcare stereotype threat, health disparities, and minority aging PROJECT SUMMARY Health disparities among aging African Americans and Latinos are substantial and persistent. 1 With large segments of these populations living in poverty, healthcare access and quality are major contributors to their disproportionate burdens of disease, disability, and death. Yet, African American and Latino later life health disparities persist even in higher socioeconomic contexts. 2 This suggests that, in addition to economic barriers, there are psychosocial barriers to healthcare resource use, or utilization, and, thus, good health among aging minorities. The purpose of the proposed career development and research is to provide new understanding of later life health disparities by examining a previously overlooked psychosocial barrier to care among aging minorities, namely healthcare stereotype threat (HCST), 3-9 and how it can be ameliorated. Stereotype threat is the threat of being personally reduced to a group stereotype, 10-13 which can lead individuals to avoid stereotype-relevant domains. 10-12 For example, females have been shown to avoid STEM fields, leadership roles, and other stereotypically male domains to avoid stereotypes of inferiority and their negative social and psychological consequences. 14,15 My central hypothesis is that stereotypes regarding unhealthy lifestyles, low status, and inferior intelligence are salient for aging minorities in healthcare settings and influence healthcare resource use and health outcomes. The first of its kind, the proposed research will investigate the research questions of whether and how HCST contributes to disparities in healthcare resource use and health in aging African Americans and Latinos as compared to Whites. The approach is informed by Stereotype Threat Theory3,9,10,16,17 and my Culture and Social Identity Health Theory. 18 Specific Aims are threefold: (1) To document the association of ethnicity/race-based and age-based HCST to cross- sectional and longitudinal healthcare resource use and health outcomes among African American, Latino, and White older adults; (2) To use randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine economic and other moderators of the link between HCST and perceptions of the healthcare environment, including healthcare resource quality; and (3) To use RCT to examine how matching patients and physicians on race/ethnicity and/or age impacts the association between HCST and perceptions of healthcare resource quality. The proposed research design consists of three studies, employs a combination of survey and experimental methods, and involves both primary data collection and secondary data analysis. An assistant professor of Gerontology and Psychology at the University of Southern California, I (Candidate: Abdou) possess interdisciplinary expertise in psychology, social epidemiology, population health, and lifespan and intergenerational health disparities. This NIA K01 will provide the unique opportunity to augment my current expertise with training in health economics, health services research, and advanced training in stereotype threat and statistical and research methods (i.e., longitudinal data, RCT). Alongside my strong interdisciplinary mentorship team, I will receive the necessary support and training to work toward my long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program, including development of a successful NIH R01, to reduce later life health disparities and improve minority aging through the reduction of HCST and its sociocultural and psychobiological consequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research and training are aligned with NIA priorities, the NIH mission, and U.S. Healthy People 2020 goals to improve quantity and quality of life for all people. Expected positive impacts include the creation of stereotype-safer healthcare environments and the reduction of health disparities among aging minorities.","Healthcare stereotype threat, health disparities, and minority aging",9386603,K01AG051756,"['Accounting ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Anxiety ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Medical Education ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' male ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Institutional Policy ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' Inferior ', ' intergenerational ', ' professor ', ' novel ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' psychobiologic ', ' psychobiological ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' disability burden ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' Medicare claim ', ' health equity ', ' health inequalities ', ' population health ', ' STEM field ', ' STEM major ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM class ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' unhealthy lifestyle ', ' trial design ', ' racial minority ', ' ethnic identity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K01,2017,129492,0.10839371892939542
"USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Advances in medicine and technology are providing for longer and healthier lives today. American families have increasingly been asked to take responsibility for their own health and financial outcomes: how long to work, how much to save, when to claim Social Security and pension benefits, which health plans to choose, and how to allocate and manage their assets. Navigating these complex choices may be particularly difficult for minority elderly, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Indeed, health indicators have demonstrated little improvement in health disparities between different racial and ethnic populations over the past decade, according to analyses in Healthy People 2010. Evidence also suggests that minority households tend to be excluded from or participate only on the margins of the financial mainstream. To this end we propose to establish a RCMAR at USC that will develop an infrastructure to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1. Provide leadership, organizational, communication and evaluation systems to achieve the overarching goal of supporting high-quality and enduring research careers in the health and economic challenges of minority elderly; 2. Support pilot study solicitation and selection process to ensure the selection of scientifically rigorous and fundable pilot projects and enhancement of the diversity of researchers; 3. Support pilot-funded investigators through achievement of pilot studies goals and award of an independent grant by multidisciplinary mentoring and training in the methods and tools of economics, computer science, medicine, and social work; 4. Analyze large longitudinal survey data sets and medical claims data on the health, medical care and expenditures, economic status, and financial decisions of diverse elderly populations in order to generate interventions that will address health and economic disparities; 5. Track and evaluate the successes of pilot investigators and data analysis and improve the infrastructure support in accordance with evaluation findings. This proposed RCMAR is a collaboration between USC and RAND that utilizes the resources of USC's Roybal Center on Health Policy Simulation, Roybal Institute on Aging, Alzheimer Disease Research Center, and RAND's Roybal Center for Financial Decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the health and economics issues associated with the aging process are of such magnitude and complexity that they cannot be approached from the vantage point of any single discipline alone.

"Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) The Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) has three research themes: 1) understanding multilevel determinants of disparities, 2) evaluating through secondary data analysis the effects of policies that reduce public services among minority older adults, and 3) translating evidence-based interventions to prevent/manage chronic conditions and mitigate the effects of stressful environments in minority communities. The Administrative Core will coordinate all CADC functions, select pilot studies for funding, host Advisory Board meetings, allocate effort to update the web site, and sustain collaborations with UCSF colleagues. The Investigator Development Core will fund 3-5 scholars every year through the process of Request for Proposals and review. CADC faculty will formally mentor funded scholars to completion of their research, publication of a paper, submission of a faculty development or independent research grant to NIA/NIH, and becoming established in their academic units. The multidisciplinary nature of CADC faculty provide scholars with a variety of content mentors in the clinical, epidemiological, behavioral, and social sciences, including a neuroscientist and health economist. We will promote use of secondary datasets to identify multi-level determinants of disparities and evaluate the impact of policy changes using interrupted time-series methods. We will also encourage scholars to develop pilot interventions to reduce health disparities. The Community Liaison Core will support recruitment of research participants for funded projects, advance the science of recruitment and disseminate research findings to the target communities. The Analysis Core will work closely with scholars to provide technical assistance in specialized methods in minority aging, develop measurement projects to identify determinants of disparities, and provide guidance to pilot test community-based interventions.

"A Longitudinal Study of Endocrine Disruptor Mixtures and Reproductive Aging Project Summary/Abstract Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is widespread and these compounds can persist in the environment and the human body over decades. The population is aging, and women, in particular, can experience significant morbidity and diminished quality of life with aging. Recent epidemiologic data suggest that the timing of reproductive aging (the gradual decline in ovarian function with age) and the pattern of hormonal change during the menopausal transition influence women’s risk of chronic disease and their long- term health with aging. While numerous studies have examined adverse reproductive health effects and exposure to EDCs, little is known about how EDCs affect the timing or process of reproductive aging. Further, most existing epidemiologic studies on this topic have been cross-sectional with studies of age-at-menopause based on recall, limiting causal inference. In addition, combined exposure to various EDCs and pollutant- pollutant interactions (mixtures), as well as low-dose and non-monotonic dose-responses have been rarely if at all addressed. The proposed new epidemiologic study in a multi-ethnic cohort of women seeks to better understand how EDCs exposure affects the timing and characteristics of reproductive aging. We propose 1) to assess associations between EDC exposure (polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated pesticides, brominated flame retardants, and perfluorinated compounds) and timing of reproductive aging, including age at menopause and duration of the menopausal transition; 2) to assess the association between EDC exposure and hormonal characteristics during the menopausal transition, including levels and patterns of change in estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, testosterone, sex-hormone binding globulin, and anti-Müllerian hormone; and 3) to examine the simultaneous effects of multiple EDCs and their interactions (mixture effects) on these reproductive aging outcomes using regression methods for high-dimensional covariates (multi-pollutant approaches). We will also explore effect modification by race/ethnicity and temporal variations in EDCs. We will capitalize on extensive phenotypic data and biospecimens collected for more than 15 years in an ongoing, large longitudinal cohort of women, the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (n=1,800 with a total of ~14,000 observations). This project addresses strategic priorities of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, including disease pathogenesis by combined environmental exposures, as well as environmental health disparities. We will address these issues using innovative analytic approaches likely to yield new insights on the study of pollution mixtures and human health. The knowledge gained from this research may guide disease prevention initiatives; enhance women’s health and wellbeing as they age; and reduce environmental health disparities. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because comprehensive evaluation of the impact of multiple EDCs on reproductive aging will further our understanding of how complex exposures to EDCs may accelerate, delay or disrupt reproductive aging during this critical life stage. Such information would help inform the critical timing of interventions to effectively prevent or reduce the risk of chronic diseases and premature mortality. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIEHS’s mission that discovers how EDC exposures affect women’s health with aging in order to promote healthy aging.",A Longitudinal Study of Endocrine Disruptor Mixtures and Reproductive Aging,9321364,R01ES026964,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Body Composition ', ' Body Size ', ' Weight Change ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fertility ', ' Fire Retardants ', ' Flame Retardants ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Japanese ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Menopause ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Premature Menopause ', ' early menopause ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research: This project will create five different one-day conferences on current NIA initiatives that are relevant to minority aging research. The goal of the proposed conference series is to increase the quality, quantity, and relevance to communities of color of NIA-fundable research by providing both junior and senior researchers with new knowledge and greater interest in these emerging issues as they apply to minority elderly. This is significant because the number and proportion of the U.S. older population from racial and ethnic minority communities is growing rapidly: minorities will increase from 20% to over 40% of the older population between 2010 and 2050. Protecting and improving the health of these elderly requires a highly skilled research workforce with interests and capabilities in this area to produce new and useful knowledge. Yet the number and success of minority researchers funded by NIH is insufficient. The NIA's Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) program works to mentor and train junior faculty who conduct research on minority aging to strengthen the next generation of NIA-funded ethnic and racial minority researchers. The conferences will focus on: Cognitive health disparities research and national policy, Use of well-being measures in minority aging research and policy analyses, Stigma in minority aging research, Mutability and reversibility of risk factors across diverse populations, and Concepts and measures of stress and resilience for minority aging research. Each will feature leading scholars on the topic, top scholars on minority aging, and representatives from multiple NIA-funded centers and networks. The programs will disseminate the state of the art on the topic, inform researchers on how existing research needs to be modified or expanded to be more valid and relevant for minority elders, and provide tools that can be used by researchers to further develop the fields in research with minority elders. The conferences will be held as preconferences to the Gerontological Society of America (GSA) annual scientific meetings. There will be at least 50 participants at each conference and the majority will be minorities and/or women. The planning committee will be compromised of the confirmed keynote speakers who are leaders in the field, researchers from RCMAR sites with expertise in the topic, and members of other NIA-funded networks. The executive committee will be the RCMAR directors group. The project is innovative in the topics covered, the research networks involved, and the synergy with GSA. Program evaluation includes a process evaluation, a retrospective pre/post knowledge and confidence survey, and four-month follow-up survey on conference impacts. The lead investigators are national leaders in minority aging and gerontological education who have successfully led 11 previous GSA preconferences that reached over 600 researchers. This proposal is a renewal of the previous successful series with new topics but similar objectives of improving the knowledge and interest in emerging issues supported by NIA among RCMAR Scholars and faculty as well as among others with research agendas in minority aging and related issues; and raising awareness of how minority aging issues intersect these priority topics to promote research in the cutting edge issues. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older adults from racial and ethnic minorities communities often experience health risks and respond to health interventions differently than non-Hispanic whites. Understanding how to maximize the health of all older adults requires researchers who are knowledgeable about the theories, methods, and existing science relevant to minority elders. This conference series will educate researchers about the state of the art in emerging areas of NIA-funded research critical to population health and provide them with skills and motivation to expand that research in minority communities, increasing its relevance to the groups that will soon comprise 40% of the older adult population.",Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research,9247103,R13AG023033,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Exercise ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Peer Review ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' journal article ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stream ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' Distance Learning ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Committee Members ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' stress resilience ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' public health relevance ', ' biodemography ', ' population health ', ' Learning Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Education Module ', ' faculty research ', ' racial minority ', ' online resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' on-line resource ', ' internet resource ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R13,2017,50000,0.08785054622227782
"Mentoring in Patient Oriented Research on Food Insecurity, HIV and Aging Project Summary  Dr. Weiser is an internist trained in HIV epidemiology whose research program focuses on the intersection between food insecurity (FI) and health outcomes in HIV, and on interventions to reduce FI as a mechanism to improve HIV care delivery. She is a sought-after mentor and won the UCSF Academic Senate Distinction in Mentoring Award. Protected time for mentoring and for an innovative new line of research is instrumental for her to achieve her long-term career goals of becoming an international leader in patient-oriented research (POR) related to FI and HIV health, and of developing a multidisciplinary mentoring program and eventual training hub in this area. This K24 application proposes a comprehensive plan for career development, mentoring, and research, which together work towards the goal of reducing HIV health disparities, including an expansion of her research into a new direction by examining how FI affects aging outcomes in HIV.

She will recruit mentees from new disciplines such as geriatrics, neurology and psychology, and more mentees from underrepresented backgrounds as is critical for health disparities research. This mentoring program will help her train the next generation of researchers in FI and HIV.  To stimulate innovative POR while providing opportunities for increased, more effective mentoring, she proposes to leverage the platform of the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and expand her research into three new domains: 1) determining the impact of FI on aging outcomes including frailty and cognitive impairment; 2) understanding the mechanisms though which FI may mediate these outcomes using a novel conceptual model; and 3) investigating upstream determinants of FI using census tract data. This study is innovative in being: 1) one of the first to determine longitudinal impacts of FI on frailty and cognitive impairment and the first among HIV-infected women; 2) one of the first to assess potential mechanisms for how FI may contribute to frailty and cognitive impairment; and 3) one of the first to evaluate neighborhood-level predictors of FI using a rigorous multi-level modeling approach, and in a large sample of HIV-infected and uninfected women. To accomplish her aims and answer high impact questions at minimal cost, she will leverage data already collected in WIHS, and add measurements of FI and dietary quality for three years. She will also lead a qualitative study to understand the neighborhood- and policy-level contexts of FI and how they shape the lived experiences of health. The proposed research will help Dr. Weiser build a strong interdisciplinary network of early career investigators, provide an opportunity to address her training goals, accelerate progress towards her long- term career goals, and provide preliminary data and training opportunities for her mentees. Public Health Relevance  Food insecurity is common among poor women and HIV-infected persons, and has been associated with worse HIV and chronic disease outcomes, especially among aging populations. The proposed 5-year study aims to answer key unresolved questions, namely “What is the magnitude of the impact of food insecurity on aging outcomes in HIV?”, “Which mechanisms drive this impact?” and “What are the upstream drivers of food insecurity in an aging population?”. This research will be critical to: 1) help inform which HIV-infected persons to prioritize for new interventions; 2) select among the various programmatic options for improving food insecurity among HIV-infected women; 3) provide the best and most feasible causal evidence linking FI and aging outcomes which may garner funding to alleviate FI in this population; and 4) inform the integration of systems responding to these interlinked problems, given that funding and programs for FI, aging and HIV are largely separate. 1","Mentoring in Patient Oriented Research on Food Insecurity, HIV and Aging",9410895,K24AI134326,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Censuses ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' Color ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exercise ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Improving the Health of Low-SES Americans Approaching Retirement Under the Affordable Care Act PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Renuka Tipirneni, MD, MSc is a general internist and junior health services researcher focused on improving the health care system for prematurely aging low socioeconomic status (SES) adults approaching retirement age. Dr. Tipirneni's long-term career objective is to become an independent mixed methods investigator integrating large-scale clinical and economic data with in-depth qualitative data to inform the design and evaluation of policies and programs to improve the health of low-SES aging adults. Research Context: Low-SES Americans approaching retirement face a crisis of poor health and markedly increasing mortality. Between 2001 and 2014, disparities in life expectancy between low- and high-SES adults near retirement have widened and this may have accounted for 500,000 excess deaths. Yet the drivers of this crisis are poorly understood. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) should improve access to care through insurance expansions and care delivery innovations and help this group manage chronic conditions and improve their health. However, it is not clear how low-SES aging adults are specifically benefitting from ACA policies, which groups should be principally targeted for new care delivery programs encouraged under the ACA, and what factors are associated with successful health improvement and decreased costs for at-risk aging Americans. Specific Aims: 1) Determine changes in coverage, access, utilization, health and financial stress for low-SES 55-64-year-olds before and after the ACA Medicaid expansion; 2) Classify sub-groups of low-SES 55-64-year- olds at highest risk of poor health and characterize heterogeneity of changes in access, utilization, health and costs in identified high-risk sub-groups; 3) Identify facilitators of and barriers to improvements in health outcomes and health care utilization among high-risk low-SES aging adults in an ACA care delivery program. Research Plan: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Tipirneni will perform quasi-experimental analyses with the Health and Retirement Study to assess health and health care changes before and after the ACA. She will then identify sub-groups of low-SES near retirement adults at high risk of poor health trajectories. Lastly, she will conduct qualitiatve interviews with low-SES near retirement adults in an ACA care delivery program to identify facilitators of and barriers to health improvement and decreased high-cost utilization. Career Development Plan: Dr. Tipirneni will develop expertise in 1) analysis of large-scale longitudinal survey and administrative data; 2) application of quasi-experimental approaches to evaluate programs; 3) mixed methods research; and 4) programmatic research focused on aging adults. Dr. Tipirneni's career development goals will be supported by close mentorship from an interdisciplinary team; advanced didactic coursework; participation in research and career development meetings/seminars; and ongoing guidance in her research. Environment: The University of Michigan offers the ideal environment for her to pursue this training, with the outstanding guidance of well-established mentors and interdisciplinary institutes dedicated to her success. PROJECT NARRATIVE Low-income Americans approaching retirement age have been increasingly dying at alarming rates compared with higher-income Americans, yet the drivers of this crisis are poorly understood. The Affordable Care Act's new insurance options and health care delivery programs may offer strategies to help at-risk aging Americans, but it is not clear who should be targeted for such policies and programs and which elements are most helpful. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify potentially modifiable risk factors for poor health among these at-risk aging Americans in order to help design and evaluate policies and programs to improve the health of low-SES aging adults.",Improving the Health of Low-SES Americans Approaching Retirement Under the Affordable Care Act,9370582,K08AG056591,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Award ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Premature Aging ', ' Premature aging syndrome ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Internist ', ' Respondent ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Physical Function ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' cohort ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' experimental analysis ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' Medicare claim ', ' profiles in patients ', ' patient profile ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2017,166763,0.11280738603738408
"Biodemography of Aging in Wild Chimpanzees DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While it is clear that lifespan was extended during human evolution, there is remarkably little data available to assess the specific ways by which this remarkable change in life history came about. This missing information could importantly inform the understanding of how modern lifestyles, in interaction with our evolved biology, produce the health outcomes observed in developed countries. A major limitation at present is a dearth of data on the aging process in humans' closest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee. The current study would be the first to gather comprehensive data on aging in wild chimpanzees, whose health has not been manipulated by humans during captive management or biomedical experimentation. Like humans during most of their evolutionary history, wild chimpanzees experience frequent nutritional stress and high rates of infectious disease and these processes - little studied in modern aging research - are expected to have shaped species-normative life history strategies. The project entails non-invasive collection of urine and feces from approximately 245 wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) for a broad range of health biomarkers, in additional to observational research for observed morbidity, locomotor proficiency, and social behavior. New data collection will complement and extend existing long-term demographic data, as well as individual histories of social interaction and reproductive effort. The wild data will be supplemented by additional blood-based biomarkers obtained during routine veterinary immobilizations of approximately 240 semi-free ranging chimpanzees in African sanctuaries. The project integrates investigators from major studies of health and aging in human foraging populations, and the central aim (1) of the project is to perform structured comparisons of health and aging between humans and chimpanzees. To further this goal, the additional project aims focus on key variables that are expected to shape senescence, and which are associated with prominent behavioral differences between species: (2) sex differences and the allocation of reproductive effort across the life history, (3) stability of accss to energy, and (4) social status and support. Information gathered in pursuit of these aims has specific relevance to prominent focuses of human aging research: the gender morbidity-mortality paradox, caloric restriction, and the influences of chronic stress and social subordination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern human aging and mortality patterns result from a combination of our modern lifestyle and our evolved patterns of senescence and repair. While there is excellent information on the former, very little is understood about the processes affecting the evolution of the unusual human lifespan. The current study quantifies aging patterns in wild chimpanzees and incorporates specific comparisons with traditional human populations in order to elucidate key mechanisms of evolutionary change from our ape ancestors.",Biodemography of Aging in Wild Chimpanzees,9340050,R01AG049395,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Animals ', ' Biology ', ' Bolivia ', ' Chimpanzee troglodytes ', ' Pan troglodytes ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Data Collection ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immobilization ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Infection ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pongidae ', ' great ape ', ' Apes ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Tanzania ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Pan Species ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Chimp ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' species difference ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Funding ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Shapes ', ' fighting ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' interest ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' life history ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' mate ', ' Social status ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' social ', ' reproductive ', ' Sampling ', ' Habitats ', ' Caloric Restriction ', ' calorie restriction ', ' calorie restricted ', ' calorically restricted ', ' caloric restricted ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' urinary ', ' Behavioral ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' comparative ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biodemography ', ' reproductive senescence ', ' spermatozoal senescence ', ' spermatozoa senescence ', ' sperm senescence ', ' sperm cell senescence ', ' reproductive cell senescence ', ' reproductive aging ', ' ovulatory senescence ', ' ovarian senescence ', ' study population ', ' Cardiac health ', ' Heart health ', ' blood-based biomarker ', ' blood-based marker ', ' immune health ', ' immune system health ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,R01,2017,599461,0.14758530275866813
"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: renewal 2014 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for competitive funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for the period 2014 - 2020. ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), and recruited 12,100 men and women aged 50 and above who were representative of the older population of England. ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with half of the funding coming from a consortium of UK Government Departments. This renewal request is to fund three waves of data collection - waves 7 (2014/15), 8 (2016/17), and 9 (2018/19) - and associated analyses. The central objective is to provide the high quality data necessary for an exploration of the dynamic relationships between health and functioning, economic position, social participation, wellbeing, cognitive function and health as people plan for, move into and progress beyond retirement. ELSA is a multidisciplinary study, involving the collection of economic, epidemiological, health, social, psychological, physiological and genetic data. The phase of data collection planned in this application will greatly increase the potential for longitudinal analyses so as to examine causal process.  The research agenda of this application is focused on the following broad issues that are important scientifically while also being relevant to policy: comparisons of trajectories of health and wellbeing in England, the USA, and other countries; the determinants of economic wellbeing in older age; the nature and timing of retirement and post-retirement labor market activity; the interaction between psychosocial, genetic, and biological determinants of health and mortality; cognitive functioning and its impact on decision making among older people; disability and the compression of morbidity; the implications of mild cognitive impairment for social, economic and subjective wellbeing; economic, social and health inequalities in an ageing population; social participation and social productivity at older ages; intergenerational relationships and generativity; and health care utilization and transitions to social care.  The specific objectives of the new proposal are to: 1. Design the survey instruments for further waves data collection, building on the existing data from these respondents and maximizing comparability with HRS and other studies 2. Develop and incorporate new assessments of intergenerational transfers, generativity, mild cognitive impairment, hearing, patient preferences and health service use. 3.

"Advancing aging research through development of minority gerontologists DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of establishing the Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR) program at Howard University (HUADAR) is to identify a group of bright minority students from MSTEM disciplines early during their undergraduate years and then through extensive mentoring and training prepare them to successfully compete for graduate studies and other professional careers. By making them familiar with aging research early in their career, this cadre of minority researchers could be made squarely interested about building a career on geriatrics and gerontology. The Rationales for developing an HUADAR program is quite justifiable, for more than a century Howard University is engaged in training underrepresented minority students. About 97% of Howard's mentees are African Americans and National Science Foundation's (NSF) recent ranking put Howard University as the top producer of bachelor's degree recipients who subsequently earned science and engineering doctoral degrees nationally from top-tier research universities. Moreover, with an aggressive recruitment effort, Howard University successfully recruited several faculty members in MSTEM areas who are maintaining an active research programs on various aspects of aging and age related disorders. Therefore, Howard University has the ideal environment to identify a cadre of talented minority scientists early during their undergraduate years and it has the required resources to provide them with a foundation of knowledge and research skills through mentoring so that these students will excel in the interdisciplinary field of gerontology. Trainee compositio for HUADAR program will include 100% underrepresented minorities. Approximately 7,000 undergraduate students enroll at Howard in 29 undergraduate departments and programs, approximately 97% of enrollees are African American and 67% are women. Furthermore, 20% (or 1,400) major in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering and Allied Health with greater than 80% declaring medicine as their career goal. We plan to recruit five students from MSTEM disciplines each year by selecting them early at the end of their freshman year using a recruitment strategy which includes: a) identification of strong performing students in the introductory courses, b) students enrolled in the Honors Program, c) recommendations by faculty members, and d) students responding to advertisements, announcements, and oral presentations. Proposed training is a comprehensive research education plan designed for HUADAR trainees which consists of following components: (1) develop two new courses on aging, (2) exposure to aging research in various laboratories at Howard during sophomore and junior years, (3) attending research seminars by prominent gerontologists, (4) a summer research apprenticeship opportunity outside Howard University in leading research institutes on aging like NIA Baltimore, UT Health Sciences Center, Johns Hopkins, Georgetown University Medical Centers, University of Maryland and University of Washington, (5) writing a honors thesis/senior thesis during senior year, (6) provide one on one mentoring to build a successful career path. Thus, from their sophomore year up to the senior year we have a carefully laid out plans to educate the HUADAR trainees on different aspects of aging research including the social aspects of aging. All students and personnel will be required to participate in instruction on the Responsible Conduct of Research. Evaluation plan for HUADAR will consist of course evaluations, student performances, faculty efficacy surveys, summer research experience surveys, successful completion of an honors thesis/senior thesis. The long-term goal of HUADAR program is to prepare minority students as future researchers through scientific training and educational experiences and we will encourage them to seek aging research as a career goal. Thus we will embrace the goal of NIA ADAR initiative to ""fill a gap in the pipeline transitioning from undergraduate to graduate education in aging as it relates to medicine, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to fulfill the objectives of the NIA Health Disparities Strategic Plan"". PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By 2030 we will be living in an America with 1 in 5 American 65 years or older. The ethnic minority portion of our population is growing at an amazing pace from 4.3 million persons in 1990 to 22.5 million expected by the year 2050. This nation needs to be prepared to deal with ethnically diverse minority elderlies who will account for more than 15% of older persons by 2020 and more than 21% of older persons by 2050. Since health disparity among the ethnically diverse minority population is real and we have to deal with it immediately. Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR) is an attempt to identify a cadre of minority scientists early during their undergraduate years, provide them with a foundation of knowledge and research skills through mentoring so these students will excel in the interdisciplinary field o gerontology. With this conviction, this proposal lay out a detail research education plan to establish an ADAR program at Howard University called HUADAR. In the long term HUADAR trainees will create culturally sensitive health measures to assess the health status of minority elders with greater precision.",Advancing aging research through development

"An Experimental Investigation into the Impact of Socioeconomic Context on Biological Markers of Aging, Health and Mortality Poverty disproportionately impacts minority and rural populations and is very strongly correlated with poor health over the life cycle, and has been hypothesized to lead to a shorter, less healthy aging process. Poverty is associated with a greater burden of disease than smoking and obesity combined and accounts for the bulk of health disparities by race. It is widely believed that an anti-poverty policy—such as Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)—could improve healthy aging among working-age low-income adults over the life cycle. It does so by increasing material hardship and psychological stress—two risk factors that are strongly correlated with biological markers of premature aging (e.g., shorter telomeres, higher cholesterol levels, and higher blood pressure.) However, the literature linking poverty to health is largely built on correlational data, which is subject to confounding and reverse causation. The experienced research firm MDRC has secured private and public funding for a groundbreaking multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) that examines the causal impacts of quadrupling EITC for working adults without dependent children in Atlanta, GA and New York City, NY called Paycheck Plus (PP). Randomization exposes the treatment group to up to $2000 in PP compared to up to $496 in the control group. However, MDRC is not studying the impacts of PP on health. We propose leveraging MDRC’s existing infrastructure and our long history of collaboration with MDRC to add clinical, survey, and administrative measures to explore whether PP improves the health and survival of adult recipients without dependent children. Timed with launch of the study in Atlanta, we propose in-person health screenings with collection of important biomarkers of chronic disease, such as blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), blood glucose, cholesterol, and C-reactive protein (measures that are conceptually linked to poverty). For both the NYC and Atlanta Cohorts, we propose adding survey data that measures health-related quality of life and depression. Since not everybody randomized to the treatment group will file taxes (a requisite for the treated group to receive PP or the control group to receive traditional EITC), we will analyze our health outcomes using an Intent to Treat (ITT) versus Treatment on the Treated (ToT) analysis. This will produce Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) estimates of the unbiased impact of increased PP on health. In addition, we will collect long-term follow up data on mortality for both treatment sites. We will do so by linking individual identifiers administrative mortality data from the National Death Index. Finally, we will model the health and longevity gains associated with PP relative to traditional EITC. This project is innovative for exploiting a planned and fully funded social science experiment to explore outcome measures that were not originally considered by the policymakers. This project is also innovative for being a RTC of an anti-poverty program that uses administrative and clinical health data at a very low cost. We anticipate that PP will be an efficient approach to promoting healthy aging by lifting adults without dependent children out of poverty. Narrative The Columbia University team has partnered with the research firm MDRC to conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) that examines the health and survival outcomes associated with an extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for lower-income Americans without dependent children. Associational evidence suggests that EITC may have a significant impact on the health and survival over the life cycle of those who receive the credit, leading to healthy aging. However, experimental data is needed to prove this linkage.","An Experimental Investigation into the Impact of Socioeconomic Context on Biological Markers of Aging, Health and

"Linking 1940 U.S. Census Data to Five Modern Surveys of Health and Aging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will link records from the 1940 U.S. Census to records for respondents to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS); the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID); the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS); the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP); and the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). These ongoing longitudinal studies are the cornerstones of America's data infrastructure for interdisciplinary research on aging and the life course; physical and mental health, disability, and well-being; later-life work, economic well-being, and retirement; and end-of-life issues. A crucial limitation of these studies is that they contain little information about social, economic, family, neighborhood, and environmental circumstances in childhood and young adulthood. The sparse early-life information that is now available is usually collected retrospectively in later adulthood; the quality of these few retrospective reports is largely unknown. This serious limitation of these data hinders researchers' ability to study the long-term impacts of childhood and young adult circumstances and to understand how later-life outcomes are the result of cumulative life-course processes. Linking these studies to the 1940 U.S. Census will produce data infrastructure that vastly expands their analytic utility for a variety of substantive problem. This project involves (1) preparing and formatting data files containing respondents' identifying information; (2) deploying sophisticated machine linking algorithms to link the project records to the 1940 U.S. Census; (3) hand linking records that cannot be machine linked and hand-verifying a portion of those that can; (6) creating individual-, family-, and contextual/spatial-leel variables that are consistent with IPUMS and comparable across projects; (7) documenting the new measures and making them available as part of projects' restricted access dissemination systems in a manner consistent with respondents' privacy rights; (8) publicizing the resulting measures and conducting user outreach to maximize the utility and visibility of the new data resource; and (9) conducting methodological analyses to assess the validity of retrospective reports of childhood social and economic circumstances. The project will be led by a team from the Minnesota Population Center in collaboration with each projects' leadership team. The researchers have considerable expertise in the construction and analysis of longitudinal studies of health and aging and in historical record linkage using machine and hand linking techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will substantially improve basic infrastructure for demographic, social scientific, and public health research on aging, retirement, health, mortality, economic circumstances, and well-being in later adulthood; it will transform our ability to understand the long-term impact of social, economic, genetic, demographic, neighborhood, contextual, and environmental circumstances and exposures in early life on any of the later-life outcomes observed in America's most important studies of health, aging, and retirement. The proposed work is directly relevant to the central mission of the NIH as the steward of medical and behavioral research for the nation: the resulting data will advance fundamental knowledge about population health and population dynamics and will spawn a new generation of research across disciplines.",Linking 1940 U.S. Census Data to Five Modern Surveys of Health and Aging,9397505,R01AG050300,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Coal ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Hand ', ' Household Heads ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Industry ', ' Labor Forces ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Marital Status ', ' Marriage ', ' Marriage Ages ', ' age at marriage ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methodology ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mission ', ' Modernization ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Birth Place ', ' Play ', ' Population Density ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Power Plants ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Retirement ', ' Rights ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' School Enrollments ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tongue ', ' Veterans ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Privacy ', ' Family member ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Discipline ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Data Files ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Inequality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' grandparent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' health record ', ' Agreement ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Institution ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' data format ', ' public health research ', ' population health ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' data resource ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,539929,0.10694019790079831
"Immunologic Health in Aging PLWH PROJECT SUMMARY In the era of combination antiretroviral therapy, routine care of persons living with HIV infection (PLWH) requires extra attention to coinfections and comorbidities, as PLWH with impaired immunologic competency (IIC) are prone to non-AIDS morbidity and mortality. We propose that IIC is also the basis for accelerated/ premature aging (A/PA) in PLWH and that herpes zoster (shingles) can serve as a readily diagnosed sentinel disease for studying molecular and immunologic correlates of A/PA. To prove these concepts, we have already gathered compelling data from a Southeast US cohort of PLWH (N = 4,225) to demonstrate that relatively young PLWH (30-55 years old) are already at high risk of developing herpes zoster, but recurrent herpes zoster is relatively rare. New research can now focus on the disparity between biological age and chronological age in PLWH and on the dynamics of immune protection against recurrent herpes zoster. Specifically, aim 1 will identify DNA methylation (epigenetic) age and molecular signatures of memory T-cells shortly before the onset of herpes zoster, using high-throughput techniques to define genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles. Aim 2 will compare virus-specific T-cell activation, proliferation and immune function after co-culture with pools of immunogens derived from the varicella-zoster virus, using samples from two visits after the first occurrence of herpes zoster. These studies will target two primary ethnic groups (African Americans and European Americans) with disparate HIV/AIDS burdens and will properly account for potential confounders (e.g., coinfections and comorbidities) as observed in a clinical setting. For further translation, analyses of DNA methylation age (aim 1) should help with the design and implementation of interventional strategies for alleviating or reversing IIC in diverse PLWH populations, including the application of a newly available recombinant vaccine (Shingrix) against herpes zoster. PROJECT NARRATIVE HIV infection severely impairs immunological competence and accelerates aging. In order to better understand the compounding health issues in persons living with HIV infection, this 2-year project aims to identify correlates of biological age and immunologic health, using herpes zoster as a sentinel disease outcome.",Immunologic Health in Aging PLWH,9622517,R21AI134282,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Attention ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chronology ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Esters ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Herpes zoster disease ', ' herpes zona ', ' Zoster ', ' Zona ', ' Shingles ', ' Herpes Zoster ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HLA-DR Antigens ', ' HLA-MT Antigens ', ' HLA-MT ', ' HLA-DR ', ' HLA-D-Related Antigens ', ' HLA-BR Antigens ', ' HLA-BR ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunocompetence ', ' Immunological Competence ', ' Immunologic Competence ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' Immunological System Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immunodeficiency and Immunosuppression Disorders ', ' Immune System and Related Disorders ', ' Immune System Dysfunction ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Kinetics ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methylation ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Immunologic Monitoring ', ' Immunosurveillance ', ' Immunological Monitoring ', ' Immune Monitoring ', ' Morbidity -

"An Analysis of Psychosocial Risk and Protective Factors: Accelerated Cognitive Aging and Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Among Retired NFL & Former NCAA Football Players Project Summary/Abstract: Robert W. Turner II is a Research Associate in the Center on Biobehavioral Health Disparities Research at Duke University. He has training in medical sociology, ethnographic methods, and health disparities research as well as a strong commitment to improving the mental health of adult males. His previous and current work has exposed him to theoretical perspectives and empirical approaches pertinent to health disparity and aging research among men. The current proposal is for a five year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that address gaps in his knowledge of biobehavioral factors underlying mild traumatic brain injury mTBI and accelerated cognitive aging. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Tim Strauman, Keith Whitfield, and Toni Antonucci) he has developed a comprehensive training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on the interrelationships between multiple measures of psychosocial and neurocognitive factors associated with accelerated cognitive aging, and serve as bridge for him to establish an independent investigator career in conducting biobehavioral health disparities research in aging adult male populations. To accomplish this goal, he proposes four career development activities and three research aims that combines instruction with established scholars in survey research techniques; formal coursework; participation in ongoing seminars at Duke University; one-to-one directed readings with mentors; and finally, conduction of a “proof of concept study” from start to finish. Preliminary data will be collected with using a mixed-method design that consists of a survey, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by creating a more robust overall portrait of psychosocial protective and risk factors that may impact the long-term consequences of mTBI among men than previously possible. The approach used in this project will address; a) male vulnerabilities in predicting the impact of psychosocial factors on accelerated cognitive aging and b) how understandings of masculinity develop across and within groups in relationship to pain, injury, and brain health. This project will continue to build on insights he has gained through his examination of data from the Study of Retired NFL Players. By completing these aims, he will test important hypotheses and make a substantial contribution to the evidence base by describing the process of cognitive accelerated aging resulting from mTBI. This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore innovative approaches to address functional, cognitive, and psychosocial vulnerabilities in concussed men, and may ultimately reduce the risk of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Alzheimer's disease resulting from concussions. It will also inform an R-series grant proposal to study accelerated cognitive aging and brain imaging that Dr. Turner plans to submit in year 4 of the project. Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is a common, costly, and potentially preventable condition in the United States. Despite heightened awareness as a result of national public health campaigns and increased visibility in the media, many individuals continue to be at risk of life- long and sometime debilitating effects of brain injury. The goal of this project is to explore innovative approaches to address functional, cognitive, and psychosocial vulnerabilities in concussed men, which may ultimately reduce the risk of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Alzheimer's disease resulting from concussions.",An Analysis of Psychosocial Risk and Protective Factors: Accelerated Cognitive Aging and Mild Traumatic Brain

"The Center for Health Improvement of Minority Elderly Project Summary Overall Component UCLA Center for Health Improvement for Minority Elders (CHIME) proposes continuation of a research and mentoring program initially funded in 2002, that will contribute to the reduction in health disparities for minority elders by training minority faculty who will advance their careers by conducting minority aging research. CHIME has 5 specific aims: 1) to develop the research infrastructure needed to improve the health of minority elders through the development, implementation, and evaluation of community and health sytem interventions designed to mitigate health disparities which incorporates two of NIA's areas of scientific focus: i) research aimed at understanding and modifying organizational or individual behaviors associated with positive and negative health outcomes in later life and ii) research on factors that affect population aging, as well as the consequences of population aging; 2) to conduct rigorous analyses of existing data sets to identify community, health system, and person level correlates of health disparities to inform the design of interventions or health policies to mitigate health disparities; 3) to contribute to the development, evaluation, and dissemination of measures that can be used to track health outcomes or measure critical social, behavioral, and economic predictors of the health and the health-care of minority elders; 4) to build on CHIME’s 15 year track record of successful academic advancement of minority faculty through mentorship and support of their conduct of independent research on the health of minority elders; 5) to broaden both existing and new partnerships with communities to expand the pool of potential minority research participants and the beneficiaries of the findings from both the research conducted under the auspices of CHIME and other funded research. CHIME will address these aims through activities that are organized in an Administration Core (AC), a Research Education Component (REC), an Analysis Core (AnC), and a Community Liaison and Recruitment Core (CLRC). The AC and REC in collaboration with the External Advisory Group will select pilot studies and organize the mentorship of RCMAR Scientists, CLRC will assist with recruitment and AnC will provide highly innovative methodological training for RCMAR Scientists. Project Narrative for the Overall Component This renewal application, if successful, will allow UCLA CHIME to continue contributing substantially to mitigating health disparities for minority elders by developing minority investigators and arming them with the needed research skills to develop, implement, and evaluate community and health system partnered interventions in communities with the greatest health needs.",The Center for Health Improvement of Minority Elderly,9532381,P30AG021684,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' minority health ', ' community intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' arm ', ' teacher development ', ' instructor training ', ' faculty professional development ', ' faculty development ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' behavioral economics ', ' education research ', ' minority investigator ', ' recruit ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P30,2018,656507,0.06995350418975015
"Education, socioeconomic status and Aging: transitions from multimorbidity to functional limitations and mortality Project Summary Recent data suggest ongoing increases in life expectancy are accompanied by widening socioeconomic differences in life expectancy and disability. The overarching aim of this application is to understand the role of socioeconomic factors in shaping ageing outcomes, the innovation lies in the use of multi-state models (MSM) to study multiple health events that occur over the course of aging. Much of the research on aging uses time-to-event or survival analysis, where only one health outcome (chronic disease, multimorbidity, disability, or death) can be examined at a time and the inter-relationships among these outcomes are not considered. We propose to use MSM to examine the role of socioeconomic factors in transitions from a healthy state to chronic disease, to subsequent multimorbidity, to disability and death in a single analytic framework using 30-years follow-up in the Whitehall study. We identify multimorbidity due to aging of populations and poor understanding of their impact on functional impairment, disability and death critical to understanding social disparities in health at older ages. The cross-sectional nature of much of the research on multimorbidity and disability does not allow identification of prevention targets that could be used to close the gap in health status of older adults. Our approach focuses on transitions or changes in health states with ageing and examines the role of socioeconomic factors and how psychosocial, behavioral, and biological factors explain social disparities in these transitions. Our proposal is based on the Whitehall study which has pioneered research on health inequalities. We propose to examine socioeconomic disparities and underlying mechanisms in chronic diseases, transitions to multimorbidity and mortality (AIM 1), examine whether socioeconomic factors buffer the association of multimorbidity with disability, and that of disability with mortality and identify underlying mechanisms (AIM 2), and assess the role of SES in shaping the association of functional impairment (subjective and objective assessments) with mortality, and its role in terminal decline, i.e. accelerated decline in function prior to death (AIM 3). Increased life expectancy and reduced disability rates in the high socioeconomic groups suggest that it is possible to improve aging outcomes in the entire population to ensure that most older adults remain healthy, active, and independent for as long as possible. In order to do this, better understanding is needed of the pathways through which high SES promotes health and functioning at older ages; evidence that this proposal aims to generate. Project Narrative Socioeconomic disparities in health are one of the most consistent findings of epidemiologic research; ongoing increases in life expectancy are accompanied by widening socioeconomic differences in longevity and disability even in high income countries. We propose to use longitudinal data on the same set of persons followed prospectively over 30 years in the Whitehall study to identify how socioeconomic circumstances affect stages of aging and underlying mechanisms. We will examine the role of socioeconomic factors in onset of chronic disease, progression to multimorbidity, to disability, and death using multi-state models which allow analysis of all these transitions. The overarching objective is to identify stages in aging over the lifecourse and underlying risk factors which are responsible for increasing social disparities in health at older ages.","Education, socioeconomic status and Aging: transitions from multimorbidity to functional limitations and mortality",9522896,R01AG056477,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Buffers ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' cognitive function ', ' Event ', ' Country ', ' Physical Function ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' Terminal Disease ', ' terminal decline ', ' Terminal Illness ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' functional status decline ', ' decline in functional status ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,R01,2018,372213,0.03844984813942414
"Enhancing Leadership Capacity to Mentor Scientists in Translational Behavioral AD-Related Research Project Summary Community-engaged research, focusing on patient-centered outcomes (PCO), is critical in translating scientific evidence into health benefits for the aging US population. There’s limited focus on understanding associations of sleep with brain health and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among older adults, particularly minorities who are disproportionately burdened by Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Consistent with the NIH roadmap of translating research into practice, it is paramount that health professionals be trained to pursue careers in PCO that promote healthy aging. The K07 leadership award will serve as (a) a collaborative learning laboratory and (b) a resource to stimulate, support, and evaluate high-priority translational aging research in diverse communities. It will coalesce a network of renowned investigators to tackle adverse sleep-related CVD outcomes in a diverse aging population. It will also address a critical deficiency in the academic workforce by mentoring junior scientists to pursue careers in translational behavioral research and to become effective mentors. The plan builds upon Dr. Jean-Louis’ leadership in implementing community research and mentoring programs. Its strong likelihood of success is anchored by his outstanding experience engaging multiple stakeholders supporting aging-related research initiatives. The K07 plan will be implemented in an outstanding academic environment for translational behavioral research. It leverages several NYU resources, particularly those of the CTSI, the Center for Healthful Behavior Change, the Center for Brain Health, and the Sleep Disorders Center. Other enhancements to this environment include: 1) a community-academic partnership with a shared aging research agenda aiming to address important health needs of older adults, 2) access to a pool of 83 PRIDE scientists who will be coached to become Peer Mentors, and 3) Dr. Jean-Louis’ leadership in a new fellowship program in translational behavioral sciences in NYU’s Department of Population Health. Dr. Jean-Louis’ research program comprises several trials ascertaining effectiveness of tailored interventions to increase adoption of sleep health messages. These are complemented by use of mix-methods approaches to study psychosocial and cultural factors affecting health practices in diverse communities. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Provide a forum in which mid- to senior-level investigators in aging research will congregate to forge interdisciplinary collaborations, leading to submission of innovative research proposals; 2) Select and mentor 12 postdoctoral URM scientists with potential to become innovative and creative leaders in the scientific community, applying translational behavioral models to promote healthy aging; and 3) Coach 12 scientists who recently graduated from NYU’s PRIDE Institute to become Peer Mentors. This award will have a strong impact in increasing the academic workforce in sleep and ethnogerontological research. Project Narrative The K07 leadership award will coalesce a network of renowned investigators to tackle pressing adverse sleep-related CVD and brain health outcomes in a diverse aging population, with a focus on those with Alzheimer’s disease.

"Center for Improving Care Delivery for the Aging (CICADA) Delivering high-quality, accessible, and affordable health care to older Americans is fundamental to their health, wellbeing, function, and independence. Yet, with a growing chronic disease burden, rapid growth of health care costs, and fragmentation of care delivery, aging Americans are increasingly finding that high- quality care is not available, accessible, or affordable. The health care system in the United States (US) is not organized to address the fundamental health needs of older Americans. Moreover, the persistence of health disparities in the US, particularly for minority elders, suggests that health system dysfunction affects this population disproportionately. There is a critical need to reorganize and reorient health care delivery to coordinate care; maintain and improve quality of life as populations age; address inequities and health disparities; and implement new models of payment rewarding the value of care rather than the volume of care.  Health services research (HSR) studies the organization, financing, and delivery of health care, providing an evidence base that is central to addressing issues of care quality, access, affordability, and equity. HSR is critical to identifying and implementing solutions to improve the current shortcomings of health care delivery and, thus, the health and wellbeing of aging Americans. As a discipline, HSR has been a cornerstone of identifying and addressing disparities in health and health care delivery.  Minority investigators are underrepresented in HSR, with Blacks and Hispanics accounting for only 6.9% and 3.7%, respectively, of the HSR workforce. Yet underrepresented HSR researchers bring essential diverse perspectives and, often, personal experiences to bear in understanding the social, economic, political, and environmental determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care. Furthermore, according to the federal Office of Minority Health, underrepresentation in research leads to underfunding of health research as well as a lack of culturally appropriate theories, models, and methodologies. Thus, developing a representative cadre of researchers who can undertake studies that address the challenges facing our aging population and, in particular, disparities in aging, is an absolute priority.  To address this need, we propose the Center for Improving Care Delivery for the Aging (CICADA), a Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). CICADA aims to train emerging scientists from underrepresented backgrounds in the interdisciplinary science of HSR as it applies to the most pressing issues for aging Americans, particularly minority elders. Redressing researchers from backgrounds underrepresentation in HSR is critical to finding innovative public health solutions, creating a robust learning environment, and developing the trust needed to implement innovative solutions in minority populations.

"Metabolic and Inflammatory Pathways of Midlife Neurocognitive Disparities Project Summary/Abstract Health is not randomly distributed across people or across space: it tracks a socioeconomic gradient that extends from individuals to the areas in which they live. Individual- and area-level attributes of socioeconomic disadvantage confer risk for a broad range of interrelated physical and neurocognitive health outcomes. This risk is especially apparent in midlife when pathophysiological trajectories of neurocognitive aging that predict risk for dementia in later life begin to accelerate. In this regard, we have provided some of the first evidence that individual- and area- level socioeconomic disadvantage associate with reduced cortical tissue volume and white matter integrity, aspects of brain morphology that show normative shrinkage and integrity loss with age in association with poorer cognitive outcomes. Pathways linking socioeconomic disadvantage to accelerated neurocognitive aging remain unclear. Recent evidence, including our own, suggests that metabolic factors may play a role. Individuals who develop metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for accelerated neurocognitive aging. Furthermore, our recent cross-sectional findings suggest that metabolic risk factors contribute to the associations of area-level disadvantage with brain morphology among midlife adults. Here, we aim to extend this work by longitudinally examining metabolic pathways linking individual- and area-level disadvantage to neurocognitive aging across a 10 year period of midlife. For this purpose, we propose reassessing a sample of 300 cognitively normal midlife adults on whom we collected baseline measures of socioeconomic parameters, metabolic risk, brain morphology and cognitive function 9-10 years ago (mean age at follow-up = 52). Our primary aims examine whether individual- and area-level measures of socioeconomic disadvantage predict changes in brain morphology and cognitive function that decline with age and whether associations of disadvantage with neurocognitive aging are explained by metabolic risk and associated inflammation. We anticipate that this study will contribute to new knowledge to the neurobiology of disparities in cognitive aging. Project Narrative As the US population ages, cognitive impairment is becoming a rising and intractable problem, particularly for individuals at relative socioeconomic disadvantage who are at increased risk for premature neurocognitive aging and dementia. The public health implications of the proposed research include the potential to identify modifiable risk factors that track a socioeconomic gradient and predict preclinical cognitive decline across mid-life, a period when differential trajectories of cognitive aging begin. The project focus is on metabolic risk factors that associate with disadvantage and may accelerate preclinical brain aging and cognitive decline.",Metabolic and Inflammatory Pathways of Midlife

"Healthcare stereotype threat, health disparities, and minority aging PROJECT SUMMARY Health disparities among aging African Americans and Latinos are substantial and persistent. 1 With large segments of these populations living in poverty, healthcare access and quality are major contributors to their disproportionate burdens of disease, disability, and death. Yet, African American and Latino later life health disparities persist even in higher socioeconomic contexts. 2 This suggests that, in addition to economic barriers, there are psychosocial barriers to healthcare resource use, or utilization, and, thus, good health among aging minorities. The purpose of the proposed career development and research is to provide new understanding of later life health disparities by examining a previously overlooked psychosocial barrier to care among aging minorities, namely healthcare stereotype threat (HCST), 3-9 and how it can be ameliorated. Stereotype threat is the threat of being personally reduced to a group stereotype, 10-13 which can lead individuals to avoid stereotype-relevant domains. 10-12 For example, females have been shown to avoid STEM fields, leadership roles, and other stereotypically male domains to avoid stereotypes of inferiority and their negative social and psychological consequences. 14,15 My central hypothesis is that stereotypes regarding unhealthy lifestyles, low status, and inferior intelligence are salient for aging minorities in healthcare settings and influence healthcare resource use and health outcomes. The first of its kind, the proposed research will investigate the research questions of whether and how HCST contributes to disparities in healthcare resource use and health in aging African Americans and Latinos as compared to Whites. The approach is informed by Stereotype Threat Theory3,9,10,16,17 and my Culture and Social Identity Health Theory. 18 Specific Aims are threefold: (1) To document the association of ethnicity/race-based and age-based HCST to cross- sectional and longitudinal healthcare resource use and health outcomes among African American, Latino, and White older adults; (2) To use randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine economic and other moderators of the link between HCST and perceptions of the healthcare environment, including healthcare resource quality; and (3) To use RCT to examine how matching patients and physicians on race/ethnicity and/or age impacts the association between HCST and perceptions of healthcare resource quality. The proposed research design consists of three studies, employs a combination of survey and experimental methods, and involves both primary data collection and secondary data analysis. An assistant professor of Gerontology and Psychology at the University of Southern California, I (Candidate: Abdou) possess interdisciplinary expertise in psychology, social epidemiology, population health, and lifespan and intergenerational health disparities. This NIA K01 will provide the unique opportunity to augment my current expertise with training in health economics, health services research, and advanced training in stereotype threat and statistical and research methods (i.e., longitudinal data, RCT). Alongside my strong interdisciplinary mentorship team, I will receive the necessary support and training to work toward my long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program, including development of a successful NIH R01, to reduce later life health disparities and improve minority aging through the reduction of HCST and its sociocultural and psychobiological consequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research and training are aligned with NIA priorities, the NIH mission, and U.S. Healthy People 2020 goals to improve quantity and quality of life for all people. Expected positive impacts include the creation of stereotype-safer healthcare environments and the reduction of health disparities among aging minorities.","Healthcare stereotype threat, health

"NATIONAL HEALTH AND AGING TRENDS STUDY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to continue the National Health and Aging Trend Study (NHATS), which aims (1) to promote scientific inquiry into late-life disability trends and dynamics, their antecedents and correlates, and disparities therein and (2) to advance study of the social and economic consequences of late-life disability for individuals, families, and society. To achieve these aims, in the next 5-year cycle (2014-2018) we will: (a) Collect data in person from the original NHATS cohort annually, including: continued collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; collection of dried blood spots, some to be assayed to foster study of the biologic risk for disability progression, and others to be stored for future use; enhancements to the NHATS interview in key understudied areas of potentially growing importance-use of rehabilitation services aimed at recovery from disability, and the service environment and related amenities that promote independent functioning in retirement and senior community settings-and incorporating new modules submitted by the broader research community. (b) Replenish the sample in Round 5 (2015). Replenishment will be implemented in such a way that NHATS maintains the ability to produce 5-year age estimates (including 90+) and Black-White comparisons. (c) Clean, document and disseminate public use files online and continue to make Medicare claims and other sensitive and restricted files available using established procedures. (d) Undertake methodological studies to improve the efficiency of data collection in future rounds, including testing the sensitivity of key estimates to differential follow-up periods and applying modern measurement approaches such as Item Response Theory (IRT) to measures of capacity. The overarching goal of NHATS is to be a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life. Research using NHATS will foster research to design multi-factor interventions to reduce late-life disability, and will support comprehensive modeling of outcomes of the disability process including living and care arrangements, expenditures, economic well-being, and quality of life.

"Costa P01Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging  OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - Project Summary/Abstract Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging This program project is a competitive continuation of Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death. Since its inception in 1991, EI has made many discoveries about the longitudinal determinants of retirement and of chronic disease and death at older ages by studying aging processes among Union Army veterans of the US Civil War, a group that mostly reached age 65 between 1885 and 1912. Among these discoveries are "" health at older ages, particularly for African-Americans, was worse than previously thought; "" retirement responsiveness to income transfers was greater than expected; "" social networks affected not just behavior but also health; and, "" stressful events in early life and at young adult ages reduced longevity, but extreme stress after age 30 left  a more robust population. These discoveries were possible because of the creation of longitudinal data sets that follow more than 67,000 Union Army recruits from military service back to childhood and forward to death and contain about 15,000 observations per person. This competitive continuation will take the next step by examining the inter- generational determinants of later longevity and socioeconomic status. The overarching purpose of this continuation is to gain a more precise understanding of 1) how inter- generational processes affect aging and longevity and 2) the mechanisms through which parents transmit socioeconomic status and longevity to their children. Data collected for this continuation will support the research aims outlined in this proposal and will also be made publicly available. We propose two cores and three new scientific projects, which will create intergenerational databases from Early Indicators data: Project #1: Intergenerational Processes and Aging of White Americans Project #2: Intergenerational Processes and Aging of African-Americans Project #3: Intergenerational Processes and Aging in Multiple Generations Core A (Administrative) and B (Data Development) will support data collection, research, and dissemination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the determinants of a long and healthy life has both scientific and policy implications. It can provide insights into future longevity and health trends; into the ages at which health and human capital investments may be most effective; and into ways that intergenerational factors may lead to the persistence of inequality in longevity, health, and socioeconomic status by race.            ","Costa P01Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging",9481220,P01AG010120,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Attitude ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cohort Effect ', ' Generation Effect ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Future ', ' Genealogy ', ' Geneologies ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Experience ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Military Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Prisoner ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Retirement ', ' Shock ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' War ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' Left ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Distant ', ' Soldier ', ' Services ', ' environmental stressor ', ' intergenerational ', ' family structure ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' Documentation ', ' research data dissemination ', ' research dissemination ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' human capital ', ' dissemination research ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' user-friendly ', ' public health relevance ', ' health inequalities ', ' policy implication ', ' project dissemination ', ' program dissemination ', ' internet portal ', ' web portal ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' well being trends ', ' Wellness trends ', ' Wellbeing trends ', ' Health trends ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2018,2088806,0.13178243122553399
"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9423915,R01AG057704,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Certificates ', ' Demography ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Hand ', ' Handwriting ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Marriage ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sanitation ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Toxin ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccines ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Inequality ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' health knowledge ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' intergenerational ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' cohort ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Maiden Name ', ' Maiden ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' suicide rate ', ' cost ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' population health ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' data resource ', ' early-life nutrition ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,325845,0.15595127043171572
"Origin of Chronic Diseases of Aging Among Rural African American Young Adults PROJECT SUMMARY  The current proposal builds upon an ongoing investigation to test hypotheses about (1) the role of psychosocial stressors in “weathering” young bodies, (2) the protective factors that may mitigate their adverse impact, and (3) the role of continuity and change in weathering during a key life course transition. Tests of these hypotheses will enable a better understanding of the role of weathering in forecasting chronic diseases of aging (CDAs) among rural African Americans and set the stage for prevention programming for this vulnerable population. Using recently-developed, direct measures of biological weathering we have found that, by age 20, some SHAPE youth are already experiencing accelerated aging due to psychosocial context. The transition to adulthood provides an opportunity to examine the impact of both new and continuing sources of risk and resilience on weathering and ultimately on CDA vulnerability during this important transition period, allowing us to closely examine the potential for adverse and protective experiences to “bend” the risk curve for future CDAs and so illuminate key targets for preventive intervention. Here, we request funds to supplement the SHAPE study by using blood from an ongoing NICHD-sponsored data collection protocol to characterize each participant's “epigenetic clock” at age 26, providing a key window on weathering and changes in weathering and so allow us to conduct enhanced tests of theory and to more accurately identify high value targets for preventive intervention. By adding this assessment we will have a data set with measures of biological weathering at age 20 and age 26, along with a full complement of indicators of metabolic syndrome, a precursor to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This assessment will place no additional burden on SHAPE participants and will substantially increase the public health value of the data set. First, we will examine the impact of exposure to multidimensional SES- and race-related stressors during the transition to adulthood on changes in biological weathering. We expect exposure to stressors, particularly racial discrimination, to play a key role in maintaining or accelerating weathering processes across young adulthood and to presage CDA vulnerability (i.e. metabolic risk and inflammation). Second, we will identify positive, protective influences, both inside and outside the family, that help shift African American young adults off the above-mentioned trajectory to CDAs. We anticipate that these factors will be especially important for young adults who enter the transition to adulthood with already-accelerated weathering. The results of the proposed study will inform the development of preventive interventions designed to slow biological weathering and promote health for a population at high risk for early development of CDAs. By examining not only risk factors for accelerated aging but also protective environments and coping processes that presage a deceleration of biological aging across young adulthood, we will have the necessary ingredients for a new generation of prevention programs designed specifically to deter weathering and promote the health and well-being of rural African Americans, thereby addressing well-documented health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans coping with the challenges of rural Southern environments experience accelerated biological aging that contributes to earlier onset of chronic diseases, like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Understanding and preventing the emergence of these disparities during key transitions, like the transition to adulthood, requires attention to both change and continuity. By adding a second assessment of a key construct, the data provided by the current study will allow examination of change and continuity in biological aging, informing the development of prevention programs designed to deter accelerated biological aging and ultimately chronic diseases.",Origin of Chronic Diseases of Aging Among Rural African American Young Adults,9442921,R01HD091046,"['Acceleration ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronology ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Collection ', ' Deceleration ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Life Experience ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Triglycerides ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Biological Aging ', ' Mediating ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' heuristics ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' early onset ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' stem ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' racial identity ', ' rural African American ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2018,536971,0.0779393631556052
"Biological mechanisms of risk and resiliency in brain aging among ethnic minorities Abstract Minority health disparities have been well documented in the United States. These disparities exist in the domains of access to healthcare and participation in health research. Ethnic minorities in the United States also have increased risk of cardio- and cerebrovascular disease, stroke, and dementia. It is also known that lifestyle differences (such as exercise and nutrition habits), lower socioeconomic status, and diabetes are risk factors. With the increasing proportion of ethnic minorities in the United States, it is imperative to better understand disease processes that have historically been studied in Caucasian populations. The proportion of elderly that are Hispanic is expected to double, or even triple, in the coming decades. With an increasing population fraction, and increasing life expectancy, it is projected that upwards of a 6-fold increase in Alzheimer's disease will occur in Hispanics. Establishing the trust and partnership between Hispanic communities and world-class researchers is paramount to enable large-scale studies in order to diminish the disparity in minority health research. Our goal is to establish a collaborative foundation between the local minority communities and our research group at the University of Utah. This foundation will greatly facilitate ethnic minority participation in state-of-the-art genetic analysis, such as the newly developed technique of epigenetic aging, and advanced brain imaging research. Succeeding in this goal will allow us to begin to understand the specific risk and resiliency factors related to brain aging in the Hispanic community. The scope of the current project will establish a partnership between local Hispanic communities (approximately 75% Mexican-American) in the Salt Lake City region, neuroimaging researchers at the University of Utah, and collaborators at UCLA. The project will leverage existing university resources, such as the Community/Patient Engagement Studio, to bring the project team members, community stakeholders, and communities in an equal partnership to establish the foundation to perform state-of- the-art genetic and neuroimaging research. The project will synergistically work with local communities to reduce barriers for participation in research. Success of this project will open up avenues that will lead to large-scale studies utilizing cutting edge genetic (epigenetic aging), and neuroimaging techniques that have been applied in studies of Caucasians related to brain aging and Alzheimer's. Utilization of these advanced tools will allow for much-needed research into early signs of brain risk, as well as resiliency, in the Hispanic population. The derived engagement and recruitment strategies, along with these data will form the basis of a future, large-scale study to examine the Alzheimer's disease process in Hispanic-Americans. Narrative Minority health disparities exist in access to healthcare and access to health research. This project will utilize innovative participant engagement strategies, developed in collaboration with Hispanic communities leaders and Hispanic communities in the Salt Lake City region with the purpose of engaging these communities in state-of-the-art genetic and neuroimaging research relevant to aging and Alzheimer's disease. We will specifically work synergistically with these leaders and communities to lower barriers for this ethnic minority group to participate in critical health research.",Biological mechanisms of risk

"South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research Undergraduate Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of South Carolina (USC) proposes to establish a South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (SC-ADAR) undergraduate program to increase the number of qualified underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students who pursue scientific graduate studies in programs focusing on science and aging. We are partnering with five Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in South Carolina (SC). The decision to focus on HBCUs was made as HBCUs have a high concentration of low-income, African American undergraduate students, many of whom are majoring in MSTEM fields, and might, through exposure to a research education program focusing on aging research, choose to enter scientific careers committed to addressing the complex biological, biomedical, behavioral, and clinical challenges that accompany aging. The proposed SC-ADAR leverages the Dual PIs' and USC's extensive experience in providing training in aging and MSTEM research for underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students across the continuum of education, from high-school through graduate school and further professional advancement. In addition, the proposed program will draw on USC's long history of collaborating with South Carolina's HBCUs in the development of educational programs for undergraduates in the STEM fields. Specific program aims include: 1) recruiting HBCU undergraduates majoring in STEM fields from five participating HBCUs in SC; 2) implementing a 24-month research education program, including: hands-on mentored research experiences in a research laboratory at USC; co-mentoring system with USC and HBCU faculty; summer coursework on aging; opportunities for joint-learning with other students; academic advising; and career/professional development activities that will assist students in applying to graduate studies in NIA MSTEM fields and professional development activities that will assist HBCU faculty mentors in career advancement in NIA MSTEM research; 3) conducting a process evaluation (to make iterative improvements in the program) and a summative evaluation to measure short-term outcomes (competencies in NIH MSTEM fields and completion of undergraduate degree in MSTEM field) and intermediate-term outcomes (application and transitioning to graduate studies/medical school); and 4) evaluating the success of the program in increasing the capacity and intention of HBCU faculty mentors to conduct research in NIA MSTEM fields. The likelihood of success is enhanced by strong institutional support from USC, USC's existing infrastructure for advancing diversity in STEM, and through the experience of the Dual PIs, with their backgrounds in research training in aging (Dr. Sue Levkoff) and the STEM (Dr. Alan White) fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed SC-ADAR institutional Research Education program seeks to address the lack of diversity among scientific experts in the aging field as well as the need for expanded basic and clinical research on health disparities among the aging population. Success in attaining the program aims will contribute to our long-term goal of attaining a diverse workforce of basic and clinical scientists to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse and older population.",South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research Undergraduate Program,9523121,R25AG050484,"['Aging ', ' Career Mobility ', ' career transition ', ' career advancement ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Graduate Education ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' South Carolina ', ' Students ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Competence ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' educationally disadvantaged ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' social ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', "" Bachelor's Degree "", ' Undergraduate Degree ', ' Baccalaureate Degree ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Older Population ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' STEM major ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM class ', ' STEM field ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics ', ' undergraduate education ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Educational counseling ', ' Admissions Counseling ', ' Academic guidance ', ' Academic counseling ', ' Academic advising ', ' faculty mentor ', ' matriculation ', ' education research ', ' Workplace Diversity ', ' Diverse Workforce ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' minority student ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R25,2018,352650,0.10127148386590482
"Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research: This project will create five different one-day conferences on current NIA initiatives that are relevant to minority aging research. The goal of the proposed conference series is to increase the quality, quantity, and relevance to communities of color of NIA-fundable research by providing both junior and senior researchers with new knowledge and greater interest in these emerging issues as they apply to minority elderly. This is significant because the number and proportion of the U.S. older population from racial and ethnic minority communities is growing rapidly: minorities will increase from 20% to over 40% of the older population between 2010 and 2050. Protecting and improving the health of these elderly requires a highly skilled research workforce with interests and capabilities in this area to produce new and useful knowledge. Yet the number and success of minority researchers funded by NIH is insufficient. The NIA's Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) program works to mentor and train junior faculty who conduct research on minority aging to strengthen the next generation of NIA-funded ethnic and racial minority researchers. The conferences will focus on: Cognitive health disparities research and national policy, Use of well-being measures in minority aging research and policy analyses, Stigma in minority aging research, Mutability and reversibility of risk factors across diverse populations, and Concepts and measures of stress and resilience for minority aging research. Each will feature leading scholars on the topic, top scholars on minority aging, and representatives from multiple NIA-funded centers and networks. The programs will disseminate the state of the art on the topic, inform researchers on how existing research needs to be modified or expanded to be more valid and relevant for minority elders, and provide tools that can be used by researchers to further develop the fields in research with minority elders. The conferences will be held as preconferences to the Gerontological Society of America (GSA) annual scientific meetings. There will be at least 50 participants at each conference and the majority will be minorities and/or women. The planning committee will be compromised of the confirmed keynote speakers who are leaders in the field, researchers from RCMAR sites with expertise in the topic, and members of other NIA-funded networks. The executive committee will be the RCMAR directors group. The project is innovative in the topics covered, the research networks involved, and the synergy with GSA. Program evaluation includes a process evaluation, a retrospective pre/post knowledge and confidence survey, and four-month follow-up survey on conference impacts. The lead investigators are national leaders in minority aging and gerontological education who have successfully led 11 previous GSA preconferences that reached over 600 researchers. This proposal is a renewal of the previous successful series with new topics but similar objectives of improving the knowledge and interest in emerging issues supported by NIA among RCMAR Scholars and faculty as well as among others with research agendas in minority aging and related issues; and raising awareness of how minority aging issues intersect these priority topics to promote research in the cutting edge issues. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older adults from racial and ethnic minorities communities often experience health risks and respond to health interventions differently than non-Hispanic whites. Understanding how to maximize the health of all older adults requires researchers who are knowledgeable about the theories, methods, and existing science relevant to minority elders. This conference series will educate researchers about the state of the art in emerging areas of NIA-funded research critical to population health and provide them with skills and motivation to expand that research in minority communities, increasing its relevance to the groups that will soon comprise 40% of the older adult population.",Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research,9462718,R13AG023033,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Exercise ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Peer Review ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' journal article ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stream ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' Distance Learning ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Committee Members ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' stress resilience ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' skill development ', ' skill acquisition ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' public health relevance ', ' biodemography ', ' population health ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Education Module ', ' Learning Module ', ' faculty research ', ' racial minority ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' online compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' internet resource ', ' online resource ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R13,2018,50000,0.08785054622227782
"Midcareer Mentoring Award for Patient-Oriented Research in Aging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My over-arching career goals as a geriatrician and clinical investigator are to conduct high quality patient- oriented research in aging and palliativ care, train the next generation of investigators to conduct this research and through my research and mentoring activities improve the health care of older persons living with advanced illness. Over the past 16 years, I have built a successful research program focused on outcomes, decision-making, and health care utilization in advanced dementia. My initial K24 was awarded in 2009. My productivity during its course is evident through the high impact of my research, mentees' accomplishments, and my leadership roles. Building on this success, I feel am at an optimal time to renew this award. The observational studies I have conducted to date have clearly shown that advanced dementia patients receive sub-optimal palliative care, but also elucidated opportunities for improvement. Designing and testing interventions targeting those opportunities is the current priority for the field, and the focus of my research during this K24 renewal. The initial K24 period was critical in providing the protected time needed to be an effective mentor, gain mentoring skills, and build a cadre of young investigators skilled in palliative care aging research. Renewal of my K24 is essential for this momentum to continue. The objectives for my 5-year K24 renewal period are: 1. To continue to build a research program focused on improving the quality of care for older patients with advanced dementia, with a new direction on clinical trials. This will be accomplished by: i. completion of currently funded observational studies, ii. new research involving cluster randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing practice interventions in advanced dementia, and iii. formal training activities to deepen my expertise in clinical trials research; 2. To use my research as a platform to mentor new investigators in aging-related palliative care research to help them become independent investigators and support the expansion of my research program and the field with highly trained faculty. This will be accomplished by: i. involvement of my trainees in my funded projects, ii. leveraging my research infrastructure to enable my mentees' investigations. iii. recruitment of high caliber mentees from varied disciplines committed to this field, iv. individual mentorship of these trainees in their research activities and career development, v. didactic sessions and formal coursework for mentees. IMPACT: The focus of my new research, career development and mentorship in clinical trials is the next necessary step to move the field of advanced dementia forward. The findings, methodological advancements, and infrastructure gained through this work, can be leveraged for the next phase of research translation: implementation and dissemination of proven interventions. Ultimately, my ongoing and new research proposed for the second cycle of my K24, coupled with my training of outstanding investigators in the field of palliative care and aging, and will help address the critical and pressing need to bring high quality and cost-effective palliative care to the bedside of the millions of older Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With the renewal of this k24 award, Dr. Susan Mitchell will continue to develop her successful research program aimed at improving the end-of-life experience of persons with advanced dementia and their families, with a new focus on the conduct of clinical trials research. She will use her research as a platform to mentor new investigators in field of palliative care and aging, and help them to become independent investigators.

"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: renewal 2014 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for competitive funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for the period 2014 - 2020. ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), and recruited 12,100 men and women aged 50 and above who were representative of the older population of England. ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with half of the funding coming from a consortium of UK Government Departments. This renewal request is to fund three waves of data collection - waves 7 (2014/15), 8 (2016/17), and 9 (2018/19) - and associated analyses. The central objective is to provide the high quality data necessary for an exploration of the dynamic relationships between health and functioning, economic position, social participation, wellbeing, cognitive function and health as people plan for, move into and progress beyond retirement. ELSA is a multidisciplinary study, involving the collection of economic, epidemiological, health, social, psychological, physiological and genetic data. The phase of data collection planned in this application will greatly increase the potential for longitudinal analyses so as to examine causal process.  The research agenda of this application is focused on the following broad issues that are important scientifically while also being relevant to policy: comparisons of trajectories of health and wellbeing in England, the USA, and other countries; the determinants of economic wellbeing in older age; the nature and timing of retirement and post-retirement labor market activity; the interaction between psychosocial, genetic, and biological determinants of health and mortality; cognitive functioning and its impact on decision making among older people; disability and the compression of morbidity; the implications of mild cognitive impairment for social, economic and subjective wellbeing; economic, social and health inequalities in an ageing population; social participation and social productivity at older ages; intergenerational relationships and generativity; and health care utilization and transitions to social care.  The specific objectives of the new proposal are to: 1.

"Improving the Health of Low-SES Americans Approaching Retirement Under the Affordable Care Act PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Renuka Tipirneni, MD, MSc is a general internist and junior health services researcher focused on improving the health care system for prematurely aging low socioeconomic status (SES) adults approaching retirement age. Dr. Tipirneni's long-term career objective is to become an independent mixed methods investigator integrating large-scale clinical and economic data with in-depth qualitative data to inform the design and evaluation of policies and programs to improve the health of low-SES aging adults. Research Context: Low-SES Americans approaching retirement face a crisis of poor health and markedly increasing mortality. Between 2001 and 2014, disparities in life expectancy between low- and high-SES adults near retirement have widened and this may have accounted for 500,000 excess deaths. Yet the drivers of this crisis are poorly understood. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) should improve access to care through insurance expansions and care delivery innovations and help this group manage chronic conditions and improve their health. However, it is not clear how low-SES aging adults are specifically benefitting from ACA policies, which groups should be principally targeted for new care delivery programs encouraged under the ACA, and what factors are associated with successful health improvement and decreased costs for at-risk aging Americans. Specific Aims: 1) Determine changes in coverage, access, utilization, health and financial stress for low-SES 55-64-year-olds before and after the ACA Medicaid expansion; 2) Classify sub-groups of low-SES 55-64-year- olds at highest risk of poor health and characterize heterogeneity of changes in access, utilization, health and costs in identified high-risk sub-groups; 3) Identify facilitators of and barriers to improvements in health outcomes and health care utilization among high-risk low-SES aging adults in an ACA care delivery program. Research Plan: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Tipirneni will perform quasi-experimental analyses with the Health and Retirement Study to assess health and health care changes before and after the ACA. She will then identify sub-groups of low-SES near retirement adults at high risk of poor health trajectories. Lastly, she will conduct qualitiatve interviews with low-SES near retirement adults in an ACA care delivery program to identify facilitators of and barriers to health improvement and decreased high-cost utilization. Career Development Plan: Dr. Tipirneni will develop expertise in 1) analysis of large-scale longitudinal survey and administrative data; 2) application of quasi-experimental approaches to evaluate programs; 3) mixed methods research; and 4) programmatic research focused on aging adults. Dr. Tipirneni's career development goals will be supported by close mentorship from an interdisciplinary team; advanced didactic coursework; participation in research and career development meetings/seminars; and ongoing guidance in her research. Environment: The University of Michigan offers the ideal environment for her to pursue this training, with the outstanding guidance of well-established mentors and interdisciplinary institutes dedicated to her success. PROJECT NARRATIVE Low-income Americans approaching retirement age have been increasingly dying at alarming rates compared with higher-income Americans, yet the drivers of this crisis are poorly understood. The Affordable Care Act's new insurance options and health care delivery programs may offer strategies to help at-risk aging Americans, but it is not clear who should be targeted for such policies and programs and which elements are most helpful. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify potentially modifiable risk factors for poor health among these at-risk aging Americans in order to help design and evaluate policies and programs to improve the health of low-SES aging adults.",Improving the Health of Low-SES Americans Approaching Retirement Under the Affordable Care Act,9564804,K08AG056591,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Award ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Premature Aging ', ' Premature aging syndrome ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Internist ', ' Respondent ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Physical Function ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' cohort ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' experimental analysis ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' Medicare claim ', ' patient profile ', ' profiles in patients ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Time trend ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2018,167400,0.11280738603738408
"Summer of Translational Aging Research for Undergraduates (STARU) PROJECT SUMMARY As the population of older adults increases dramatically, age-related illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other degenerative disorders present a great public health burden, currently affecting an estimated to 5.4 million Americans. It is well documented that older adults from ethnic minority and lower socioeconomic backgrounds are at increased risk for AD and other disorders of aging. There is thus an urgent need to increase the number of scientists from diverse backgrounds who are committed to the study of aging and age- related health disparities. The proposed Summer of Translational Aging Research for Undergraduates (STAR U) program is guided by three axioms related to biomedical research on aging: 1. The diversity of the older adult population is increasing and there are systematic racial/ethnic disparities related to disorders of aging that are poorly understood; 2. Scientific advancement relies upon diversity of background, experience, ideas, and perspectives; increasing the diversity of scientists involved with biomedical research of aging is necessary to provide the cultural sensitivity and knowledge to understand sources of disparities in aging; and 3. Despite increases in the number of underrepresented minorities receiving higher education, a large percentage do not pursue careers in science. STAR U seeks to overcome historic barriers that have prevented such students from pursuing careers in scientific and aging research. Through a structured summer research program, STAR U will provide 10-12 students per year with: 1) individual, tailored research mentorships in the neuroscience of aging; 2) a range of translational learning opportunities; and 3) professional networking and social experiences. Research opportunities will span areas such as patient-oriented clinical research, cognitive neuroscience, basic science, and the epidemiological study of cognitive aging and its disorders. STAR U students will gather formally once per week for a two-hour seminar session that will include one hour devoted to a scientific topic, and one hour devoted to professional/academic development. Scientific training will focus on major themes in aging research, research methodologies, and general content areas relevant to developing scientific careers. Personal and professional development will be fostered through social gatherings as well as seminars on career development, learning how to find and work effectively with mentors, balance personal and professional demands, choosing the type of graduate training that is most appropriate for them, communicating effectively in science, and applying to graduate/medical school effectively. The long-term goal of the Summer of Translational Aging Research for Undergraduates is to enhance the field of aging and age-related disparities research by infusing it with diverse, well-trained scientists.!

"Mechanisms of Disparities in Adverse Neurocognitive Outcomes among Hispanics Aging with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY The adverse consequences of HIV and related comorbidities on the central nervous system remain prevalent despite highly effective antiretroviral therapy, with approximately 40% of persons living with HIV showing neurocognitive impairment (NCI). Compared to other ethnic/racial groups in the United States, HIV infected (HIV+) Hispanics/Latinos/as, hereafter referred to as Hispanics, present with increased risk for NCI and neurocognitive decline; and this risk is particularly pronounced in older age. Yet, the factors underlying these disparities are not well understood. Guided by the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework, the present proposal aims to identify key mechanisms underlying adverse neurocognitive outcomes among Hispanics aging with HIV. Among the potential predictors of NCI in this group, the proposed study will focus on two biological processes -- metabolic syndrome and gut microbiome dysbiosis -- that may be particularly problematic among Hispanics and may result in greater brain vulnerability to HIV. The study will also integrate aspects of the physical/built and sociocultural environment (assessed via geocoding) that have been linked to metabolic syndrome and NCI, and investigate their influence on neurocognitive disparities in HIV. We will also explore the impact of behavioral (physical activity and diet) and healthcare (healthcare use and access, health literacy) variables. We will collect these data in 200 HIV+ and HIV-uninfected Hispanics (approximately half Spanish-speaking) aged 40 and over, and investigate their impact on neurocognitive status cross-sectionally and longitudinally over the course of three years. We will leverage existing longitudinal data from the UCSD HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program to select a comparison group of 100 HIV+ non-Hispanic Whites. To ensure the success of the proposed multidisciplinary approach, we have assembled a research team representing an integration of relevant disciplines, including cross-cultural neuropsychology, health disparities, medicine, public health, microbiomics, geography, and bioinformatics, and information systems. Recognizing the importance of a community-based participatory research approach in the study of health disparities, we have partnered with community clinics and stakeholders whose input has helped strengthen our approach and assure its relevance to the community. We will build on existing cross-sectional studies in Hispanics led by the PI for recruitment of participants into the proposed study, and our community partnerships will help assure that we reach the most vulnerable segments of the Hispanic community. With this multidisciplinary and community integrated approach to research, we aim to increase our understanding of the complexity that underlies mechanisms of disparities in neurocognitive outcomes among diverse groups of Hispanics aging with HIV. Such knowledge is crucial for the development of targeted, culturally relevant interventions to prevent or ameliorate HIV-associated NCI among Hispanics and reduce health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed observational longitudinal study aims to determine important mechanisms underlying disparities in neurocognitive outcomes among Hispanics aging with HIV. This is an important public health priority because: 1) the adverse impact of HIV and related comorbidities in the central nervous system are still prevalent and impactful; and 2) HIV-infected Hispanics are at higher risk for neurocognitive impairment, and this disparity is expected to increase with the aging of the HIV-infected population. Understanding factors that increase risk for adverse neurocognitive outcomes associated with HIV and aging among Hispanics may lead to the development of targeted, culturally relevant interventions to prevent and/or decrease HIV-disease progression in the central nervous system among Hispanics and reduce health disparities.",Mechanisms of Disparities in Adverse Neurocognitive Outcomes among Hispanics Aging with HIV,9654469,R01MD013502,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' United States ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' Discipline ', ' Disease Progression ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' success ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Consequences of HIV ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' health literacy ', ' comparison group ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' public health priorities ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' community partnership ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' gut microbiome ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' Longitudinal observation study ', ' Longitudinal observational study ', ' microbiome studies ', ' microbiome science ', ' Microbiomics ', ' microbiome research ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' dysbiotic ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' dysbiosis ', ' Intestinal Hyperpermeability ', ' Intestinal Epithelial Permeability ', ' Gut permeability ', ' Gut Hyperpermeability ', ' Gut Epithelial Permeability ', ' Intestinal permeability ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,693843,0.09219688751565566
"Advancing aging research through development of minority gerontologists DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of establishing the Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR) program at Howard University (HUADAR) is to identify a group of bright minority students from MSTEM disciplines early during their undergraduate years and then through extensive mentoring and training prepare them to successfully compete for graduate studies and other professional careers. By making them familiar with aging research early in their career, this cadre of minority researchers could be made squarely interested about building a career on geriatrics and gerontology. The Rationales for developing an HUADAR program is quite justifiable, for more than a century Howard University is engaged in training underrepresented minority students. About 97% of Howard's mentees are African Americans and National Science Foundation's (NSF) recent ranking put Howard University as the top producer of bachelor's degree recipients who subsequently earned science and engineering doctoral degrees nationally from top-tier research universities. Moreover, with an aggressive recruitment effort, Howard University successfully recruited several faculty members in MSTEM areas who are maintaining an active research programs on various aspects of aging and age related disorders. Therefore, Howard University has the ideal environment to identify a cadre of talented minority scientists early during their undergraduate years and it has the required resources to provide them with a foundation of knowledge and research skills through mentoring so that these students will excel in the interdisciplinary field of gerontology. Trainee compositio for HUADAR program will include 100% underrepresented minorities. Approximately 7,000 undergraduate students enroll at Howard in 29 undergraduate departments and programs, approximately 97% of enrollees are African American and 67% are women. Furthermore, 20% (or 1,400) major in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering and Allied Health with greater than 80% declaring medicine as their career goal. We plan to recruit five students from MSTEM disciplines each year by selecting them early at the end of their freshman year using a recruitment strategy which includes: a) identification of strong performing students in the introductory courses, b) students enrolled in the Honors Program, c) recommendations by faculty members, and d) students responding to advertisements, announcements, and oral presentations. Proposed training is a comprehensive research education plan designed for HUADAR trainees which consists of following components: (1) develop two new courses on aging, (2) exposure to aging research in various laboratories at Howard during sophomore and junior years, (3) attending research seminars by prominent gerontologists, (4) a summer research apprenticeship opportunity outside Howard University in leading research institutes on aging like NIA Baltimore, UT Health Sciences Center, Johns Hopkins, Georgetown University Medical Centers, University of Maryland and University of Washington, (5) writing a honors thesis/senior thesis during senior year, (6) provide one on one mentoring to build a successful career path. Thus, from their sophomore year up to the senior year we have a carefully laid out plans to educate the HUADAR trainees on different aspects of aging research including the social aspects of aging. All students and personnel will be required to participate in instruction on the Responsible Conduct of Research. Evaluation plan for HUADAR will consist of course evaluations, student performances, faculty efficacy surveys, summer research experience surveys, successful completion of an honors thesis/senior thesis. The long-term goal of HUADAR program is to prepare minority students as future researchers through scientific training and educational experiences and we will encourage them to seek aging research as a career goal. Thus we will embrace the goal of NIA ADAR initiative to ""fill a gap in the pipeline transitioning from undergraduate to graduate education in aging as it relates to medicine, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to fulfill the objectives of the NIA Health Disparities Strategic Plan"". PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By 2030 we will be living in an America with 1 in 5 American 65 years or older. The ethnic minority portion of our population is growing at an amazing pace from 4.3 million persons in 1990 to 22.5 million expected by the year 2050. This nation needs to be prepared to deal with ethnically diverse minority elderlies who will account for more than 15% of older persons by 2020 and more than 21% of older persons by 2050. Since health disparity among the ethnically diverse minority population is real and we have to deal with it immediately.

"USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR) Overall Project Summary Advances in medicine and technology are providing for longer and healthier lives today much more than in the past. Yet with longevity comes new public health concerns about age-related diseases and conditions. Moreover, health indicators have demonstrated little improvement in health disparities between different racial and ethnic populations over the past decades. Indeed, many of the health and economics issues associated with the aging process are of such magnitude and complexity that they cannot be understood from the vantage point of any single discipline alone. Against this backdrop, the Minority Aging Health Economics Research Center (the University of Southern California Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research, “USC RCMAR”) brings together an interdisciplinary team to provide infrastructure and resources to increase the number, diversity and success of researchers focusing on the health and economic well being of the elderly with the goal of improving the health, well-being, function, and independence of all older Americans. We will build upon its successful 5 year history, during which it has supported 15 pilots and 92 papers involving 13 scientists at USC, 1 scientist at the Spelman College, 1 scientist at Vanderbilt University and 1 scientist at Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The mission of the Minority Aging Health Economics Research Center (the University of Southern California Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research, “USC RCMAR”) is to increase the diversity and success of researchers focusing on the health and economic well being of the elderly with the goal of improving the health, well-being, function, and independence of diverse older Americans. The proposed RCMAR’s target research areas are the differences across racial and ethnic groups of elderly in health and health care usage with an emphasis is on using longitudinal survey and claims based data sources to identify causal pathways: i.e. (1) social, economic and environmental factors driving disparities in physical disease and cognitive functioning; and (2) health consequences of disparities in medical care and pharmaceutical utilization. The USC RCMAR is housed in the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, which brings together 40 health policy experts across the University—including faculty from Gerontology, Engineering, Law, Public Policy, Pharmacy, Medicine, and Arts & Letters. This proposed Center will utilize the resources of National Institute on Aging Centers including Roybal Center for Health Policy Simulation, Roybal Institute on Aging, Roybal Center for Financial Decision Making and Financial Independence in Old Age, Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Center for the Study of Health Inequality, USC/UCLA Biodemography and Population Health; and other USC Centers including Brookings Institute/Schaeffer Initiative, USC Center for Economic and Social Research, and the Schaeffer Center.

"Center for Aging in Diverse Communities: Ending Health Inequities in Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC), an NIA- funded RCMAR since 1997, conducts research, training, and mentoring in minority aging and health disparities research. CADC offers a rich, multidisciplinary environment with social, behavioral, epidemiological, cognitive neuroscience, statistical, and internal medicine faculty providing mentoring and training support. The San Francisco Bay Area provides access to a wide range of diverse racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and sexual and gender minority older adult populations. Our on-going studies with diverse rural and urban communities and solid relationships with over 100 community and clinical partners serving older adult disparity populations provide applied laboratories for mentoring. Our research theme addresses two NIA priorities: (1) understanding mechanisms of health disparities and developing effective interventions to reduce them; and (2) to develop infrastructure for high quality research. Since 1997, CADC has mentored over 90 minority underrepresented early investigators who have made significant contributions to minority aging research. In the past 5-year funding cycle, we mentored 25 minority early investigators and funded 26 pilot projects. Our cores will continue within the new RCMAR organizational framework. The Administrative Core (AC) will coordinate integration of the cores, selection of CADC Scientists, reporting, and external advisors. The Research & Education Component (REC) will provide continual mentorship and pilot study funding for CADC Scientists. The Analysis Core (AnC) will advance and disseminate methodological resources and measures for minority aging and health disparities research. The Community Liaison & Recruitment Core (CLRC) will enhance recruitment and retention and promote engagement of diverse communities in research. Our CADC cores contribute jointly and uniquely to mentoring and training CADC Scientists and others in conducting research to resolve the challenging issues facing our older adult disparity populations. CADC's aims are to: (1) select 3-4 CADC Scientists (underrepresented junior investigators) per year, provide them with pilot study funding, and mentor them to develop independent research careers in health disparities and minority aging research; (2) develop and disseminate (a) methods for conducting interventions to ameliorate disparities among older adults, (b) methods for developing/selecting measures appropriate for disparity populations, and (c) methodological resources on advanced research and statistical methods; and (3) advance the science of community engagement and recruitment to increase participation of disparity populations in research, and mentor CADC Scientists on these methods. CADC will contribute to diversifying the workforce by promoting the expertise and careers of exceptionally talented underrepresented CADC Scientists to develop independent research careers. The cumulative experience, commitment to health equity, and professional networks of CADC Faculty and Scientists in the research and local communities ensures that we will achieve these aims. NARRATIVE For 20 years, the UCSF Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) has been dedicated to eliminating health disparities in minority aging populations. Our research focuses on understanding health disparities and building and testing community-engaged interventions to reduce disparities among older adults. Our most important mission is to train and mentor talented, underrepresented junior investigators to develop independent research careers focused on health disparities and aging issues. Our mentoring is informed and optimized by our research, community partnerships, diverse local populations, and decades of mentoring experience.",Center for Aging in Diverse Communities: Ending Health Inequities in Older Adults,9532484,P30AG015272,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' California ', ' Capsicum ', ' pepper ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Laboratories ', ' Locales ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' effective intervention ', ' health equity ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' speed networking ', ' professional networking ', ' career fair ', ' career networking ', ' community building ', ' faculty community ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",P30,2018,555129,0.03614622747317955
"Contextual and Health Behavior Effects on Epigenetic Aging Among African Americans ABSTRACT: Considerable evidence exists linking early stress to accelerated aging, but potential mechanisms (mediators) accounting for this effect are poorly understood. Likewise, the impact of continuing stress in young adulthood on accelerated aging is largely unknown. Compounding the lack of information regarding mechanisms and timing of effects, available research is limited because it has focused mostly on White samples -- in spite of the fact that Blacks have significantly higher rates than other racial/ethnic groups of almost every type of chronic illness, as well as most markers of inflammation, and epigenetic aging (epi-A) —i.e., the difference between chronological age, and biological age, based on epigenetic changes in DNA methylation. The proposed research is designed to examine: a) factors that affect accelerated aging in Blacks, especially economic and race- related stress; and b) the role of mediators and moderators that may be useful targets for preventive interventions, such as substance use and poor diet, and also protective factors.  A focus of the current investigation is testing alternative pathways to accelerated aging attributable to early and later stressors. One pathway focuses on stressor effects on potentially unhealthy behavior (e.g., substance use, diet) that may, in turn, give rise to chronic diseases of aging. This possibility is supported by evidence that stressful life events, especially those linked to discrimination, predict life style choices. Conversely, stress effects may also accelerate aging by altering functioning of the glucocorticoid system. Or, the two pathways may be interrelated. In addition, we focus on expanding what is known about the range of stressors within a given developmental period that are most critical, and the extent to which protective factors affect epi-A. Addressing an important limitation of prior research, we will have reliable, sensitive biomarkers of smoking, marijuana, alcohol use, and diet available at two time points as well as census track and parent report indices of stressors at multiple time points, allowing and us to supplement self-report measures and examine models more rigorously and with greater precision than has previously been possible.  The proposed research will focus on 470 young adults who are part of a larger (N=889) panel study of Black families, the Family and Community Health Study. FACHS has followed a cohort of “target” participants from ages 10 to 28, along with their parents and family members. By characterizing methylation using the Illumina Epic array for two time points in young adulthood (28 and 33), we will be able to determine change in epi-A; i.e., the extent to which accelerated aging continues to be malleable in young adulthood. Using existing self- and parental reports of a variety of stressors-- from 8 waves of data, along with well-validated epigenetic biomarkers of epi-A, smoking, and drinking, we will be able to leverage the exceedingly rich existing prospective FACHS dataset, including its information on stress, protective factors, substance use, and coping, with the goal of informing preventive intervention research that can address the sources of disparities in healthy aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE As the public impact of age-related diseases has grown over time, it has become apparent that improving the quality of longer lives requires further exploration of the causes of accelerated epigenetic aging (epi-A), which forecasts heightened risk for all-cause morbidity and mortality. This proposal seeks funding to conduct new assays on existing blood samples from members of the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS), and to collect another wave of blood from these individuals, in order to assess the impact of various stressors and supports on epi-A (at age 28) and changes in epi-A from age 28 to age 33.",Contextual and Health Behavior Effects on Epigenetic Aging Among African Americans,9600256,R01CA220254,"['Acceleration ', ' Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' Censuses ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronology ', ' Communities ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Translations ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' heuristics ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' drinking ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Cytokine Gene ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' prospective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' healthy aging ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Family and Community Health Study ', ' global methylation ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' cannabis use ', ' THC use ', ' THC co-use ', ' marijuana use ', ' primary care giver ', ' primary caregiver ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' protective factors ', ' early life stress ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2018,676713,0.06349016368544029
"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) PROJECT SUMMARY—OVERALL COMPONENT: The NIH has long recognized the necessity to aggressively leverage emerging methodologies like precision medicine, digital health, biomedical data science and virtual reality & simulation based interventions approaches to ameliorate health disparities in racial and ethnic minorities. However, relatively fewer efforts have attempted to conduct trans- disciplinary aging research integrating biological, social and behavioral sciences utilizing emerging methodologies. The overarching goal of the proposed Stanford Aging and Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) is to increase the diversity of the aging research workforce by mentoring new leaders in aging research and promoting advances in behavioral and social sciences aging research using emerging methodologies including precision medicine, digital health, biomedical big data science and virtual reality and simulation based interventions. By identifying, mentoring and supporting (through dedicated pilot funds and methodological and recruitment support) junior investigators from underrepresented groups (SAGE Scientists) we propose to create a culturally sensitive and culturally competent research workforce focused on promoting equity in healthcare and mitigating disparities in diverse older populations using emerging methodologies. We have in place outstanding strengths in the three principal scientific elements requisite to form a coordinated, sustainable, and far-reaching `aging research to practice collaboration' integrating behavioral, social and biological sciences using emerging methodologies: 1) Behavioral and social scientists and disparities researchers, spanning psychology, psychiatry, demography, epidemiology, evolutionary biology, health services research & economics, computer science, social media science, virtual reality/simulation interventions and digital health; 2). Extensive experience with trans-disciplinary translational research that integrates laboratory assessment of genetic markers, their relationships to both disease risk and treatment relevance with psychosocial research approaches; and 3) Novel and outstanding analytic and high-performance `big-data' computing capabilities, consolidated in our Department of Biomedical (`Big Data') Data Science. With Stanford's setting in one of the most racially, ethnically and socially diverse aging populations in the US, and leveraging the seven-school campus-wide “Precision Health” initiative that integrates biomedical data science, engineering, business, design, digital health technology, virtual reality interventions and patient care under the recently endowed Center for Population Health Sciences we feel uniquely situated to make game-changing breakthroughs in aging research using emerging methodologies, and to lead such research efforts nationally. !

"Psychosocial Context and the Biological Clock: Changes in Weathering during Middle-Age PROJECT SUMMARY  Unprecedented growth in the proportion of older adults in the U.S. has placed inequalities in healthy aging at the forefront of the public health agenda. Individuals often differ dramatically in their speed of aging. Some demonstrate accelerated aging and suffer early onset of chronic illness whereas others manifest decelerated aging and stave off serious illness well into their 90s. In recent years, researchers have made much headway in understanding the molecular markers of healthy aging, thereby allowing for earlier identification of risk for chronic disease. The proposed research focuses on two such biomarkers of healthy aging – inflammatory aging and methylomic aging. These measures provide us with “biological clocks” that are strongly predictive of age-related physiological decline, disease, and mortality. Having established these molecular measures of the speed of aging, the important question for social scientists and health policy now becomes: To what extent is the speed of aging malleable, for better or worse, in response to natural shifts in psychosocial contexts? This question is the focus of the present proposal. We plan to investigate the extent to which adult social conditions from various domains, but especially those operating within the family, influence speed of biological aging after taking into account childhood experiences and potentially confounding life style factors such as diet, exercise, and smoking. Our objective is to identify the stressors that accelerate aging as well as the supports that decelerate aging. These goals will be pursued using longitudinal data from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS), a 20-year study of well-being among African American mothers, their romantic partners (RPs), and their offspring. A focus on aging among African Americans is important as they tend to suffer from earlier onset and higher prevalence of age-related diseases and a wider range of psychosocial stressors than other ethnic groups. First, we will obtain longitudinal indices of the speed of inflammatory and methylomic aging from the now middle-aged mothers and, if partnered, their RPs by collecting and assaying a new wave of blood data, as well as assaying stored blood from a previous wave. The proposed data will provide the first comprehensive assessment of change in the speed or rate of biological aging during adulthood. Second, we will collect an additional wave of interview data so that changes in supports and stressors can be mapped onto changes in the rate of biological aging.

"Mentoring in Patient Oriented Research on Food Insecurity, HIV and Aging Project Summary  Dr. Weiser is an internist trained in HIV epidemiology whose research program focuses on the intersection between food insecurity (FI) and health outcomes in HIV, and on interventions to reduce FI as a mechanism to improve HIV care delivery. She is a sought-after mentor and won the UCSF Academic Senate Distinction in Mentoring Award. Protected time for mentoring and for an innovative new line of research is instrumental for her to achieve her long-term career goals of becoming an international leader in patient-oriented research (POR) related to FI and HIV health, and of developing a multidisciplinary mentoring program and eventual training hub in this area. This K24 application proposes a comprehensive plan for career development, mentoring, and research, which together work towards the goal of reducing HIV health disparities, including an expansion of her research into a new direction by examining how FI affects aging outcomes in HIV. Her proposed career development plan will provide training in frailty, cognitive disorders of aging, multilevel modeling and geospatial methods, as well as in mentoring and leadership skills. She proposes a structured mentoring program including individual development plans and formal and informal teaching to help mentees reach targeted goals. She will recruit mentees from new disciplines such as geriatrics, neurology and psychology, and more mentees from underrepresented backgrounds as is critical for health disparities research. This mentoring program will help her train the next generation of researchers in FI and HIV.  To stimulate innovative POR while providing opportunities for increased, more effective mentoring, she proposes to leverage the platform of the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and expand her research into three new domains: 1) determining the impact of FI on aging outcomes including frailty and cognitive impairment; 2) understanding the mechanisms though which FI may mediate these outcomes using a novel conceptual model; and 3) investigating upstream determinants of FI using census tract data. This study is innovative in being: 1) one of the first to determine longitudinal impacts of FI on frailty and cognitive impairment and the first among HIV-infected women; 2) one of the first to assess potential mechanisms for how FI may contribute to frailty and cognitive impairment; and 3) one of the first to evaluate neighborhood-level predictors of FI using a rigorous multi-level modeling approach, and in a large sample of HIV-infected and uninfected women. To accomplish her aims and answer high impact questions at minimal cost, she will leverage data already collected in WIHS, and add measurements of FI and dietary quality for three years. She will also lead a qualitative study to understand the neighborhood- and policy-level contexts of FI and how they shape the lived experiences of health. The proposed research will help Dr. Weiser build a strong interdisciplinary network of early career investigators, provide an opportunity to address her training goals, accelerate progress towards her long- term career goals, and provide preliminary data and training opportunities for her mentees. Public Health Relevance  Food insecurity is common among poor women and HIV-infected persons, and has been associated with worse HIV and chronic disease outcomes, especially among aging populations. The proposed 5-year study aims to answer key unresolved questions, namely “What is the magnitude of the impact of food insecurity on aging outcomes in HIV?”, “Which mechanisms drive this impact?” and “What are the upstream drivers of food insecurity in an aging population?”. This research will be critical to: 1) help inform which HIV-infected persons to prioritize for new interventions; 2) select among the various programmatic options for improving food insecurity among HIV-infected women; 3) provide the best and most feasible causal evidence linking FI and aging outcomes which may garner funding to alleviate FI in this population; and 4) inform the integration of systems responding to these interlinked problems, given that funding and programs for FI, aging and HIV are largely separate. 1","Mentoring in Patient Oriented Research on Food Insecurity, HIV and Aging",9524851,K24AI134326,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Censuses ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Color ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Exercise ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neurology ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritive Value ', ' nutrient bioavailability ', ' Nutritional Biological Availability ', ' Nutritional Availability ', ' Biologic Nutritional Availability ', ' Play ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Time ', ' virology ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Internist ', ' Shapes ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' programs ', ' Nutritional status ', ' cognitive function ', ' frailty ', ' Severities ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' medical appointment ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' treatment program ', ' research study ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' cost ', ' next generation ', ' food security ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' older women ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' training opportunity ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Women’s Interagency HIV Study ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2018,188088,0.025877691281445674

"Frontiers in Alzheimer's and Aging Research (FrA2R) PROJECT SUMMARY This request, responsive to PAR-17-290, seeks to renew NIA sponsorship for our R25 award entitled “Frontiers in Alzheimer’s and Aging Research (FrA2R: R25 AG043365-05),” within NIA’s “Advancing Diversity in Aging Research through Undergraduate Education” program. Designed for competitive advanced undergraduate students, especially under-represented minorities (URMs), FrA2R provides innovative, sophisticated research education in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and aging mechanisms. To ensure that the next generation of Alzheimer’s and aging researchers have advanced training opportunities, we offer the FrA2R course at Morehouse School of Medicine (2019, 2021, 2023) and Xavier University of Louisiana (2020 and 2022). In so doing, we will continue to enhance and expand the research careers of the most promising scientists, with sensitivity to ensuring full diversity in the NIA workforce. Importantly, the ADRD and aging fields continue to grow swiftly, yet there are too few laboratories led by URM scientists and too few new URM trainees. FrA2R is under the directorship of Gerald Schatten, PhD, from Pittsburgh, along with S. Michal Jazwinski, PhD, from Tulane and Laura Niedernhofer, MD, PhD, from Scripps, as Co-Is, together with Training/Mentoring Coordinators Harris McFerrin, PhD, from Xavier, Calvin Simerly, PhD, from Pitt, and Winston Thompson, PhD, from Morehouse; together they comprise the Executive Committee. It is overseen by a scientific advisory board composed of ADRD and aging-research luminaries. FrA2R offers dynamic advanced training courses consisting of daily lectures and extended discussion on emerging concepts, followed by laboratory research and technologically intense workshops and informal seminars over week-long periods (first renewal offering May 12-18, 2019 at Morehouse). This advanced instruction provides “hands-on” training for 16 highly competitive participants (the ratio of applicant inquiries to accepted candidates is >4.3:1) on Alzheimer’s root causes and mechanisms of aging. After the course, frequent interactions are maintained with each trainee. Of the 80 trainees, 39% identify as African-American and 19% as Hispanic-American; 70% are women, and 44% are from URM institutions. Early results show that they are progressing in Alzheimer’s and aging-research careers, as MDs, MD-PhDs, or PhDs. The five aims are to: I. Provide conceptual education and laboratory training in the sophisticated methods and emerging discoveries on Alzheimer’s and aging mechanisms, especially as relevant for our African-American communities. II. Demystify the regulatory oversight requirements by training in responsible conduct of research, the ethical, legal and societal implications, and especially problems of diversity and health disparities. III. Support mentored pilot research projects; IV. Encourage trainees’ and alumni’s longer-term career planning; V. Evaluate, improve and monitor FrA2R’s strengths and avoid weaknesses with unbiased, quantitative independent mechanisms.

"Understanding the Aging Process of Urban African Americans Across the Life Course: Identifying Early Risk and Protection for Cognition and Health in Midlife PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Black Americans experience disproportionate poor aging outcomes, including pronounced disparities in brain health (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease), significant social isolation, and nearly twice the mortality rate compared to Whites. Although it is purported that these adverse health outcomes are due to a combination of greater adversity over the life course and unhealthy coping behaviors, few studies have prospectively examined these aspects of the lives of Blacks from childhood into the 60s. This developmental epidemiological study focuses on life course pathways to successful aging in a large community cohort of urban Blacks first studied at age 6, then in adolescence, and at ages 32 and 42. The proposed fifth round of data collection at age 60 is crucial for examining individual and contextual life course trajectories affecting the aging experience. The specific aims are to: (1) identify the array of aging experiences for the Woodlawn cohort of Blacks at age 60 using indicators of cognitive, physical, functional, social, and mental health, (2) determine specific stressors across the life course that influence aging, and (3) identify specific and malleable protective factors across the life course that promote physical, mental, cognitive and social well-being for urban Blacks. This comprehensive study has followed nearly all children entering first grade in 1966 in Woodlawn, a poor Chicago community (N=1242). We have collected information from mothers, teachers, and official school, criminal, and death records as well as data from cohort members themselves and now have an invaluable opportunity to examine well being comprehensively over the life course for an underinvestigated population. This one-of-a-kind study spanning more than 50 years will allow in-depth exploration of both normative development and deviance, challenging assumptions of Black homogeneity and reframing the current deficit conceptualization, to focus instead on pathways to successful aging, cognitive functioning, and health. Guided by the life course perspective and stress theory, the experienced, uniquely qualified research team will employ advanced locating technology and sophisticated analytical approaches tailored to longitudinal research. This research will contribute to understanding life course influences on aging in urban Blacks. Our long-term goal is to inform intervention development and policy making by identifying critical pivotal influences along the life course that alter aging trajectories and improve health outcomes. In addition, this study will produce a dataset that can be used by us and others for many years to identify complex patterns, subgroup differences, indirect pathways and targets for early intervention that are critical to reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes for at-risk urban Blacks. This work aligns with NIA’s strategic direction, which aims to (1) better understand the effects of personal, interpersonal, and societal factors on later life cognitive impairment (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease, Dementia) and aging, (2) understand health disparities, and (3) develop strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Black Americans experience disproportionately poorer health and higher mortality throughout the life course, disparities of great public health significance. Little is understood about factors that promote successful aging among urban Blacks. This research, which will now span over 50 years, will make unique and important contributions to our understanding of life course influences on aging, cognition, and health among Black Americans, with specific focus on multiple levels of influence, and will inform intervention development and policy by identifying life course risk factors for poor outcomes, as well as pivotal points of influence along the life course that alter risk trajectories.",Understanding the Aging Process of Urban African Americans Across the Life Course: Identifying Early Risk and Protection for Cognition

"Using a Randomized Prevention Trial to Understand the Health Benefits of Supportive Couple Relationships among Rural African American Adults PROJECT SUMMARY In this proposal, we seek to follow a well-characterized sample of 346 low-income, middle-age African American couples who recently concluded participation in a randomized prevention trial of the Protecting Strong African American Families (ProSAAF) program. All couples reside in impoverished small towns and communities in rural Georgia in which poverty rates are among the highest in the nation. Individuals in this catchment area are at elevated risk for multiple chronic diseases of aging (CDAs) including cardiovascular disease and diabetes as well as risk factors for CDAs such as inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Continuing to follow this sample with more thorough assessments of aging over the next five years will provide one of the first prospective studies of couple relationships and aging conducted within a randomized prevention trial designed for rural African American adults. As observational designs are prone to residual confounding and reverse directionality errors, the current proposal will provide a unique opportunity for testing casual hypotheses about the role of enhanced couple functioning in promoting and protecting the health of African American adults from the erosive effects of cumulative stress exposure. This proposal, therefore, is directly responsive to PA-15-042, which encourages innovative, hypothesis-driven R01 grant applications that can expand understanding of the role and impact of families and interpersonal relationships on health and well-being in midlife and older age. In this continuation then, we propose to collect two additional waves of multi-level data from couples who participated in the ProSAAF trial. This data collection will involve intravenous blood draws and other biometrics to determine whether ProSAAF participation and program-induced changes in couple functioning will carry forward to promote African Americans' healthy aging. Assessments of psychological well-being and behavioral coping strategies will be collected as well. We will test hypotheses concerning: (a) ProSAAF participation on the physical health and psychological well-being of rural African American adults; (b) mediating mechanisms through which ProSAAF- induced changes in couple relationship functioning and cumulative stress exposure influence rural African Americans' health; and (c) resilience mechanisms on healthy aging among rural African Americans. Hypotheses will be analyzed using individual- and couple-level models to examine actor, partner, and dyadic-level effects. Our proposed design provides both strong tests of theory and enhanced ability to guide practical application than typically is possible using observational research alone. Findings from this research will facilitate the development of health promotion strategies to enhance healthy aging and, ultimately, reduce health disparities among rural African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  African American adults in the rural Southeast have some of the highest rates of chronic diseases of aging, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, cancer, and dementia. These health disparities originate in part from African Americans' exposure to chronic stressors in rural Southern environments. The proposed study will investigate whether participation in a prevention program designed to enhance couple relationships, the Protecting Strong African American Families, will carry forward to promote and protect the health and well-being of rural African American adults.",Using a Randomized Prevention Trial to Understand the Health Benefits of Supportive Couple Relationships among Rural African American Adults,9522898,R01AG059260,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Family Relations ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Poverty ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Weather ', ' cytokine ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Intravenous ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' stressor ', ' Prevention program ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' antiinflammatory ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' protective effect ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' healthy aging ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Prevention trial ', ' trial design ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' racial health disparity ', ' rural African American ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2018,658377,0.10067685575278564
"An Experimental Investigation into the Impact of Socioeconomic Context on Biological Markers of Aging, Health and Mortality Poverty disproportionately impacts minority and rural populations and is very strongly correlated with poor health over the life cycle, and has been hypothesized to lead to a shorter, less healthy aging process. Poverty is associated with a greater burden of disease than smoking and obesity combined and accounts for the bulk of health disparities by race. It is widely believed that an anti-poverty policy—such as Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)—could improve healthy aging among working-age low-income adults over the life cycle. It does so by increasing material hardship and psychological stress—two risk factors that are strongly correlated with biological markers of premature aging (e.g., shorter telomeres, higher cholesterol levels, and higher blood pressure.) However, the literature linking poverty to health is largely built on correlational data, which is subject to confounding and reverse causation. The experienced research firm MDRC has secured private and public funding for a groundbreaking multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) that examines the causal impacts of quadrupling EITC for working adults without dependent children in Atlanta, GA and New York City, NY called Paycheck Plus (PP). Randomization exposes the treatment group to up to $2000 in PP compared to up to $496 in the control group. However, MDRC is not studying the impacts of PP on health. We propose leveraging MDRC’s existing infrastructure and our long history of collaboration with MDRC to add clinical, survey, and administrative measures to explore whether PP improves the health and survival of adult recipients without dependent children. Timed with launch of the study in Atlanta, we propose in-person health screenings with collection of important biomarkers of chronic disease, such as blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), blood glucose, cholesterol, and C-reactive protein (measures that are conceptually linked to poverty). For both the NYC and Atlanta Cohorts, we propose adding survey data that measures health-related quality of life and depression. Since not everybody randomized to the treatment group will file taxes (a requisite for the treated group to receive PP or the control group to receive traditional EITC), we will analyze our health outcomes using an Intent to Treat (ITT) versus Treatment on the Treated (ToT) analysis. This will produce Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) estimates of the unbiased impact of increased PP on health. In addition, we will collect long-term follow up data on mortality for both treatment sites. We will do so by linking individual identifiers administrative mortality data from the National Death Index. Finally, we will model the health and longevity gains associated with PP relative to traditional EITC. This project is innovative for exploiting a planned and fully funded social science experiment to explore outcome measures that were not originally considered by the policymakers. This project is also innovative for being a RTC of an anti-poverty program that uses administrative and clinical health data at a very low cost. We anticipate that PP will be an efficient approach to promoting healthy aging by lifting adults without dependent children out of poverty. Narrative The Columbia University team has partnered with the research firm MDRC to conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) that examines the health and survival outcomes associated with an extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for lower-income Americans without dependent children. Associational evidence suggests that EITC may have a significant impact on the health and survival over the life cycle of those who receive the credit, leading to healthy aging. However, experimental data is needed to prove this linkage.","An Experimental Investigation into the Impact of Socioeconomic Context on Biological Markers of Aging, Health and

"Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) Project Summary/Abstract The Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) is designed to increase both the number and diversity of investigators with the capacity to conduct independent research related to minority aging and health disparities. We are a research-based, mentoring partnership of four academic institutions: The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Morehouse School of Medicine, Tuskegee University, and The University of Alabama, working together to recruit minority investigators, provide education in aging and health disparities research, guide career development through collaborative mentoring, and sustain progress to successful, independent research careers. The research focus of the Deep South RCMAR is on reducing health disparities between African American (AA) and White older adults in the Deep South, the region of the country where the majority of older AAs live and health disparities have been particularly persistent. We focus on health problems particularly prevalent among older AAs in our region and for which disparities have been identified in both rural and urban settings. Our specific aims are to: (1) identify, engage, and mentor outstanding faculty under-represented in academia who are committed to academic careers in aging and health disparities research; (2) provide high quality research education and individualized career development support; (3) support innovative, high impact pilot projects that will advance the science of minority aging and health disparities; (4) provide expertise and resources for working collaboratively with communities in areas of interest to them and in the recruitment and retention of older AAs in research; (5) provide expertise and resources for study design, culturally sensitive measurement, data analysis, and access to databases for secondary analysis; and (6) disseminate to scientific, professional and lay audiences research results addressing the reduction of health disparities through the improvement of minority health, particularly for older AAs. We propose continuation and enhancements of the cores established during the first two funding cycles: the Research Education Component (formerly the Investigator Development Core), the Administrative Core, the Analysis Core, and the Community Liaison and Recruitment Core. Over the next five years, we will fund at least 15 pilot projects; provide research education through our inter-disciplinary Health Disparities Research Education Program; and assist RCMAR Scientists to obtain career development or independent research grants. With renewal of the Deep South RCMAR, we also propose innovations in each core to enhance our overall program effectiveness in recruiting minority investigators, providing education in aging and heath disparities research, guiding career development through collaborative mentoring, and sustaining their progress to successful, independent research careers. In these ways, the RCMAR will enhance the size and diversity of the scientific workforce advancing the science of minority aging and health disparities in the Deep South.

"The Longitudinal Aging Study in India DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) is a multidisciplinary, internationally harmonized panel study designed to be nationally representative of India's population aged 45 and older. LASI collects information conceptually comparable to that gathered by the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and its sister surveys in Asia, Europe, and elsewhere. LASI has brought innovations related to social connectedness, expectations, informal labor market activity, and pension participation. LASI also collects physical measures of health, including dried blood spot (DBS) specimens. Fieldwork for a four-state pilot study funded by the National Institute on Aging (1R21AG032572-01) was successfully implemented in late 2010. Building on the success of the LASI pilot survey, we will implement the first two waves of a large-scale, nationally representative panel survey on aging, health, and retirement in India, with sufficient statistical power to test hypotheses and make meaningful inferences at the national and (large) state level, and in key subpopulations. LASI will allow a better understanding of the determinants and consequences of India's population aging processes and will inform the design of appropriate evidence-based policies to address key challenges associated with population aging. Our public, internationally harmonized data will also allow for cross-national comparative studies on aging. We will field the full-scale, national LASI survey in 15 states, which together make up more than 90% of India's population. The survey instrument will be based on the pilot survey instrument, which was carefully designed to collect information compatible with other HRS-type surveys, while fully capturing key contextual characteristics of India. The target sample for LASI is non- institutionalized Indian residents aged 45 and older and their spouses (irrespective of age). We will draw 18,000 age-qualifying individuals from a stratified, multi-stage, area probability sampling design. Efforts are well unde way to raise additional, non-NIA/NIH funding to extend LASI coverage to India's smaller states and increase sample size and to thereby allow for a more extensive set of state-level inferences and cross-state comparisons. Wave 1 of LASI survey data will be collected in 2013-2014 through face-to-face interviews using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing. We will then develop and test a longitudinal survey instrument and methods that will be appropriate for follow-up waves, using the pilot sample. Based on the knowledge gained from Wave 1 and the longitudinal methods study using the pilot sample, we will implement Wave 2 in 2015- 2016. In the course of implementing Wave 2, we will seek to follow best practices from the Indonesia Family Life Study, which achieved a 6% attrition rate. Descriptive and analytic studies of the data will be performed, providing insights for scientific researchers and policy makers in India and beyond. De-identified and cleaned data will be made publicly available within one year of fieldwork completion, enabling scientists both within and outside India to use the rich LASI data. Through comparative studies, LASI will enrich scientific insights and policy development in countries besides India. In particular, LASI will provide new research opportunities in the United States and in countries that host comparable HRS-type surveys, such as China and Indonesia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) is proposed as a full-scale, national survey that will directly facilitate increased scientific investigation of the economic, social, and biological determinants and consequences of population aging in India. Internationally harmonized, de-identified panel data will be publicly available online, enabling cross-state analyses within India and cross-national comparison of the relationships among retirement, aging, and health.

"Researching Epigenetics, Weathering, Aging & Residential Disadvantage (REWARD) PROJECT SUMMARY Both African Americans living in segregated socioeconomically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods and resource-poor residents of rural areas experience high rates of premature mortality and a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other adverse health conditions. Explaining how varied experiences of material and social disadvantage become embodied and subsequently manifest in racial and geographic health disparities is the key challenge for research, policy, and practice. While persistent social disadvantage is known to shape health disparities, the biological mechanisms that underlie this process – known as weathering – remain to be elucidated. The recent discovery of differential rates of biological aging (measured using DNA methylation) across subpopulations facing early life disadvantage suggest that the epigenome may play a key role in weathering. Epigenetic markers have also been linked with known disparities in multiple chronic conditions. The Researching Epigenetics, Weathering, Aging & Residential Disadvantage (REWARD) study will advance our understanding of DNA methylation as one epigenetic mechanism linking social, economic, and geographic disadvantage with accelerated aging and phenotypes of inflammation and cardio-metabolic diseases. Our goal is to determine how different dimensions of disadvantage – including individual characteristics (e.g. racial identification, socioeconomic status, and associated experiences of discrimination), and neighborhood-level contextual characteristics (e.g. concentrated poverty, racial segregation, and rural isolation) – shape health disparities through epigenetic mechanisms. We hypothesize that early-life and cumulative personal and contextual disadvantage predict DNA methylation patterns, creating biological signatures of weathering that contribute to accelerated biological aging, inflammation, and cardiometabolic disease in vulnerable populations. Few studies possess the temporal range of follow-up, geographic diversity, and extremes in racial segregation and rural isolation needed to test the hypothesis that individual and neighborhood-level disadvantage across the life course contribute to biological signatures of adversity. REWARD fills these gaps using rich data from an ongoing population based cohort in Wisconsin -- a state known for stark disparities including urban racial segregation and rural isolation. Using the 850K Infinium EPIC Chip array, we will analyze whole blood DNA and serum from 1400 participants in the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW), an ongoing, well-characterized, population-based cohort of Wisconsin adults. The diverse team includes scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s School of Medicine and Public Health and Department of Sociology, as well as a leading biological anthropologist from Northwestern University and the UCLA-based geneticist and biostatistician who developed the Horvath epigenetic clock. The REWARD Study’s unique combination of genetic, socio-demographic, behavioral, and neighborhood-level data will allow our multidisciplinary research team to provide new insights by (Aim 1) examining differences in DNA methylation signatures across multiple domains of disadvantage; (Aim 2) investigating the epigenetic mechanisms linking accelerated biological aging with functional gene expression, inflammation, and cardio-metabolic disease; and (Aim 3) characterizing the impact of disadvantage across the life course on longitudinal changes in epigenetic markers of aging and disease. Findings from this research will highlight the variability in human biological response to adversity and inform interventions to prevent and treat age-related disease, reduce and mitigate health disparities, and improve the health of aging populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite healthcare advances, racial and geographic disparities in life expectancy and complex chronic diseases persist. The REWARD Study aims to transform our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying disparities in mortality and chronic health conditions. It focuses on characterizing patterns of DNA methylation, a key epigenetic mechanism that influences gene expression during development and throughout life in response to environmental and social conditions. Specifically, it examines whether and how exposure to personal and neighborhood-level disadvantages impact methylation patterns associated with accelerated biological aging, inflammation, and chronic cardiovascular disease outcomes. Our findings will highlight the variability in human biological responses to adversity and inform clinical and policy-level interventions to reduce and mitigate health disparities.","Researching

"USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR) Overall Project Summary Advances in medicine and technology are providing for longer and healthier lives today much more than in the past. Yet with longevity comes new public health concerns about age-related diseases and conditions. Moreover, health indicators have demonstrated little improvement in health disparities between different racial and ethnic populations over the past decades. Indeed, many of the health and economics issues associated with the aging process are of such magnitude and complexity that they cannot be understood from the vantage point of any single discipline alone. Against this backdrop, the Minority Aging Health Economics Research Center (the University of Southern California Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research, “USC RCMAR”) brings together an interdisciplinary team to provide infrastructure and resources to increase the number, diversity and success of researchers focusing on the health and economic well being of the elderly with the goal of improving the health, well-being, function, and independence of all older Americans. We will build upon its successful 5 year history, during which it has supported 15 pilots and 92 papers involving 13 scientists at USC, 1 scientist at the Spelman College, 1 scientist at Vanderbilt University and 1 scientist at Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The mission of the Minority Aging Health Economics Research Center (the University of Southern California Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research, “USC RCMAR”) is to increase the diversity and success of researchers focusing on the health and economic well being of the elderly with the goal of improving the health, well-being, function, and independence of diverse older Americans. The proposed RCMAR’s target research areas are the differences across racial and ethnic groups of elderly in health and health care usage with an emphasis is on using longitudinal survey and claims based data sources to identify causal pathways: i.e. (1) social, economic and environmental factors driving disparities in physical disease and cognitive functioning; and (2) health consequences of disparities in medical care and pharmaceutical utilization. The USC RCMAR is housed in the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, which brings together 40 health policy experts across the University—including faculty from Gerontology, Engineering, Law, Public Policy, Pharmacy, Medicine, and Arts & Letters. This proposed Center will utilize the resources of National Institute on Aging Centers including Roybal Center for Health Policy Simulation, Roybal Institute on Aging, Roybal Center for Financial Decision Making and Financial Independence in Old Age, Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Center for the Study of Health Inequality, USC/UCLA Biodemography and Population Health; and other USC Centers including Brookings Institute/Schaeffer Initiative, USC Center for Economic and Social Research, and the Schaeffer Center.

"Center for Aging in Diverse Communities: Ending Health Inequities in Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC), an NIA- funded RCMAR since 1997, conducts research, training, and mentoring in minority aging and health disparities research. CADC offers a rich, multidisciplinary environment with social, behavioral, epidemiological, cognitive neuroscience, statistical, and internal medicine faculty providing mentoring and training support. The San Francisco Bay Area provides access to a wide range of diverse racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and sexual and gender minority older adult populations. Our on-going studies with diverse rural and urban communities and solid relationships with over 100 community and clinical partners serving older adult disparity populations provide applied laboratories for mentoring. Our research theme addresses two NIA priorities: (1) understanding mechanisms of health disparities and developing effective interventions to reduce them; and (2) to develop infrastructure for high quality research. Since 1997, CADC has mentored over 90 minority underrepresented early investigators who have made significant contributions to minority aging research. In the past 5-year funding cycle, we mentored 25 minority early investigators and funded 26 pilot projects. Our cores will continue within the new RCMAR organizational framework. The Administrative Core (AC) will coordinate integration of the cores, selection of CADC Scientists, reporting, and external advisors. The Research & Education Component (REC) will provide continual mentorship and pilot study funding for CADC Scientists. The Analysis Core (AnC) will advance and disseminate methodological resources and measures for minority aging and health disparities research. The Community Liaison & Recruitment Core (CLRC) will enhance recruitment and retention and promote engagement of diverse communities in research. Our CADC cores contribute jointly and uniquely to mentoring and training CADC Scientists and others in conducting research to resolve the challenging issues facing our older adult disparity populations. CADC's aims are to: (1) select 3-4 CADC Scientists (underrepresented junior investigators) per year, provide them with pilot study funding, and mentor them to develop independent research careers in health disparities and minority aging research; (2) develop and disseminate (a) methods for conducting interventions to ameliorate disparities among older adults, (b) methods for developing/selecting measures appropriate for disparity populations, and (c) methodological resources on advanced research and statistical methods; and (3) advance the science of community engagement and recruitment to increase participation of disparity populations in research, and mentor CADC Scientists on these methods. CADC will contribute to diversifying the workforce by promoting the expertise and careers of exceptionally talented underrepresented CADC Scientists to develop independent research careers. The cumulative experience, commitment to health equity, and professional networks of CADC Faculty and Scientists in the research and local communities ensures that we will achieve these aims. NARRATIVE For 20 years, the UCSF Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) has been dedicated to eliminating health disparities in minority aging populations. Our research focuses on understanding health disparities and building and testing community-engaged interventions to reduce disparities among older adults. Our most important mission is to train and mentor talented, underrepresented junior investigators to develop independent research careers focused on health disparities and aging issues. Our mentoring is informed and optimized by our research, community partnerships, diverse local populations, and decades of mentoring experience.",Center for Aging in Diverse Communities: Ending Health Inequities in Older Adults,9776428,P30AG015272,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' California ', ' Capsicum ', ' pepper ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Laboratories ', ' Locales ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' effective intervention ', ' health equity ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' career networking ', ' speed networking ', ' professional networking ', ' career fair ', ' community building ', ' faculty community ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' community clinic ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",P30,2019,858963,0.03614622747317955
"Racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in work life: an occupational cohort study ABSTRACT For over a decade, research funded by the parent grant (R01AG026291) has made substantial contributions to our understanding of the influences of the workplace environment and other exposures accrued during work-life on health and economic trajectories in an aging population. These new findings have been possible because of the unique access to a wide variety of data sources from a single firm with plants located across the United States. Despite the impact of these findings for workplace changes that promote healthy aging and longevity, the cohort has not yet been utilized for examining racial/ethnic or rural/urban health disparities. The AMC is a study population of more than 142,000 employees at 675 facilities widely geographically distributed across the United States. Although 72% are white, there are almost 20,000 blacks and more than 10,000 Latinxs in the cohort - far greater numbers than are available in any other ongoing cohort study of an aging workforce. We will achieve three aims in this supplemental application, all of which are intended to demonstrate the utility of this cohort for answering critical questions to address racial and geographically-related health disparities. First, we will test for potential racial and ethnic bias inherent in the health risk score, a score derived by the health insurer to predict health care costs. Second, we will investigate the potential influence of factors related to place of residence on health disparities for rural workers. Finally, we will examine the extent to which job-level and work schedule-related factors contribute to racial and geographic disparities using a mediation analysis framework. This supplemental research project will allow us to extend a longstanding research program to leverage existing administrative data and new data sources to adopt a serious focus on racial/ethnic and rural/urban health disparities in the AMC population, which in turn may offer broad insights to disparities that occur throughout work life and contribute to later health and economic outcomes.

The AMC data infrastructure—including linked data from quantitative exposure measures for active workers to other behavior, social environment and health status information from pre-employment through retirement to death are fully observed—provides a unique opportunity to examine antecedents to chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, and mortality throughout the lifecourse. While 72% of the population are white, there are almost 20,000 blacks and more than 10,000 Latinxs in the cohort - far greater numbers than are available in any other ongoing cohort study of an aging workforce.

"Biodemography of Aging in Wild Chimpanzees DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While it is clear that lifespan was extended during human evolution, there is remarkably little data available to assess the specific ways by which this remarkable change in life history came about. This missing information could importantly inform the understanding of how modern lifestyles, in interaction with our evolved biology, produce the health outcomes observed in developed countries. A major limitation at present is a dearth of data on the aging process in humans' closest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee. The current study would be the first to gather comprehensive data on aging in wild chimpanzees, whose health has not been manipulated by humans during captive management or biomedical experimentation. Like humans during most of their evolutionary history, wild chimpanzees experience frequent nutritional stress and high rates of infectious disease and these processes - little studied in modern aging research - are expected to have shaped species-normative life history strategies. The project entails non-invasive collection of urine and feces from approximately 245 wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) for a broad range of health biomarkers, in additional to observational research for observed morbidity, locomotor proficiency, and social behavior. New data collection will complement and extend existing long-term demographic data, as well as individual histories of social interaction and reproductive effort. The wild data will be supplemented by additional blood-based biomarkers obtained during routine veterinary immobilizations of approximately 240 semi-free ranging chimpanzees in African sanctuaries. The project integrates investigators from major studies of health and aging in human foraging populations, and the central aim (1) of the project is to perform structured comparisons of health and aging between humans and chimpanzees. To further this goal, the additional project aims focus on key variables that are expected to shape senescence, and which are associated with prominent behavioral differences between species: (2) sex differences and the allocation of reproductive effort across the life history, (3) stability of accss to energy, and (4) social status and support. Information gathered in pursuit of these aims has specific relevance to prominent focuses of human aging research: the gender morbidity-mortality paradox, caloric restriction, and the influences of chronic stress and social subordination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern human aging and mortality patterns result from a combination of our modern lifestyle and our evolved patterns of senescence and repair. While there is excellent information on the former, very little is understood about the processes affecting the evolution of the unusual human lifespan.

"Enhancing UNderGraduate Education and Research in AGing to Eliminate Health Disparities (ENGAGED) The Enhancing UNderGraduate Education and Research in AGing to Eliminate Health Disparities (ENGAGED) program will address the clear need to increase the diversity of biomedical scientists involved in aging research and the dearth of under-represented (UR) trainees in graduate programs in the biomedical sciences, particularly in aging-related fields. Given the strengths in research on aging at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM) and in the existing didactic training in gerontology and aging-related topics at Wake Forest University (WFU) and Winston-Salem State University (WSSU), the ENGAGED Program Faculty (including Program Directors at WFSM, Co-Directors at WFU and WSSU) has vast academic and professional experiences; a history of collaborations for diversity-focused research and training programs; basic, clinical, population and translational research expertise and funding; and training program administration expertise. Thus, we are particularly well-positioned to offer training for undergraduate UR students to promote greater interest, exposure, and research experiences in the science of aging and health disparities in aging. The goals are to (1) increase awareness of the unique health care issues facing a diverse aging population and of the opportunities for research that addresses these issues and (2) expand opportunities for hands-on paid research internships at WFSM, WFU and WSSU during the academic year and during an 8-9 week summer session. These goals will be accomplished by ‘gerontologizing’ freshman seminars and introductory health science courses with lectures on topics relevant to aging; creating an ‘ENGAGED Research Club’ to foster a sense of community around the science of aging; providing a variety of educational activities, including field trips to research laboratories and geriatric clinics, real-world learning experiences in geriatric assessments and laboratory procedures, relevant workshops, seminars and journal clubs; and tracking trainee and program outcomes. Research internships will be offered under the direction of a diverse group of Research Mentors with expertise in cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes/obesity, kidney function/disease, neuroscience, and physical function, offering trainees a wide variety of research opportunities in the field of aging. A network of Research and Career Mentors will provide formal and informal resources and counseling on career paths in age-related biomedical research, particularly PhD/advanced degrees, during and after the program. Of note, ~40% of training faculty are UR minorities, and many have research expertise and/or clinical experience addressing health disparities in aging populations. In sum, the proposed ENGAGED program offers several innovative approaches to preparing UR students for a career in research in the field of aging and takes advantage of unique strengths, existing infrastructure, and long-standing collaborations among diverse faculty at WFSM, WFU, and WSSU to ensure successful creation and implementation of the program. Sustainability past NIA funding is anticipated once courses are established and successful outcomes for trainees are evident. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ENGAGED program takes advantage of the broad, multidisciplinary research established in the area of aging at Wake Forest School of Medicine and our partner institutions, Wake Forest University and Winston- Salem State University. ENGAGED will provide undergraduate students who are under-represented (UR) in the biomedical sciences an opportunity to participate in educational and research training in the field of gerontology/geriatrics, with the goal of advancing diversity in aging research and health disparities research in aging by creating a pipeline for well-trained UR students interested in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research careers.",Enhancing UNderGraduate Education and Research in AGing to Eliminate Health Disparities (ENGAGED),9792046,R25AG060912,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' geriatric screening ', ' Elderly Assessment ', ' Geriatric Assessment ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' intern ', ' Internships ', ' Laboratory Procedures ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Neurosciences ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Peer Review ', ' Productivity ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Socialization ', ' Syndrome ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' forest ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' frailty ', ' Clinic ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Physical Function ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Measurable ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Research Training ', ' Sum ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' AD prevention ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' healthy aging ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' teacher development ', ' instructor training ', ' faculty professional development ', ' faculty development ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' undergraduate education ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' student participation ', ' student motivation ', ' student engagement ', ' curriculum enhancement ', ' curriculum expansion ', ' curricular enrichment ', ' senior faculty ', ' full professor ', ' summer program ', ' summer session ', ' education research ', ' field trip ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R25,2019,335394,0.1534426096491788
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9567908,P01AG005842,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Glues ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' India ', ' Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Libraries ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Oregon ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Policy ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' Social Values ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Talents ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' information security ', ' Data awareness ', ' Data Security ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Healthcare Market ', ' Health Care Markets ', ' Services ', ' health care service organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' health care organization ', ' Performance ', ' cohesion ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' demographics ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' improved outcome ', ' opioid use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opiate use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' data access ', ' Health trends ', ' well being trends ', ' Wellness trends ', ' Wellbeing trends ', ' data resource ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' public health insurance ', ' public insurance ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2019,1747167,0.10154590091881584
"An Experimental Investigation into the Impact of Socioeconomic Context on Biological Markers of Aging, Health and Mortality Poverty disproportionately impacts minority and rural populations and is very strongly correlated with poor health over the life cycle, and has been hypothesized to lead to a shorter, less healthy aging process. Poverty is associated with a greater burden of disease than smoking and obesity combined and accounts for the bulk of health disparities by race. It is widely believed that an anti-poverty policy—such as Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)—could improve healthy aging among working-age low-income adults over the life cycle. It does so by increasing material hardship and psychological stress—two risk factors that are strongly correlated with biological markers of premature aging (e.g., shorter telomeres, higher cholesterol levels, and higher blood pressure.) However, the literature linking poverty to health is largely built on correlational data, which is subject to confounding and reverse causation. The experienced research firm MDRC has secured private and public funding for a groundbreaking multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) that examines the causal impacts of quadrupling EITC for working adults without dependent children in Atlanta, GA and New York City, NY called Paycheck Plus (PP). Randomization exposes the treatment group to up to $2000 in PP compared to up to $496 in the control group. However, MDRC is not studying the impacts of PP on health. We propose leveraging MDRC’s existing infrastructure and our long history of collaboration with MDRC to add clinical, survey, and administrative measures to explore whether PP improves the health and survival of adult recipients without dependent children. Timed with launch of the study in Atlanta, we propose in-person health screenings with collection of important biomarkers of chronic disease, such as blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), blood glucose, cholesterol, and C-reactive protein (measures that are conceptually linked to poverty). For both the NYC and Atlanta Cohorts, we propose adding survey data that measures health-related quality of life and depression. Since not everybody randomized to the treatment group will file taxes (a requisite for the treated group to receive PP or the control group to receive traditional EITC), we will analyze our health outcomes using an Intent to Treat (ITT) versus Treatment on the Treated (ToT) analysis. This will produce Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) estimates of the unbiased impact of increased PP on health. In addition, we will collect long-term follow up data on mortality for both treatment sites. We will do so by linking individual identifiers administrative mortality data from the National Death Index. Finally, we will model the health and longevity gains associated with PP relative to traditional EITC. This project is innovative for exploiting a planned and fully funded social science experiment to explore outcome measures that were not originally considered by the policymakers. This project is also innovative for being a RTC of an anti-poverty program that uses administrative and clinical health data at a very low cost. We anticipate that PP will be an efficient approach to promoting healthy aging by lifting adults without dependent children out of poverty. Narrative The Columbia University team has partnered with the research firm MDRC to conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) that examines the health and survival outcomes associated with an extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for lower-income Americans without dependent children. Associational evidence suggests that EITC may have a significant impact on the health and survival over the life cycle of those who receive the credit, leading to healthy aging. However, experimental data is needed to prove this linkage.","An Experimental Investigation into the Impact of Socioeconomic Context on Biological Markers of Aging, Health and

"Origin of Chronic Diseases of Aging Among Rural African American Young Adults PROJECT SUMMARY  The current proposal builds upon an ongoing investigation to test hypotheses about (1) the role of psychosocial stressors in “weathering” young bodies, (2) the protective factors that may mitigate their adverse impact, and (3) the role of continuity and change in weathering during a key life course transition. Tests of these hypotheses will enable a better understanding of the role of weathering in forecasting chronic diseases of aging (CDAs) among rural African Americans and set the stage for prevention programming for this vulnerable population. Using recently-developed, direct measures of biological weathering we have found that, by age 20, some SHAPE youth are already experiencing accelerated aging due to psychosocial context. The transition to adulthood provides an opportunity to examine the impact of both new and continuing sources of risk and resilience on weathering and ultimately on CDA vulnerability during this important transition period, allowing us to closely examine the potential for adverse and protective experiences to “bend” the risk curve for future CDAs and so illuminate key targets for preventive intervention. Here, we request funds to supplement the SHAPE study by using blood from an ongoing NICHD-sponsored data collection protocol to characterize each participant's “epigenetic clock” at age 26, providing a key window on weathering and changes in weathering and so allow us to conduct enhanced tests of theory and to more accurately identify high value targets for preventive intervention. By adding this assessment we will have a data set with measures of biological weathering at age 20 and age 26, along with a full complement of indicators of metabolic syndrome, a precursor to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This assessment will place no additional burden on SHAPE participants and will substantially increase the public health value of the data set. First, we will examine the impact of exposure to multidimensional SES- and race-related stressors during the transition to adulthood on changes in biological weathering. We expect exposure to stressors, particularly racial discrimination, to play a key role in maintaining or accelerating weathering processes across young adulthood and to presage CDA vulnerability (i.e. metabolic risk and inflammation). Second, we will identify positive, protective influences, both inside and outside the family, that help shift African American young adults off the above-mentioned trajectory to CDAs. We anticipate that these factors will be especially important for young adults who enter the transition to adulthood with already-accelerated weathering. The results of the proposed study will inform the development of preventive interventions designed to slow biological weathering and promote health for a population at high risk for early development of CDAs. By examining not only risk factors for accelerated aging but also protective environments and coping processes that presage a deceleration of biological aging across young adulthood, we will have the necessary ingredients for a new generation of prevention programs designed specifically to deter weathering and promote the health and well-being of rural African Americans, thereby addressing well-documented health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans coping with the challenges of rural Southern environments experience accelerated biological aging that contributes to earlier onset of chronic diseases, like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Understanding and preventing the emergence of these disparities during key transitions, like the transition to adulthood, requires attention to both change and continuity.

"South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research Undergraduate Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of South Carolina (USC) proposes to establish a South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (SC-ADAR) undergraduate program to increase the number of qualified underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students who pursue scientific graduate studies in programs focusing on science and aging. We are partnering with five Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in South Carolina (SC). The decision to focus on HBCUs was made as HBCUs have a high concentration of low-income, African American undergraduate students, many of whom are majoring in MSTEM fields, and might, through exposure to a research education program focusing on aging research, choose to enter scientific careers committed to addressing the complex biological, biomedical, behavioral, and clinical challenges that accompany aging. The proposed SC-ADAR leverages the Dual PIs' and USC's extensive experience in providing training in aging and MSTEM research for underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students across the continuum of education, from high-school through graduate school and further professional advancement. In addition, the proposed program will draw on USC's long history of collaborating with South Carolina's HBCUs in the development of educational programs for undergraduates in the STEM fields. Specific program aims include: 1) recruiting HBCU undergraduates majoring in STEM fields from five participating HBCUs in SC; 2) implementing a 24-month research education program, including: hands-on mentored research experiences in a research laboratory at USC; co-mentoring system with USC and HBCU faculty; summer coursework on aging; opportunities for joint-learning with other students; academic advising; and career/professional development activities that will assist students in applying to graduate studies in NIA MSTEM fields and professional development activities that will assist HBCU faculty mentors in career advancement in NIA MSTEM research; 3) conducting a process evaluation (to make iterative improvements in the program) and a summative evaluation to measure short-term outcomes (competencies in NIH MSTEM fields and completion of undergraduate degree in MSTEM field) and intermediate-term outcomes (application and transitioning to graduate studies/medical school); and 4) evaluating the success of the program in increasing the capacity and intention of HBCU faculty mentors to conduct research in NIA MSTEM fields. The likelihood of success is enhanced by strong institutional support from USC, USC's existing infrastructure for advancing diversity in STEM, and through the experience of the Dual PIs, with their backgrounds in research training in aging (Dr. Sue Levkoff) and the STEM (Dr. Alan White) fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed SC-ADAR institutional Research Education program seeks to address the lack of diversity among scientific experts in the aging field as well as the need for expanded basic and clinical research on health disparities among the aging population. Success in attaining the program aims will contribute to our long-term goal of attaining a diverse workforce of basic and clinical scientists to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse and older population.",South Carolina-Advancing Diversity in Aging Research Undergraduate Program,9753107,R25AG050484,"['Aging ', ' career transition ', ' career advancement ', ' Career Mobility ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Graduate Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' South Carolina ', ' Students ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' educationally disadvantaged ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' social ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', "" Bachelor's Degree "", ' Undergraduate Degree ', ' Baccalaureate Degree ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Older Population ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' public health relevance ', ' STEM field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics major ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics course ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics class ', ' science, technology, engineering and math major ', ' science, technology, engineering and math field ', ' science, technology, engineering and math discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and math course ', ' science, technology, engineering and math class ', ' STEM major ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM class ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ', ' undergraduate education ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' STEM research ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics research ', ' science, technology, engineering and math research ', ' Academic advising ', ' Educational counseling ', ' Admissions Counseling ', ' Academic guidance ', ' Academic counseling ', ' faculty mentor ', ' matriculation ', ' education research ', ' Diverse Workforce ', ' Workplace Diversity ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' minority student ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' STEM program ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics program ', ' science, technology, engineering and math program ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R25,2019,350682,0.10127148386590482
"Improving the Health of Low-SES Americans Approaching Retirement Under the Affordable Care Act PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Renuka Tipirneni, MD, MSc is a general internist and junior health services researcher focused on improving the health care system for prematurely aging low socioeconomic status (SES) adults approaching retirement age. Dr. Tipirneni's long-term career objective is to become an independent mixed methods investigator integrating large-scale clinical and economic data with in-depth qualitative data to inform the design and evaluation of policies and programs to improve the health of low-SES aging adults. Research Context: Low-SES Americans approaching retirement face a crisis of poor health and markedly increasing mortality. Between 2001 and 2014, disparities in life expectancy between low- and high-SES adults near retirement have widened and this may have accounted for 500,000 excess deaths. Yet the drivers of this crisis are poorly understood. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) should improve access to care through insurance expansions and care delivery innovations and help this group manage chronic conditions and improve their health. However, it is not clear how low-SES aging adults are specifically benefitting from ACA policies, which groups should be principally targeted for new care delivery programs encouraged under the ACA, and what factors are associated with successful health improvement and decreased costs for at-risk aging Americans. Specific Aims: 1) Determine changes in coverage, access, utilization, health and financial stress for low-SES 55-64-year-olds before and after the ACA Medicaid expansion; 2) Classify sub-groups of low-SES 55-64-year- olds at highest risk of poor health and characterize heterogeneity of changes in access, utilization, health and costs in identified high-risk sub-groups; 3) Identify facilitators of and barriers to improvements in health outcomes and health care utilization among high-risk low-SES aging adults in an ACA care delivery program. Research Plan: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Tipirneni will perform quasi-experimental analyses with the Health and Retirement Study to assess health and health care changes before and after the ACA. She will then identify sub-groups of low-SES near retirement adults at high risk of poor health trajectories. Lastly, she will conduct qualitiatve interviews with low-SES near retirement adults in an ACA care delivery program to identify facilitators of and barriers to health improvement and decreased high-cost utilization. Career Development Plan: Dr. Tipirneni will develop expertise in 1) analysis of large-scale longitudinal survey and administrative data; 2) application of quasi-experimental approaches to evaluate programs; 3) mixed methods research; and 4) programmatic research focused on aging adults. Dr. Tipirneni's career development goals will be supported by close mentorship from an interdisciplinary team; advanced didactic coursework; participation in research and career development meetings/seminars; and ongoing guidance in her research. Environment: The University of Michigan offers the ideal environment for her to pursue this training, with the outstanding guidance of well-established mentors and interdisciplinary institutes dedicated to her success. PROJECT NARRATIVE Low-income Americans approaching retirement age have been increasingly dying at alarming rates compared with higher-income Americans, yet the drivers of this crisis are poorly understood. The Affordable Care Act's new insurance options and health care delivery programs may offer strategies to help at-risk aging Americans, but it is not clear who should be targeted for such policies and programs and which elements are most helpful. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify potentially modifiable risk factors for poor health among these at-risk aging Americans in order to help design and evaluate policies and programs to improve the health of low-SES aging adults.",Improving the Health of Low-SES Americans Approaching Retirement Under the Affordable Care Act,9748329,K08AG056591,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Award ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Premature aging syndrome ', ' Premature Aging ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Internist ', ' Respondent ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Physical Function ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' cohort ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' experimental analysis ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' Medicare claim ', ' profiles in patients ', ' patient profile ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2019,167024,0.11280738603738408
"Mentoring in Patient Oriented Research on Food Insecurity, HIV and Aging Project Summary  Dr. Weiser is an internist trained in HIV epidemiology whose research program focuses on the intersection between food insecurity (FI) and health outcomes in HIV, and on interventions to reduce FI as a mechanism to improve HIV care delivery. She is a sought-after mentor and won the UCSF Academic Senate Distinction in Mentoring Award. Protected time for mentoring and for an innovative new line of research is instrumental for her to achieve her long-term career goals of becoming an international leader in patient-oriented research (POR) related to FI and HIV health, and of developing a multidisciplinary mentoring program and eventual training hub in this area. This K24 application proposes a comprehensive plan for career development, mentoring, and research, which together work towards the goal of reducing HIV health disparities, including an expansion of her research into a new direction by examining how FI affects aging outcomes in HIV. Her proposed career development plan will provide training in frailty, cognitive disorders of aging, multilevel modeling and geospatial methods, as well as in mentoring and leadership skills. She proposes a structured mentoring program including individual development plans and formal and informal teaching to help mentees reach targeted goals. She will recruit mentees from new disciplines such as geriatrics, neurology and psychology, and more mentees from underrepresented backgrounds as is critical for health disparities research. This mentoring program will help her train the next generation of researchers in FI and HIV.  To stimulate innovative POR while providing opportunities for increased, more effective mentoring, she proposes to leverage the platform of the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and expand her research into three new domains: 1) determining the impact of FI on aging outcomes including frailty and cognitive impairment; 2) understanding the mechanisms though which FI may mediate these outcomes using a novel conceptual model; and 3) investigating upstream determinants of FI using census tract data. This study is innovative in being: 1) one of the first to determine longitudinal impacts of FI on frailty and cognitive impairment and the first among HIV-infected women; 2) one of the first to assess potential mechanisms for how FI may contribute to frailty and cognitive impairment; and 3) one of the first to evaluate neighborhood-level predictors of FI using a rigorous multi-level modeling approach, and in a large sample of HIV-infected and uninfected women. To accomplish her aims and answer high impact questions at minimal cost, she will leverage data already collected in WIHS, and add measurements of FI and dietary quality for three years. She will also lead a qualitative study to understand the neighborhood- and policy-level contexts of FI and how they shape the lived experiences of health. The proposed research will help Dr. Weiser build a strong interdisciplinary network of early career investigators, provide an opportunity to address her training goals, accelerate progress towards her long- term career goals, and provide preliminary data and training opportunities for her mentees. Public Health Relevance  Food insecurity is common among poor women and HIV-infected persons, and has been associated with worse HIV and chronic disease outcomes, especially among aging populations. The proposed 5-year study aims to answer key unresolved questions, namely “What is the magnitude of the impact of food insecurity on aging outcomes in HIV?”, “Which mechanisms drive this impact?” and “What are the upstream drivers of food insecurity in an aging population?”. This research will be critical to: 1) help inform which HIV-infected persons to prioritize for new interventions; 2) select among the various programmatic options for improving food insecurity among HIV-infected women; 3) provide the best and most feasible causal evidence linking FI and aging outcomes which may garner funding to alleviate FI in this population; and 4) inform the integration of systems responding to these interlinked problems, given that funding and programs for FI, aging and HIV are largely separate. 1","Mentoring in Patient Oriented Research on Food Insecurity, HIV and Aging",9724351,K24AI134326,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Censuses ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' Color ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exercise ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) PROJECT SUMMARY—OVERALL COMPONENT: The NIH has long recognized the necessity to aggressively leverage emerging methodologies like precision medicine, digital health, biomedical data science and virtual reality & simulation based interventions approaches to ameliorate health disparities in racial and ethnic minorities. However, relatively fewer efforts have attempted to conduct trans- disciplinary aging research integrating biological, social and behavioral sciences utilizing emerging methodologies. The overarching goal of the proposed Stanford Aging and Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) is to increase the diversity of the aging research workforce by mentoring new leaders in aging research and promoting advances in behavioral and social sciences aging research using emerging methodologies including precision medicine, digital health, biomedical big data science and virtual reality and simulation based interventions. By identifying, mentoring and supporting (through dedicated pilot funds and methodological and recruitment support) junior investigators from underrepresented groups (SAGE Scientists) we propose to create a culturally sensitive and culturally competent research workforce focused on promoting equity in healthcare and mitigating disparities in diverse older populations using emerging methodologies. We have in place outstanding strengths in the three principal scientific elements requisite to form a coordinated, sustainable, and far-reaching `aging research to practice collaboration' integrating behavioral, social and biological sciences using emerging methodologies: 1) Behavioral and social scientists and disparities researchers, spanning psychology, psychiatry, demography, epidemiology, evolutionary biology, health services research & economics, computer science, social media science, virtual reality/simulation interventions and digital health; 2). Extensive experience with trans-disciplinary translational research that integrates laboratory assessment of genetic markers, their relationships to both disease risk and treatment relevance with psychosocial research approaches; and 3) Novel and outstanding analytic and high-performance `big-data' computing capabilities, consolidated in our Department of Biomedical (`Big Data') Data Science. With Stanford's setting in one of the most racially, ethnically and socially diverse aging populations in the US, and leveraging the seven-school campus-wide “Precision Health” initiative that integrates biomedical data science, engineering, business, design, digital health technology, virtual reality interventions and patient care under the recently endowed Center for Population Health Sciences we feel uniquely situated to make game-changing breakthroughs in aging research using emerging methodologies, and to lead such research efforts nationally. !

"Engagement in Longevity and Medicine (ELM) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to establish a centralized research infrastructure that harnesses New York University (NYU) Langone Health’s clinical and community partnerships throughout New York City to strengthen and advance the science of community engagement, recruitment and retention in aging and Alzheimer’s and related dementia (ADRD) research. Despite the tremendous growth in the older adult and elderly population, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities, these individuals are underrepresented in clinical research. Older age participants face challenges that differ from younger age populations in engagement, recruitment and retention in human subjects research. These include concerns about chronic disease complexities, mobility limitations, and cognitive and sensory impairments that may limit access to research opportunities or capacity to consent. As a result, the evidence of what works in healthcare interventions is less generalizable to older populations, particularly for minority and low-income communities despite the recognition of the disproportionate burden of health disparities among these communities. To address these concerns, the NYU Engagement in Longevity and Medicine (ELM) Research Collaborative will evaluate and disseminate best practices in engaging, recruiting and retaining older populations, stimulate the development and testing of innovative community-engaged and technology-based approaches to participant recruitment in clinical and community settings, and strengthen communication and messaging strategies tailored to diverse aging research populations that are inclusive of ADRD communities and representative of the National Institute on Aging’s priority populations. To increase engagement, recruitment, and retention of older age subjects into aging and ADRD research, the NYU ELM Research Collaborative will: 1) establish a centralized infrastructure including community members, clinical researchers, and patient and family stakeholders in aging and ADRD research; 2) analyze and evaluate what is currently known about successful strategies and challenges in recruitment and retention; 3) develop innovative approaches for education and engagement using electronic health record systems and community navigators rooted in the community health worker model; 4) build and deploy a novel training program for research teams using simulation with actors as potential subjects; and 5) develop a broad-based research registry of interested potential subjects reflective of the diversity of the older adult US population. This study will provide immediate benefit to ongoing aging and ADRD clinical trials and substantial support to future trials.

"Education, socioeconomic status and Aging: transitions from multimorbidity to functional limitations and mortality Project Summary Recent data suggest ongoing increases in life expectancy are accompanied by widening socioeconomic differences in life expectancy and disability. The overarching aim of this application is to understand the role of socioeconomic factors in shaping ageing outcomes, the innovation lies in the use of multi-state models (MSM) to study multiple health events that occur over the course of aging. Much of the research on aging uses time-to-event or survival analysis, where only one health outcome (chronic disease, multimorbidity, disability, or death) can be examined at a time and the inter-relationships among these outcomes are not considered. We propose to use MSM to examine the role of socioeconomic factors in transitions from a healthy state to chronic disease, to subsequent multimorbidity, to disability and death in a single analytic framework using 30-years follow-up in the Whitehall study. We identify multimorbidity due to aging of populations and poor understanding of their impact on functional impairment, disability and death critical to understanding social disparities in health at older ages. The cross-sectional nature of much of the research on multimorbidity and disability does not allow identification of prevention targets that could be used to close the gap in health status of older adults. Our approach focuses on transitions or changes in health states with ageing and examines the role of socioeconomic factors and how psychosocial, behavioral, and biological factors explain social disparities in these transitions. Our proposal is based on the Whitehall study which has pioneered research on health inequalities. We propose to examine socioeconomic disparities and underlying mechanisms in chronic diseases, transitions to multimorbidity and mortality (AIM 1), examine whether socioeconomic factors buffer the association of multimorbidity with disability, and that of disability with mortality and identify underlying mechanisms (AIM 2), and assess the role of SES in shaping the association of functional impairment (subjective and objective assessments) with mortality, and its role in terminal decline, i.e. accelerated decline in function prior to death (AIM 3). Increased life expectancy and reduced disability rates in the high socioeconomic groups suggest that it is possible to improve aging outcomes in the entire population to ensure that most older adults remain healthy, active, and independent for as long as possible. In order to do this, better understanding is needed of the pathways through which high SES promotes health and functioning at older ages; evidence that this proposal aims to generate. Project Narrative Socioeconomic disparities in health are one of the most consistent findings of epidemiologic research; ongoing increases in life expectancy are accompanied by widening socioeconomic differences in longevity and disability even in high income countries. We propose to use longitudinal data on the same set of persons followed prospectively over 30 years in the Whitehall study to identify how socioeconomic circumstances affect stages of aging and underlying mechanisms. We will examine the role of socioeconomic factors in onset of chronic disease, progression to multimorbidity, to disability, and death using multi-state models which allow analysis of all these transitions. The overarching objective is to identify stages in aging over the lifecourse and underlying risk factors which are responsible for increasing social disparities in health at older ages.","Education, socioeconomic status and Aging: transitions from multimorbidity to functional limitations and mortality",9786668,R01AG056477,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Buffers ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' cognitive function ', ' Event ', ' Country ', ' Physical Function ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' Terminal Disease ', ' terminal decline ', ' Terminal Illness ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' functional decline ', ' functional status decline ', ' decline in functional status ', ' decline in function ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,R01,2019,470243,0.03844984813942414
"Healthcare stereotype threat, health disparities, and minority aging PROJECT SUMMARY Health disparities among aging African Americans and Latinos are substantial and persistent. 1 With large segments of these populations living in poverty, healthcare access and quality are major contributors to their disproportionate burdens of disease, disability, and death. Yet, African American and Latino later life health disparities persist even in higher socioeconomic contexts. 2 This suggests that, in addition to economic barriers, there are psychosocial barriers to healthcare resource use, or utilization, and, thus, good health among aging minorities. The purpose of the proposed career development and research is to provide new understanding of later life health disparities by examining a previously overlooked psychosocial barrier to care among aging minorities, namely healthcare stereotype threat (HCST), 3-9 and how it can be ameliorated. Stereotype threat is the threat of being personally reduced to a group stereotype, 10-13 which can lead individuals to avoid stereotype-relevant domains. 10-12 For example, females have been shown to avoid STEM fields, leadership roles, and other stereotypically male domains to avoid stereotypes of inferiority and their negative social and psychological consequences. 14,15 My central hypothesis is that stereotypes regarding unhealthy lifestyles, low status, and inferior intelligence are salient for aging minorities in healthcare settings and influence healthcare resource use and health outcomes. The first of its kind, the proposed research will investigate the research questions of whether and how HCST contributes to disparities in healthcare resource use and health in aging African Americans and Latinos as compared to Whites. The approach is informed by Stereotype Threat Theory3,9,10,16,17 and my Culture and Social Identity Health Theory. 18 Specific Aims are threefold: (1) To document the association of ethnicity/race-based and age-based HCST to cross- sectional and longitudinal healthcare resource use and health outcomes among African American, Latino, and White older adults; (2) To use randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine economic and other moderators of the link between HCST and perceptions of the healthcare environment, including healthcare resource quality; and (3) To use RCT to examine how matching patients and physicians on race/ethnicity and/or age impacts the association between HCST and perceptions of healthcare resource quality. The proposed research design consists of three studies, employs a combination of survey and experimental methods, and involves both primary data collection and secondary data analysis. An assistant professor of Gerontology and Psychology at the University of Southern California, I (Candidate: Abdou) possess interdisciplinary expertise in psychology, social epidemiology, population health, and lifespan and intergenerational health disparities. This NIA K01 will provide the unique opportunity to augment my current expertise with training in health economics, health services research, and advanced training in stereotype threat and statistical and research methods (i.e., longitudinal data, RCT). Alongside my strong interdisciplinary mentorship team, I will receive the necessary support and training to work toward my long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program, including development of a successful NIH R01, to reduce later life health disparities and improve minority aging through the reduction of HCST and its sociocultural and psychobiological consequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research and training are aligned with NIA priorities, the NIH mission, and U.S. Healthy People 2020 goals to improve quantity and quality of life for all people. Expected positive impacts include the creation of stereotype-safer healthcare environments and the reduction of health disparities among aging minorities.","Healthcare stereotype threat, health

"Metabolic and Inflammatory Pathways of Midlife Neurocognitive Disparities Project Summary/Abstract Health is not randomly distributed across people or across space: it tracks a socioeconomic gradient that extends from individuals to the areas in which they live. Individual- and area-level attributes of socioeconomic disadvantage confer risk for a broad range of interrelated physical and neurocognitive health outcomes. This risk is especially apparent in midlife when pathophysiological trajectories of neurocognitive aging that predict risk for dementia in later life begin to accelerate. In this regard, we have provided some of the first evidence that individual- and area- level socioeconomic disadvantage associate with reduced cortical tissue volume and white matter integrity, aspects of brain morphology that show normative shrinkage and integrity loss with age in association with poorer cognitive outcomes. Pathways linking socioeconomic disadvantage to accelerated neurocognitive aging remain unclear. Recent evidence, including our own, suggests that metabolic factors may play a role. Individuals who develop metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for accelerated neurocognitive aging. Furthermore, our recent cross-sectional findings suggest that metabolic risk factors contribute to the associations of area-level disadvantage with brain morphology among midlife adults. Here, we aim to extend this work by longitudinally examining metabolic pathways linking individual- and area-level disadvantage to neurocognitive aging across a 10 year period of midlife. For this purpose, we propose reassessing a sample of 300 cognitively normal midlife adults on whom we collected baseline measures of socioeconomic parameters, metabolic risk, brain morphology and cognitive function 9-10 years ago (mean age at follow-up = 52). Our primary aims examine whether individual- and area-level measures of socioeconomic disadvantage predict changes in brain morphology and cognitive function that decline with age and whether associations of disadvantage with neurocognitive aging are explained by metabolic risk and associated inflammation. We anticipate that this study will contribute to new knowledge to the neurobiology of disparities in cognitive aging. Project Narrative As the US population ages, cognitive impairment is becoming a rising and intractable problem, particularly for individuals at relative socioeconomic disadvantage who are at increased risk for premature neurocognitive aging and dementia. The public health implications of the proposed research include the potential to identify modifiable risk factors that track a socioeconomic gradient and predict preclinical cognitive decline across mid-life, a period when differential trajectories of cognitive aging begin. The project focus is on metabolic risk factors that associate with disadvantage and may accelerate preclinical brain aging and cognitive decline.",Metabolic and Inflammatory Pathways of Midlife

"Contextual and Health Behavior Effects on Epigenetic Aging Among African Americans ABSTRACT: Considerable evidence exists linking early stress to accelerated aging, but potential mechanisms (mediators) accounting for this effect are poorly understood. Likewise, the impact of continuing stress in young adulthood on accelerated aging is largely unknown. Compounding the lack of information regarding mechanisms and timing of effects, available research is limited because it has focused mostly on White samples -- in spite of the fact that Blacks have significantly higher rates than other racial/ethnic groups of almost every type of chronic illness, as well as most markers of inflammation, and epigenetic aging (epi-A) —i.e., the difference between chronological age, and biological age, based on epigenetic changes in DNA methylation. The proposed research is designed to examine: a) factors that affect accelerated aging in Blacks, especially economic and race- related stress; and b) the role of mediators and moderators that may be useful targets for preventive interventions, such as substance use and poor diet, and also protective factors.  A focus of the current investigation is testing alternative pathways to accelerated aging attributable to early and later stressors. One pathway focuses on stressor effects on potentially unhealthy behavior (e.g., substance use, diet) that may, in turn, give rise to chronic diseases of aging. This possibility is supported by evidence that stressful life events, especially those linked to discrimination, predict life style choices. Conversely, stress effects may also accelerate aging by altering functioning of the glucocorticoid system. Or, the two pathways may be interrelated. In addition, we focus on expanding what is known about the range of stressors within a given developmental period that are most critical, and the extent to which protective factors affect epi-A. Addressing an important limitation of prior research, we will have reliable, sensitive biomarkers of smoking, marijuana, alcohol use, and diet available at two time points as well as census track and parent report indices of stressors at multiple time points, allowing and us to supplement self-report measures and examine models more rigorously and with greater precision than has previously been possible.  The proposed research will focus on 470 young adults who are part of a larger (N=889) panel study of Black families, the Family and Community Health Study. FACHS has followed a cohort of “target” participants from ages 10 to 28, along with their parents and family members. By characterizing methylation using the Illumina Epic array for two time points in young adulthood (28 and 33), we will be able to determine change in epi-A; i.e., the extent to which accelerated aging continues to be malleable in young adulthood. Using existing self- and parental reports of a variety of stressors-- from 8 waves of data, along with well-validated epigenetic biomarkers of epi-A, smoking, and drinking, we will be able to leverage the exceedingly rich existing prospective FACHS dataset, including its information on stress, protective factors, substance use, and coping, with the goal of informing preventive intervention research that can address the sources of disparities in healthy aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE As the public impact of age-related diseases has grown over time, it has become apparent that improving the quality of longer lives requires further exploration of the causes of accelerated epigenetic aging (epi-A), which forecasts heightened risk for all-cause morbidity and mortality. This proposal seeks funding to conduct new assays on existing blood samples from members of the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS), and to collect another wave of blood from these individuals, in order to assess the impact of various stressors and supports on epi-A (at age 28) and changes in epi-A from age 28 to age 33.",Contextual and Health Behavior Effects on Epigenetic Aging Among African Americans,9754796,R01CA220254,"['Acceleration ', ' Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' Censuses ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronology ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Translations ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' heuristics ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' drinking ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Cytokine Gene ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' prospective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' healthy aging ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Family and Community Health Study ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' global methylation ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' marijuana use ', ' cannabis use ', ' THC use ', ' THC co-use ', ' primary caregiver ', ' primary care giver ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' protective factors ', ' early life stress ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2019,634485,0.06349016368544029

In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Tim Strauman, Keith Whitfield, and Toni Antonucci) he has developed a comprehensive training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on the interrelationships between multiple measures of psychosocial and neurocognitive factors associated with accelerated cognitive aging, and serve as bridge for him to establish an independent investigator career in conducting biobehavioral health disparities research in aging adult male populations. To accomplish this goal, he proposes four career development activities and three research aims that combines instruction with established scholars in survey research techniques; formal coursework; participation in ongoing seminars at Duke University; one-to-one directed readings with mentors; and finally, conduction of a “proof of concept study” from start to finish. Preliminary data will be collected with using a mixed-method design that consists of a survey, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by creating a more robust overall portrait of psychosocial protective and risk factors that may impact the long-term consequences of mTBI among men than previously possible. The approach used in this project will address; a) male vulnerabilities in predicting the impact of psychosocial factors on accelerated cognitive aging and b) how understandings of masculinity develop across and within groups in relationship to pain, injury, and brain health. This project will continue to build on insights he has gained through his examination of data from the Study of Retired NFL Players. By completing these aims, he will test important hypotheses and make a substantial contribution to the evidence base by describing the process of cognitive accelerated aging resulting from mTBI. This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore innovative approaches to address functional, cognitive, and psychosocial vulnerabilities in concussed men, and may ultimately reduce the risk of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Alzheimer's disease resulting from concussions. It will also inform an R-series grant proposal to study accelerated cognitive aging and brain imaging that Dr. Turner plans to submit in year 4 of the project. Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is a common, costly, and potentially preventable condition in the United States. Despite heightened awareness as a result of national public health campaigns and increased visibility in the media, many individuals continue to be at risk of life- long and sometime debilitating effects of brain injury. The goal of this project is to explore innovative approaches to address functional, cognitive, and psychosocial vulnerabilities in concussed men, which may ultimately reduce the risk of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Alzheimer's disease resulting from concussions.",An Analysis of Psychosocial Risk and Protective Factors: Accelerated Cognitive Aging and Mild Traumatic Brain

"Clin-STAR Coordinating Center Project Summary The US continues to suffer a critical shortage of well-trained clinicians to address the needs of a growing aging population. Historically, non-geriatricians have not focused on the needs of older adults. Hence, clinicians in other specialties must be trained and encouraged to focus their practice and research on the age-related aspects of their discipline. Although important progress has been made through initiatives that integrate geriatrics and aging research into the medical, surgical and other clinical disciplines, further significant commitment is needed to train the future leaders in aging research. This U24 proposal seeks to accelerate these efforts by building a robust, multi-faceted and highly-networked national platform that will organize activities and provide resources for the cultivation, connection, and synergy of clinician-scientists in aging research from disparate disciplines across the US. This objective will be achieved through a set of four specific aims: 1) to develop an organizational structure that will facilitate the exchange and dissemination of scientific and research knowledge on aging and the care of older persons; 2) to provide mentoring and career development support for emerging investigators committed to pursuing aging research in their clinical discipline; 3) to stimulate aging research, foster networking and collaborations across disciplines, and identify and support high priority and understudied areas of aging research; 4) to develop and implement strategies for assessing the effectiveness of the Clin-STAR program and to use this information to guide future directions and report outcomes to stakeholders. The Clin-STAR Coordinating Center will accomplish these aims through a broad array of strategic initiatives, including: developing a Clin-STAR website, social media presence, and database that connects Clin-STAR investigators; organizing webinars, annual meetings and content-focused transdisciplinary interest groups; identifying and partnering with other relevant networks; providing mentorship and professional development resources; and supporting pilot grants, mini-sabbaticals and visiting professorships. The Clin-STAR Coordinating Center will leverage the accumulated research, career develop- ment, and mentoring expertise of over 20 clinician investigators (4 PIs, 10 co-investigators, and 8 advisory board members) across 20 institutions, in partnership with the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR), which will serve as the National Program Office for the proposed activities. Innovative features include an organizational structure that includes 3 prominent academic resource centers that will support core- specific activities; leveraging the community of Beeson Scholars and NIA K24 recipients; an annual meeting that will abut the highly successful Beeson Annual Meeting; creation of an Outreach Fund that will support an array of opportunities to build leadership skills, support career development, raise the visibility of aging research, and promote the Clin-STAR Program; a novel evaluative approach based on network science; and efforts to establish a public-private partnership through philanthropy and leveraging existing relationships. Project Narrative Substantial human capital investments by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and private partners have led to a growing number of clinician-scientists in aging research from a diverse array of specialties and disciplines. The pipeline of early-stage and established investigators would benefit greatly from a national platform that will convey scientific and research knowledge, foster networking and collaboration, provide mentoring and career development support, and advance transdisciplinary research. The overall objective of the Clin-STAR Coordinating Center is to establish a robust, multi-faceted and highly-networked national platform that will organize activities and provide resources for the cultivation, connection, and synergy of clinician-scientists in aging research from disparate specialties across the US.",Clin-STAR Coordinating Center,9861435,U24AG065204,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Communities ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Gills ', ' Grant ', ' Interest Group ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Privatization ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Caring ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' synergism ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Committee Members ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' Address ', ' Resource Development ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' sex ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' human capital ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' public-private partnership ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' Geroscience ', ' sabbatical ', ' social media ', ' webinar ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Infrastructure ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,AMERICAN FEDERATION FOR AGING RESEARCH,U24,2019,918803,0.1587191319460984
"Advancing aging research through development of minority gerontologists DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of establishing the Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR) program at Howard University (HUADAR) is to identify a group of bright minority students from MSTEM disciplines early during their undergraduate years and then through extensive mentoring and training prepare them to successfully compete for graduate studies and other professional careers. By making them familiar with aging research early in their career, this cadre of minority researchers could be made squarely interested about building a career on geriatrics and gerontology. The Rationales for developing an HUADAR program is quite justifiable, for more than a century Howard University is engaged in training underrepresented minority students. About 97% of Howard's mentees are African Americans and National Science Foundation's (NSF) recent ranking put Howard University as the top producer of bachelor's degree recipients who subsequently earned science and engineering doctoral degrees nationally from top-tier research universities. Moreover, with an aggressive recruitment effort, Howard University successfully recruited several faculty members in MSTEM areas who are maintaining an active research programs on various aspects of aging and age related disorders. Therefore, Howard University has the ideal environment to identify a cadre of talented minority scientists early during their undergraduate years and it has the required resources to provide them with a foundation of knowledge and research skills through mentoring so that these students will excel in the interdisciplinary field of gerontology. Trainee compositio for HUADAR program will include 100% underrepresented minorities. Approximately 7,000 undergraduate students enroll at Howard in 29 undergraduate departments and programs, approximately 97% of enrollees are African American and 67% are women. Furthermore, 20% (or 1,400) major in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering and Allied Health with greater than 80% declaring medicine as their career goal. We plan to recruit five students from MSTEM disciplines each year by selecting them early at the end of their freshman year using a recruitment strategy which includes: a) identification of strong performing students in the introductory courses, b) students enrolled in the Honors Program, c) recommendations by faculty members, and d) students responding to advertisements, announcements, and oral presentations. Proposed training is a comprehensive research education plan designed for HUADAR trainees which consists of following components: (1) develop two new courses on aging, (2) exposure to aging research in various laboratories at Howard during sophomore and junior years, (3) attending research seminars by prominent gerontologists, (4) a summer research apprenticeship opportunity outside Howard University in leading research institutes on aging like NIA Baltimore, UT Health Sciences Center, Johns Hopkins, Georgetown University Medical Centers, University of Maryland and University of Washington, (5) writing a honors thesis/senior thesis during senior year, (6) provide one on one mentoring to build a successful career path. Thus, from their sophomore year up to the senior year we have a carefully laid out plans to educate the HUADAR trainees on different aspects of aging research including the social aspects of aging. All students and personnel will be required to participate in instruction on the Responsible Conduct of Research. Evaluation plan for HUADAR will consist of course evaluations, student performances, faculty efficacy surveys, summer research experience surveys, successful completion of an honors thesis/senior thesis. The long-term goal of HUADAR program is to prepare minority students as future researchers through scientific training and educational experiences and we will encourage them to seek aging research as a career goal. Thus we will embrace the goal of NIA ADAR initiative to ""fill a gap in the pipeline transitioning from undergraduate to graduate education in aging as it relates to medicine, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to fulfill the objectives of the NIA Health Disparities Strategic Plan"". PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By 2030 we will be living in an America with 1 in 5 American 65 years or older. The ethnic minority portion of our population is growing at an amazing pace from 4.3 million persons in 1990 to 22.5 million expected by the year 2050. This nation needs to be prepared to deal with ethnically diverse minority elderlies who will account for more than 15% of older persons by 2020 and more than 21% of older persons by 2050. Since health disparity among the ethnically diverse minority population is real and we have to deal with it immediately. Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR) is an attempt to identify a cadre of minority scientists early during their undergraduate years, provide them with a foundation of knowledge and research skills through mentoring so these students will excel in the interdisciplinary field o gerontology. With this conviction, this proposal lay out a detail research education plan to establish an ADAR program at Howard University called HUADAR. In the long term HUADAR trainees will create culturally sensitive health measures to assess the health status of minority elders with greater precision.",Advancing aging research through development of minority gerontologists,9606370,R25AG047843,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Baltimore ', ' Biology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Chemistry ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Graduate Education ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Maryland ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Physics ', ' Physiology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Talents ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Amaze ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Oral ', ' Physical Function ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Social status ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' education planning ', ' Advertisements ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' degenerative disease ', ' degenerative condition ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Length ', "" Bachelor's Degree "", ' Undergraduate Degree ', ' Baccalaureate Degree ', "" Doctor's Degree "", ' doctoral degree ', ' Doctorate Degree ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' minority health ', ' Instruction ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' convict ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' public health relevance ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate research ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' apprenticeship ', ' apprentice ', ' summer research ', ' education research ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' minority scientist ', ' minority student ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,R25,2019,364619,0.13044233842832803
"Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) Project Summary/Abstract The Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) is designed to increase both the number and diversity of investigators with the capacity to conduct independent research related to minority aging and health disparities. We are a research-based, mentoring partnership of four academic institutions: The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Morehouse School of Medicine, Tuskegee University, and The University of Alabama, working together to recruit minority investigators, provide education in aging and health disparities research, guide career development through collaborative mentoring, and sustain progress to successful, independent research careers. The research focus of the Deep South RCMAR is on reducing health disparities between African American (AA) and White older adults in the Deep South, the region of the country where the majority of older AAs live and health disparities have been particularly persistent. We focus on health problems particularly prevalent among older AAs in our region and for which disparities have been identified in both rural and urban settings. Our specific aims are to: (1) identify, engage, and mentor outstanding faculty under-represented in academia who are committed to academic careers in aging and health disparities research; (2) provide high quality research education and individualized career development support; (3) support innovative, high impact pilot projects that will advance the science of minority aging and health disparities; (4) provide expertise and resources for working collaboratively with communities in areas of interest to them and in the recruitment and retention of older AAs in research; (5) provide expertise and resources for study design, culturally sensitive measurement, data analysis, and access to databases for secondary analysis; and (6) disseminate to scientific, professional and lay audiences research results addressing the reduction of health disparities through the improvement of minority health, particularly for older AAs. We propose continuation and enhancements of the cores established during the first two funding cycles: the Research Education Component (formerly the Investigator Development Core), the Administrative Core, the Analysis Core, and the Community Liaison and Recruitment Core. Over the next five years, we will fund at least 15 pilot projects; provide research education through our inter-disciplinary Health Disparities Research Education Program; and assist RCMAR Scientists to obtain career development or independent research grants. With renewal of the Deep South RCMAR, we also propose innovations in each core to enhance our overall program effectiveness in recruiting minority investigators, providing education in aging and heath disparities research, guiding career development through collaborative mentoring, and sustaining their progress to successful, independent research careers. In these ways, the RCMAR will enhance the size and diversity of the scientific workforce advancing the science of minority aging and health disparities in the Deep South. NARRATIVE The Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) is designed to enhance the size and diversity of the scientific workforce advancing the fields of minority aging and health disparities.

"A new vertebrate model to study the role of growth factors IGF1 and IGF2 in sex dimorphism of longevity and aging. Women live longer than men, and different age-related diseases afflict women and men at different rates. Our poor understanding of the basis of these sex-differences promote disparities between men and women in the success of treatments of age-related diseases. The Insulin and Insulin-like Signaling (IIS) molecular pathway is known to regulate longevity. The overall goal of the proposed research program is to test if hormones that regulate the IIS pathway contribute to sexual dimorphism in longevity and aging. Research on one of these hormones, IGF2, has been limited by the lack of an animal model that naturally expresses IGF2 in adulthood. To overcome this barrier, this research will use a novel model system, the brown anole lizard, which naturally expresses IGF2 through adulthood similarly to humans, to address questions on the role of IGF2 in aging. This proposal has two Specific Aims that include experiments both in a brown anole laboratory colony and in a lizard cell culture system. Specific Aim 1 uses a longitudinal experiment at the organismal level to define the respective roles of IGF1 and IGF2 in sexual dimorphism of aging and longevity. Specific Aim 2 uses cell culture experiments to test whether the male cellular environment is pro-aging, and if sex differences in IIS signaling become programmed with age. This contribution will be significant because it will remove a blind spot in our knowledge on the function of the somatotropic axis on the sex-specific biology of aging by developing and using an alternative terrestrial vertebrate model and comparative approaches that are synergistic with established models. Furthermore, the integration of research and undergraduate education with this project is designed to provide extensive hands-on research experience related to the biology of aging for 50+ undergraduate researchers annually. The proposed research and developed methodology will open new avenues of research, currently unattainable with our standard model systems, on IGF2 and other top regulators of the IIS pathway that play a role in the natural processes of aging. Women live longer than men, and different age-related diseases afflict women and men. This project is aimed at understanding how specific hormones regulate the aging process within the cell and the organism. We hope to better define the processes of how males and females age differently so that treatments and therapies can be designed to be more effective within a sex, and promote healthy aging across both sexes.",A new vertebrate model to study the role of growth factors IGF1 and IGF2 in sex dimorphism of longevity and aging.,9813428,R15AG064655,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Animals ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' Laboratories ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Lizards ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methodology ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' mortality ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Play ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Gonosomes ', ' Sex Chromosomes ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Societies ', ' somatotropic hormone ', ' Pituitary Growth Hormone ', ' Growth Hormone 1 ', ' Growth Hormone ', ' Somatotropin ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Telomerase ', ' Organ ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Exposure to ', ' Retinal blind spot ', ' Blind Spots ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Hormonal ', ' experience ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' success ', ' sexual dimorphism ', ' sexually dimorphic ', ' sex dimorphism ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' embryo tissue ', ' Embryonic Tissue ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' IGF1 gene ', ' IGFI ', ' IGF1 ', ' IGF2 gene ', ' IGF2 ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' in vivo ', ' mTOR Signaling Pathway ', ' Cell Culture System ', ' Comparative Biology ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' human male ', ' comparative ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' healthy aging ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' undergraduate education ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Standard Model ', ' hands on research ', ' Growth Factor ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Growth Agents ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' hormonal signals ', ' hormone signals ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIA,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,R15,2019,448345,0.08585406908563234

A diverse healthcare workforce is important to expand healthcare access for underserved populations and to enrich the pool of leaders and policymakers with unique insights into and familiarity with the diverse healthcare needs of our aging population. This is especially true for clinical research, since researchers often rely on personal experience as they formulate and seek to answer research questions. Thus, broader representation of underrepresented minority leaders in the clinical research workforce can help ensure that research priorities appropriately address the needs of older minority groups.  Despite the recognized need for a diverse clinical research workforce, students from underrepresented groups face significant barriers to pursuing training in clinical research for older adults. Students from underrepresented groups encounter financial, informational and cultural challenges that limit their interest and participation in medicine overall. Moreover, students from underrepresented groups may be less likely to pursue training in clinical research for older adults if they do not perceive such research as relevant to their lives.  The University of Chicago (UC) is a leader in training future clinical researchers from underrepresented backgrounds, with a specific focus on aging through several NIA research training programs designed for students at different training levels. These training programs expose students to formal didactic curricula in aging and clinical research, multi-tiered mentorship teams that conduct clinical research in aging, and realistic career experiences in clinical research and aging. Our NIGMS-funded pipeline program for underrepresented Chicago public high school students has successfully increased the interest and intent in pursuing a career clinical research. Our NIA programs for medical students have successfully improved interest in aging research careers and research productivity of those trainees (i.e., publications and awards).  Building on the success of our programs for diverse high school and medical students, we will leverage our experience training learners in aging research to build the Cultivating Health & Aging Researchers by Integrating Science, Medicine & Aging (CHARISMA) program, a structured longitudinal multi-tiered mentored aging-related research training program for undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds. The objectives of CHARISMA are 1) to prepare undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds for medicine, science, engineering, technology and mathematics (MSTEM) careers in aging-related clinical research, and 2) to increase and sustain learner satisfaction, aging-related research knowledge, attitudes toward aging-related clinical research careers, and behaviors associated with pursuing an aging-related research career in an MSTEM field among underrepresented undergraduates. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Cultivating Health & Aging Researchers by Integrating Science, Medicine & Aging (CHARISMA) program is a structured longitudinal multi-tiered mentored aging-related research training program for undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds. CHARISMA aims to train underrepresented undergraduate students for an MSTEM career in aging-related clinical research through: 1) a didactic curriculum structured to generate interest in and the provision of knowledge necessary to pursue an MSTEM career in aging-related research, 2) exposure to a multi-tiered structure of mentorship that enables identification of multi-level aging-related clinical research role models that can facilitate career choice, 3) participation in realistic career activities that actively challenge and engage students to develop attitudes and behaviors relevant for aging-related clinical research.","Cultivating Health & Aging Researchers by Integrating Science, Medicine & Aging",9633782,R25AG060910,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Encounter Groups ', ' Engineering ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Health ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' Productivity ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' satisfaction ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Familiarity ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' NIGMS ', ' Research Training ', ' Older Population ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Curriculum Management System ', ' interactive curriculum ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' didactic education ', ' didactic curriculum ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' faculty mentor ', ' matriculation ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R25,2019,361205,0.07629913236265398
"English Longitudinal Study of Ageing: renewal 2014 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for competitive funding of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for the period 2014 - 2020. ELSA started in 2002 as a sister study to the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), and recruited 12,100 men and women aged 50 and above who were representative of the older population of England. ELSA has been part-funded by NIA since it began, with half of the funding coming from a consortium of UK Government Departments. This renewal request is to fund three waves of data collection - waves 7 (2014/15), 8 (2016/17), and 9 (2018/19) - and associated analyses. The central objective is to provide the high quality data necessary for an exploration of the dynamic relationships between health and functioning, economic position, social participation, wellbeing, cognitive function and health as people plan for, move into and progress beyond retirement. ELSA is a multidisciplinary study, involving the collection of economic, epidemiological, health, social, psychological, physiological and genetic data. The phase of data collection planned in this application will greatly increase the potential for longitudinal analyses so as to examine causal process.  The research agenda of this application is focused on the following broad issues that are important scientifically while also being relevant to policy: comparisons of trajectories of health and wellbeing in England, the USA, and other countries; the determinants of economic wellbeing in older age; the nature and timing of retirement and post-retirement labor market activity; the interaction between psychosocial, genetic, and biological determinants of health and mortality; cognitive functioning and its impact on decision making among older people; disability and the compression of morbidity; the implications of mild cognitive impairment for social, economic and subjective wellbeing; economic, social and health inequalities in an ageing population; social participation and social productivity at older ages; intergenerational relationships and generativity; and health care utilization and transitions to social care.  The specific objectives of the new proposal are to: 1.

"Relationships between mental health and biomarkers of stress and sleep in Latinas Summary: The overall goal of this diversity supplement to the NIA RCMAR P30 UCSF Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) parent grant is to provide Dr. Cathy Samayoa, a Latina molecular biologist, with training in behavioral research methods to study aging and aging-related diseases, career development, and mentorship to support her transition into an independent research career focusing on biobehavioral mechanisms underlying health disparities in aging. These goals directly align with the aims of the parent P30 award and with NIA's overall mission to investigate factors impacting aging across the life course. This proposal's research goal is to investigate relationships between mental health (stress, depression) and biological markers of stress and sleep (cortisol awakening response [CAR], melatonin) to gain insight into mechanisms that contribute to accelerated biological weathering (excess biological wear and tear) and to health disparities among Latina breast cancer survivors. CAR is a measure of stress reactivity while melatonin is a sleep-related biomarker. Emerging evidence suggests these measures are contributors to health disparities for various health conditions and age-associated diseases. Even so, we lack knowledge of the impacts of these factors on one another. We propose to leverage our existing data set, collected for our Nuevo Amanecer study of rural Latina breast cancer survivors, to investigate the longitudinal and simultaneous reciprocal relationships between CAR, melatonin, and self-reported measures of mental health within this health disparity population. By investigating directional pathways and their relative strengths, we can identify and potentially target early points of intervention. The research experiences and career development activities have been carefully planned to serve as a cohesive whole to foster Dr. Samayoa's development into a multidisciplinary investigator with a biobehavioral focus. These include coursework and directed readings on aging, behavioral science methods, measurement, and statistical modeling; strengthening her publication record; participation in monthly CADC meetings; and attendance at national meetings and workshops. Finally, in year two, she will develop a K-award proposal that will further investigate how behavioral and social factors impact biological mechanisms involved in aging and health disparities among minorities.

"Interdisciplinary Network on Rural Population Health and Aging Project Summary U.S. population aging is occurring more rapidly in rural than in urban areas, rural areas are home to disproportionate shares of older and sicker people, and rural-urban and within-rural disparities in health and mortality are growing. New approaches to researching rural health and aging are needed that recognize that rural America is not monolithic, it contains both resilient and vulnerable places, and its problems are multilevel and multidimensional. The Interdisciplinary Network on Rural Population Health and Aging (INRPHA) will forge new collaborations between scientists who study health and aging with others who focus on spatial disparities and rural well-being. We will bring together dynamic clusters of scientists and recruit emerging, established, and underrepresented researchers from multiple institutions across the U.S. to catalyze a new generation of research on rural U.S. population health and aging. We will leverage a well-established USDA-supported national consortium of researchers (W4001) that has been at the forefront of providing timely and policy-relevant evidence on demographic trends in rural America. In addition, health and aging researchers and the institutional assets within the proposed Network’s four lead universities – Penn State, Syracuse Univ., Univ. of Mississippi, and Univ. of Colorado, Boulder – constitute a pool of expertise poised to provide novel, interdisciplinary, and regionally- attuned understandings of social and spatial determinants of rural population health, health disparities, and aging. The project’s aims are to (1) develop an open and evolving network that draws participants from multiple regions, institutions, disciplines, career stages, and underrepresented groups; (2) design activities to generate innovative research by enhancing the collective capacity of Network members and supporting formative research through pilot grants, working groups, annual meetings, and training materials; and (3) conduct novel research to: a) understand the multilevel and multidimensional mechanisms driving rural-urban continuum and within-rural disparities in health and aging, b) detail the impacts of aging trends on rural communities, c) analyze the intersection of rural economic livelihoods, health, and aging, d) examine the impacts of physical and social isolation on cognitive health (including Alzheimer’s disease) and healthy aging in rural areas, and e) understand relationships between environmental hazards and climate change for rural older adults. We will also attend to intersections between race, rurality, and health and aging outcomes and how these relationships vary across regional, state, and local contexts. A final aim is to (4) disseminate data, analytic resources, and research findings to academic, policy, and public audiences through research briefs, webinars, data archiving, and other mechanisms. Through INRPHA’s activities, emphasis is placed on developing a sustainable foundation to support continued innovative, publicly-accessible, and impactful research on rural population health and aging.

"Linking 1940 U.S. Census Data to Five Modern Surveys of Health and Aging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will link records from the 1940 U.S. Census to records for respondents to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS); the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID); the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS); the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP); and the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). These ongoing longitudinal studies are the cornerstones of America's data infrastructure for interdisciplinary research on aging and the life course; physical and mental health, disability, and well-being; later-life work, economic well-being, and retirement; and end-of-life issues. A crucial limitation of these studies is that they contain little information about social, economic, family, neighborhood, and environmental circumstances in childhood and young adulthood. The sparse early-life information that is now available is usually collected retrospectively in later adulthood; the quality of these few retrospective reports is largely unknown. This serious limitation of these data hinders researchers' ability to study the long-term impacts of childhood and young adult circumstances and to understand how later-life outcomes are the result of cumulative life-course processes. Linking these studies to the 1940 U.S. Census will produce data infrastructure that vastly expands their analytic utility for a variety of substantive problem. This project involves (1) preparing and formatting data files containing respondents' identifying information; (2) deploying sophisticated machine linking algorithms to link the project records to the 1940 U.S. Census; (3) hand linking records that cannot be machine linked and hand-verifying a portion of those that can; (6) creating individual-, family-, and contextual/spatial-leel variables that are consistent with IPUMS and comparable across projects; (7) documenting the new measures and making them available as part of projects' restricted access dissemination systems in a manner consistent with respondents' privacy rights; (8) publicizing the resulting measures and conducting user outreach to maximize the utility and visibility of the new data resource; and (9) conducting methodological analyses to assess the validity of retrospective reports of childhood social and economic circumstances. The project will be led by a team from the Minnesota Population Center in collaboration with each projects' leadership team. The researchers have considerable expertise in the construction and analysis of longitudinal studies of health and aging and in historical record linkage using machine and hand linking techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will substantially improve basic infrastructure for demographic, social scientific, and public health research on aging, retirement, health, mortality, economic circumstances, and well-being in later adulthood; it will transform our ability to understand the long-term impact of social, economic, genetic, demographic, neighborhood, contextual, and environmental circumstances and exposures in early life on any of the later-life outcomes observed in America's most important studies of health, aging, and retirement. The proposed work is directly relevant to the central mission of the NIH as the steward of medical and behavioral research for the nation: the resulting data will advance fundamental knowledge about population health and population dynamics and will spawn a new generation of research across disciplines.",Linking 1940 U.S. Census Data to Five Modern Surveys of Health and Aging,9617636,R01AG050300,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Coal ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Hand ', ' Household Heads ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Industry ', ' Labor Forces ', ' Leadership ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Marital Status ', ' Marriage ', ' age at marriage ', ' Marriage Ages ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methodology ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mission ', ' Modernization ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Names ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Parents ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Birth Place ', ' Play ', ' Population Density ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Power Plants ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retirement ', ' Rights ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' School Enrollments ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Tongue ', ' Veterans ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Privacy ', ' Family member ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Discipline ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Data Files ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Inequality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' grandparent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' health record ', ' Agreement ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Institution ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Data ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' data format ', ' public health research ', ' population health ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' data resource ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,536963,0.10694019790079831
"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9691090,R01AG057704,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death Certificates ', ' Demography ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Hand ', ' Handwriting ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Marriage ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sanitation ', ' Science ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Toxin ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccines ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Inequality ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' health knowledge ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Maiden Name ', ' Maiden ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' suicide rate ', ' cost ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' population health ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' data resource ', ' early-life nutrition ', ' Infrastructure ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,308553,0.15595127043171572

"Enhancing Leadership Capacity to Mentor Scientists in Translational Behavioral AD-Related Research Project Summary Community-engaged research, focusing on patient-centered outcomes (PCO), is critical in translating scientific evidence into health benefits for the aging US population. There’s limited focus on understanding associations of sleep with brain health and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among older adults, particularly minorities who are disproportionately burdened by Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Consistent with the NIH roadmap of translating research into practice, it is paramount that health professionals be trained to pursue careers in PCO that promote healthy aging. The K07 leadership award will serve as (a) a collaborative learning laboratory and (b) a resource to stimulate, support, and evaluate high-priority translational aging research in diverse communities. It will coalesce a network of renowned investigators to tackle adverse sleep-related CVD outcomes in a diverse aging population. It will also address a critical deficiency in the academic workforce by mentoring junior scientists to pursue careers in translational behavioral research and to become effective mentors. The plan builds upon Dr. Jean-Louis’ leadership in implementing community research and mentoring programs. Its strong likelihood of success is anchored by his outstanding experience engaging multiple stakeholders supporting aging-related research initiatives. The K07 plan will be implemented in an outstanding academic environment for translational behavioral research. It leverages several NYU resources, particularly those of the CTSI, the Center for Healthful Behavior Change, the Center for Brain Health, and the Sleep Disorders Center. Other enhancements to this environment include: 1) a community-academic partnership with a shared aging research agenda aiming to address important health needs of older adults, 2) access to a pool of 83 PRIDE scientists who will be coached to become Peer Mentors, and 3) Dr. Jean-Louis’ leadership in a new fellowship program in translational behavioral sciences in NYU’s Department of Population Health. Dr. Jean-Louis’ research program comprises several trials ascertaining effectiveness of tailored interventions to increase adoption of sleep health messages. These are complemented by use of mix-methods approaches to study psychosocial and cultural factors affecting health practices in diverse communities. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Provide a forum in which mid- to senior-level investigators in aging research will congregate to forge interdisciplinary collaborations, leading to submission of innovative research proposals; 2) Select and mentor 12 postdoctoral URM scientists with potential to become innovative and creative leaders in the scientific community, applying translational behavioral models to promote healthy aging; and 3) Coach 12 scientists who recently graduated from NYU’s PRIDE Institute to become Peer Mentors. This award will have a strong impact in increasing the academic workforce in sleep and ethnogerontological research.

"Psychosocial Context and the Biological Clock: Changes in Weathering during Middle-Age PROJECT SUMMARY  Unprecedented growth in the proportion of older adults in the U.S. has placed inequalities in healthy aging at the forefront of the public health agenda. Individuals often differ dramatically in their speed of aging. Some demonstrate accelerated aging and suffer early onset of chronic illness whereas others manifest decelerated aging and stave off serious illness well into their 90s. In recent years, researchers have made much headway in understanding the molecular markers of healthy aging, thereby allowing for earlier identification of risk for chronic disease. The proposed research focuses on two such biomarkers of healthy aging – inflammatory aging and methylomic aging. These measures provide us with “biological clocks” that are strongly predictive of age-related physiological decline, disease, and mortality. Having established these molecular measures of the speed of aging, the important question for social scientists and health policy now becomes: To what extent is the speed of aging malleable, for better or worse, in response to natural shifts in psychosocial contexts? This question is the focus of the present proposal. We plan to investigate the extent to which adult social conditions from various domains, but especially those operating within the family, influence speed of biological aging after taking into account childhood experiences and potentially confounding life style factors such as diet, exercise, and smoking. Our objective is to identify the stressors that accelerate aging as well as the supports that decelerate aging. These goals will be pursued using longitudinal data from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS), a 20-year study of well-being among African American mothers, their romantic partners (RPs), and their offspring. A focus on aging among African Americans is important as they tend to suffer from earlier onset and higher prevalence of age-related diseases and a wider range of psychosocial stressors than other ethnic groups. First, we will obtain longitudinal indices of the speed of inflammatory and methylomic aging from the now middle-aged mothers and, if partnered, their RPs by collecting and assaying a new wave of blood data, as well as assaying stored blood from a previous wave. The proposed data will provide the first comprehensive assessment of change in the speed or rate of biological aging during adulthood. Second, we will collect an additional wave of interview data so that changes in supports and stressors can be mapped onto changes in the rate of biological aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Improving the quality of longer lives requires better specified models of healthy aging. Our objective is to identify the stressors that accelerate as well as the supports that decelerate the rate of biological aging.

"Summer of Translational Aging Research for Undergraduates (STARU) PROJECT SUMMARY As the population of older adults increases dramatically, age-related illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other degenerative disorders present a great public health burden, currently affecting an estimated to 5.4 million Americans. It is well documented that older adults from ethnic minority and lower socioeconomic backgrounds are at increased risk for AD and other disorders of aging. There is thus an urgent need to increase the number of scientists from diverse backgrounds who are committed to the study of aging and age- related health disparities. The proposed Summer of Translational Aging Research for Undergraduates (STAR U) program is guided by three axioms related to biomedical research on aging: 1. The diversity of the older adult population is increasing and there are systematic racial/ethnic disparities related to disorders of aging that are poorly understood; 2. Scientific advancement relies upon diversity of background, experience, ideas, and perspectives; increasing the diversity of scientists involved with biomedical research of aging is necessary to provide the cultural sensitivity and knowledge to understand sources of disparities in aging; and 3. Despite increases in the number of underrepresented minorities receiving higher education, a large percentage do not pursue careers in science. STAR U seeks to overcome historic barriers that have prevented such students from pursuing careers in scientific and aging research. Through a structured summer research program, STAR U will provide 10-12 students per year with: 1) individual, tailored research mentorships in the neuroscience of aging; 2) a range of translational learning opportunities; and 3) professional networking and social experiences. Research opportunities will span areas such as patient-oriented clinical research, cognitive neuroscience, basic science, and the epidemiological study of cognitive aging and its disorders. STAR U students will gather formally once per week for a two-hour seminar session that will include one hour devoted to a scientific topic, and one hour devoted to professional/academic development. Scientific training will focus on major themes in aging research, research methodologies, and general content areas relevant to developing scientific careers. Personal and professional development will be fostered through social gatherings as well as seminars on career development, learning how to find and work effectively with mentors, balance personal and professional demands, choosing the type of graduate training that is most appropriate for them, communicating effectively in science, and applying to graduate/medical school effectively. The long-term goal of the Summer of Translational Aging Research for Undergraduates is to enhance the field of aging and age-related disparities research by infusing it with diverse, well-trained scientists.!

"Immunologic Health in Aging PLWH PROJECT SUMMARY In the era of combination antiretroviral therapy, routine care of persons living with HIV infection (PLWH) requires extra attention to coinfections and comorbidities, as PLWH with impaired immunologic competency (IIC) are prone to non-AIDS morbidity and mortality. We propose that IIC is also the basis for accelerated/ premature aging (A/PA) in PLWH and that herpes zoster (shingles) can serve as a readily diagnosed sentinel disease for studying molecular and immunologic correlates of A/PA. To prove these concepts, we have already gathered compelling data from a Southeast US cohort of PLWH (N = 4,225) to demonstrate that relatively young PLWH (30-55 years old) are already at high risk of developing herpes zoster, but recurrent herpes zoster is relatively rare. New research can now focus on the disparity between biological age and chronological age in PLWH and on the dynamics of immune protection against recurrent herpes zoster. Specifically, aim 1 will identify DNA methylation (epigenetic) age and molecular signatures of memory T-cells shortly before the onset of herpes zoster, using high-throughput techniques to define genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles. Aim 2 will compare virus-specific T-cell activation, proliferation and immune function after co-culture with pools of immunogens derived from the varicella-zoster virus, using samples from two visits after the first occurrence of herpes zoster. These studies will target two primary ethnic groups (African Americans and European Americans) with disparate HIV/AIDS burdens and will properly account for potential confounders (e.g., coinfections and comorbidities) as observed in a clinical setting. For further translation, analyses of DNA methylation age (aim 1) should help with the design and implementation of interventional strategies for alleviating or reversing IIC in diverse PLWH populations, including the application of a newly available recombinant vaccine (Shingrix) against herpes zoster. PROJECT NARRATIVE HIV infection severely impairs immunological competence and accelerates aging. In order to better understand the compounding health issues in persons living with HIV infection, this 2-year project aims to identify correlates of biological age and immunologic health, using herpes zoster as a sentinel disease outcome.",Immunologic Health in Aging PLWH,9735083,R21AI134282,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Attention ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chronology ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Esters ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' herpes zona ', ' Zoster ', ' Zona ', ' Shingles ', ' Herpes Zoster ', ' Herpes zoster disease ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HLA-MT Antigens ', ' HLA-MT ', ' HLA-DR ', ' HLA-D-Related Antigens ', ' HLA-BR Antigens ', ' HLA-BR ', ' HLA-DR Antigens ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunological Competence ', ' Immunologic Competence ', ' Immunocompetence ', ' Immunological System Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immunodeficiency and Immunosuppression Disorders ', ' Immune System and Related Disorders ', ' Immune System Dysfunction ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Kinetics ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methylation ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Immunosurveillance ', ' Immunological Monitoring ', ' Immune Monitoring ', ' Immunologic Monitoring ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Using a Randomized Prevention Trial to Understand the Health Benefits of Supportive Couple Relationships among Rural African American Adults PROJECT SUMMARY In this proposal, we seek to follow a well-characterized sample of 346 low-income, middle-age African American couples who recently concluded participation in a randomized prevention trial of the Protecting Strong African American Families (ProSAAF) program. All couples reside in impoverished small towns and communities in rural Georgia in which poverty rates are among the highest in the nation. Individuals in this catchment area are at elevated risk for multiple chronic diseases of aging (CDAs) including cardiovascular disease and diabetes as well as risk factors for CDAs such as inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Continuing to follow this sample with more thorough assessments of aging over the next five years will provide one of the first prospective studies of couple relationships and aging conducted within a randomized prevention trial designed for rural African American adults. As observational designs are prone to residual confounding and reverse directionality errors, the current proposal will provide a unique opportunity for testing casual hypotheses about the role of enhanced couple functioning in promoting and protecting the health of African American adults from the erosive effects of cumulative stress exposure. This proposal, therefore, is directly responsive to PA-15-042, which encourages innovative, hypothesis-driven R01 grant applications that can expand understanding of the role and impact of families and interpersonal relationships on health and well-being in midlife and older age. In this continuation then, we propose to collect two additional waves of multi-level data from couples who participated in the ProSAAF trial. This data collection will involve intravenous blood draws and other biometrics to determine whether ProSAAF participation and program-induced changes in couple functioning will carry forward to promote African Americans' healthy aging. Assessments of psychological well-being and behavioral coping strategies will be collected as well. We will test hypotheses concerning: (a) ProSAAF participation on the physical health and psychological well-being of rural African American adults; (b) mediating mechanisms through which ProSAAF- induced changes in couple relationship functioning and cumulative stress exposure influence rural African Americans' health; and (c) resilience mechanisms on healthy aging among rural African Americans. Hypotheses will be analyzed using individual- and couple-level models to examine actor, partner, and dyadic-level effects. Our proposed design provides both strong tests of theory and enhanced ability to guide practical application than typically is possible using observational research alone. Findings from this research will facilitate the development of health promotion strategies to enhance healthy aging and, ultimately, reduce health disparities among rural African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  African American adults in the rural Southeast have some of the highest rates of chronic diseases of aging, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, cancer, and dementia. These health disparities originate in part from African Americans' exposure to chronic stressors in rural Southern environments. The proposed study will investigate whether participation in a prevention program designed to enhance couple relationships, the Protecting Strong African American Families, will carry forward to promote and protect the health and well-being of rural African American adults.",Using a Randomized Prevention Trial to Understand the Health Benefits of Supportive Couple Relationships among Rural African American Adults,9665668,R01AG059260,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Inflammation ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Weather ', ' cytokine ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Intravenous ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' stressor ', ' Prevention program ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' antiinflammatory ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' protective effect ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' healthy aging ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Prevention trial ', ' trial design ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' rural African American ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2019,652246,0.10067685575278564
"Understanding the Aging Process of Urban African Americans Across the Life Course: Identifying Early Risk and Protection for Cognition and Health in Midlife PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Black Americans experience disproportionate poor aging outcomes, including pronounced disparities in brain health (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease), significant social isolation, and nearly twice the mortality rate compared to Whites. Although it is purported that these adverse health outcomes are due to a combination of greater adversity over the life course and unhealthy coping behaviors, few studies have prospectively examined these aspects of the lives of Blacks from childhood into the 60s. This developmental epidemiological study focuses on life course pathways to successful aging in a large community cohort of urban Blacks first studied at age 6, then in adolescence, and at ages 32 and 42. The proposed fifth round of data collection at age 60 is crucial for examining individual and contextual life course trajectories affecting the aging experience. The specific aims are to: (1) identify the array of aging experiences for the Woodlawn cohort of Blacks at age 60 using indicators of cognitive, physical, functional, social, and mental health, (2) determine specific stressors across the life course that influence aging, and (3) identify specific and malleable protective factors across the life course that promote physical, mental, cognitive and social well-being for urban Blacks. This comprehensive study has followed nearly all children entering first grade in 1966 in Woodlawn, a poor Chicago community (N=1242). We have collected information from mothers, teachers, and official school, criminal, and death records as well as data from cohort members themselves and now have an invaluable opportunity to examine well being comprehensively over the life course for an underinvestigated population. This one-of-a-kind study spanning more than 50 years will allow in-depth exploration of both normative development and deviance, challenging assumptions of Black homogeneity and reframing the current deficit conceptualization, to focus instead on pathways to successful aging, cognitive functioning, and health. Guided by the life course perspective and stress theory, the experienced, uniquely qualified research team will employ advanced locating technology and sophisticated analytical approaches tailored to longitudinal research. This research will contribute to understanding life course influences on aging in urban Blacks. Our long-term goal is to inform intervention development and policy making by identifying critical pivotal influences along the life course that alter aging trajectories and improve health outcomes. In addition, this study will produce a dataset that can be used by us and others for many years to identify complex patterns, subgroup differences, indirect pathways and targets for early intervention that are critical to reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes for at-risk urban Blacks. This work aligns with NIA’s strategic direction, which aims to (1) better understand the effects of personal, interpersonal, and societal factors on later life cognitive impairment (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease, Dementia) and aging, (2) understand health disparities, and (3) develop strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Black Americans experience disproportionately poorer health and higher mortality throughout the life course, disparities of great public health significance. Little is understood about factors that promote successful aging among urban Blacks. This research, which will now span over 50 years, will make unique and important contributions to our understanding of life course influences on aging, cognition, and health among Black Americans, with specific focus on multiple levels of influence, and will inform intervention development and policy by identifying life course risk factors for poor outcomes, as well as pivotal points of influence along the life course that alter risk trajectories.",Understanding the Aging Process of Urban African Americans Across the Life Course: Identifying Early Risk and Protection for Cognition

"Biological mechanisms of risk and resiliency in brain aging among ethnic minorities Abstract Minority health disparities have been well documented in the United States. These disparities exist in the domains of access to healthcare and participation in health research. Ethnic minorities in the United States also have increased risk of cardio- and cerebrovascular disease, stroke, and dementia. It is also known that lifestyle differences (such as exercise and nutrition habits), lower socioeconomic status, and diabetes are risk factors. With the increasing proportion of ethnic minorities in the United States, it is imperative to better understand disease processes that have historically been studied in Caucasian populations. The proportion of elderly that are Hispanic is expected to double, or even triple, in the coming decades. With an increasing population fraction, and increasing life expectancy, it is projected that upwards of a 6-fold increase in Alzheimer's disease will occur in Hispanics. Establishing the trust and partnership between Hispanic communities and world-class researchers is paramount to enable large-scale studies in order to diminish the disparity in minority health research. Our goal is to establish a collaborative foundation between the local minority communities and our research group at the University of Utah. This foundation will greatly facilitate ethnic minority participation in state-of-the-art genetic analysis, such as the newly developed technique of epigenetic aging, and advanced brain imaging research. Succeeding in this goal will allow us to begin to understand the specific risk and resiliency factors related to brain aging in the Hispanic community. The scope of the current project will establish a partnership between local Hispanic communities (approximately 75% Mexican-American) in the Salt Lake City region, neuroimaging researchers at the University of Utah, and collaborators at UCLA. The project will leverage existing university resources, such as the Community/Patient Engagement Studio, to bring the project team members, community stakeholders, and communities in an equal partnership to establish the foundation to perform state-of- the-art genetic and neuroimaging research. The project will synergistically work with local communities to reduce barriers for participation in research. Success of this project will open up avenues that will lead to large-scale studies utilizing cutting edge genetic (epigenetic aging), and neuroimaging techniques that have been applied in studies of Caucasians related to brain aging and Alzheimer's. Utilization of these advanced tools will allow for much-needed research into early signs of brain risk, as well as resiliency, in the Hispanic population. The derived engagement and recruitment strategies, along with these data will form the basis of a future, large-scale study to examine the Alzheimer's disease process in Hispanic-Americans. Narrative Minority health disparities exist in access to healthcare and access to health research. This project will utilize innovative participant engagement strategies, developed in collaboration with Hispanic communities leaders and Hispanic communities in the Salt Lake City region with the purpose of engaging these communities in state-of-the-art genetic and neuroimaging research relevant to aging and Alzheimer's disease. We will specifically work synergistically with these leaders and communities to lower barriers for this ethnic minority group to participate in critical health research.",Biological mechanisms of risk

"Mechanisms of Disparities in Adverse Neurocognitive Outcomes among Hispanics Aging with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY The adverse consequences of HIV and related comorbidities on the central nervous system remain prevalent despite highly effective antiretroviral therapy, with approximately 40% of persons living with HIV showing neurocognitive impairment (NCI). Compared to other ethnic/racial groups in the United States, HIV infected (HIV+) Hispanics/Latinos/as, hereafter referred to as Hispanics, present with increased risk for NCI and neurocognitive decline; and this risk is particularly pronounced in older age. Yet, the factors underlying these disparities are not well understood. Guided by the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework, the present proposal aims to identify key mechanisms underlying adverse neurocognitive outcomes among Hispanics aging with HIV. Among the potential predictors of NCI in this group, the proposed study will focus on two biological processes -- metabolic syndrome and gut microbiome dysbiosis -- that may be particularly problematic among Hispanics and may result in greater brain vulnerability to HIV. The study will also integrate aspects of the physical/built and sociocultural environment (assessed via geocoding) that have been linked to metabolic syndrome and NCI, and investigate their influence on neurocognitive disparities in HIV. We will also explore the impact of behavioral (physical activity and diet) and healthcare (healthcare use and access, health literacy) variables. We will collect these data in 200 HIV+ and HIV-uninfected Hispanics (approximately half Spanish-speaking) aged 40 and over, and investigate their impact on neurocognitive status cross-sectionally and longitudinally over the course of three years. We will leverage existing longitudinal data from the UCSD HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program to select a comparison group of 100 HIV+ non-Hispanic Whites. To ensure the success of the proposed multidisciplinary approach, we have assembled a research team representing an integration of relevant disciplines, including cross-cultural neuropsychology, health disparities, medicine, public health, microbiomics, geography, and bioinformatics, and information systems. Recognizing the importance of a community-based participatory research approach in the study of health disparities, we have partnered with community clinics and stakeholders whose input has helped strengthen our approach and assure its relevance to the community. We will build on existing cross-sectional studies in Hispanics led by the PI for recruitment of participants into the proposed study, and our community partnerships will help assure that we reach the most vulnerable segments of the Hispanic community. With this multidisciplinary and community integrated approach to research, we aim to increase our understanding of the complexity that underlies mechanisms of disparities in neurocognitive outcomes among diverse groups of Hispanics aging with HIV. Such knowledge is crucial for the development of targeted, culturally relevant interventions to prevent or ameliorate HIV-associated NCI among Hispanics and reduce health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed observational longitudinal study aims to determine important mechanisms underlying disparities in neurocognitive outcomes among Hispanics aging with HIV. This is an important public health priority because: 1) the adverse impact of HIV and related comorbidities in the central nervous system are still prevalent and impactful; and 2) HIV-infected Hispanics are at higher risk for neurocognitive impairment, and this disparity is expected to increase with the aging of the HIV-infected population. Understanding factors that increase risk for adverse neurocognitive outcomes associated with HIV and aging among Hispanics may lead to the development of targeted, culturally relevant interventions to prevent and/or decrease HIV-disease progression in the central nervous system among Hispanics and reduce health disparities.",Mechanisms of Disparities in Adverse Neurocognitive Outcomes among Hispanics Aging with HIV,9783891,R01MD013502,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' United States ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' Discipline ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Severities ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' success ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Consequences of HIV ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' health literacy ', ' comparison group ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' public health priorities ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' community partnership ', ' gut microbiome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' Longitudinal observational study ', ' Longitudinal observation study ', ' microbiome research ', ' microbiome studies ', ' microbiome science ', ' Microbiomics ', ' dysbiosis ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' dysbiotic ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' Intestinal permeability ', ' Intestinal Hyperpermeability ', ' Intestinal Epithelial Permeability ', ' Gut permeability ', ' Gut Hyperpermeability ', ' Gut Epithelial Permeability ', ' community clinic ', ' medication nonadherence ', ' medication non-adherence ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,691312,0.09219688751565566
"Center for Improving Care Delivery for the Aging (CICADA) Delivering high-quality, accessible, and affordable health care to older Americans is fundamental to their health, wellbeing, function, and independence. Yet, with a growing chronic disease burden, rapid growth of health care costs, and fragmentation of care delivery, aging Americans are increasingly finding that high- quality care is not available, accessible, or affordable. The health care system in the United States (US) is not organized to address the fundamental health needs of older Americans. Moreover, the persistence of health disparities in the US, particularly for minority elders, suggests that health system dysfunction affects this population disproportionately. There is a critical need to reorganize and reorient health care delivery to coordinate care; maintain and improve quality of life as populations age; address inequities and health disparities; and implement new models of payment rewarding the value of care rather than the volume of care.  Health services research (HSR) studies the organization, financing, and delivery of health care, providing an evidence base that is central to addressing issues of care quality, access, affordability, and equity. HSR is critical to identifying and implementing solutions to improve the current shortcomings of health care delivery and, thus, the health and wellbeing of aging Americans. As a discipline, HSR has been a cornerstone of identifying and addressing disparities in health and health care delivery.  Minority investigators are underrepresented in HSR, with Blacks and Hispanics accounting for only 6.9% and 3.7%, respectively, of the HSR workforce. Yet underrepresented HSR researchers bring essential diverse perspectives and, often, personal experiences to bear in understanding the social, economic, political, and environmental determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care. Furthermore, according to the federal Office of Minority Health, underrepresentation in research leads to underfunding of health research as well as a lack of culturally appropriate theories, models, and methodologies. Thus, developing a representative cadre of researchers who can undertake studies that address the challenges facing our aging population and, in particular, disparities in aging, is an absolute priority.  To address this need, we propose the Center for Improving Care Delivery for the Aging (CICADA), a Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). CICADA aims to train emerging scientists from underrepresented backgrounds in the interdisciplinary science of HSR as it applies to the most pressing issues for aging Americans, particularly minority elders. Redressing researchers from backgrounds underrepresentation in HSR is critical to finding innovative public health solutions, creating a robust learning environment, and developing the trust needed to implement innovative solutions in minority populations.

"Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research will create five different one-day conferences on current NIA priority areas relevant to minority aging research. The conference series goal is to increase the quality, quantity, and relevance to communities of color of NIA-fundable research by providing both junior and senior researchers with new knowledge and greater interest in these emerging issues as applied to minority elderly. This is significant because the U.S. racial and ethnic minority older population is growing rapidly: minorities will increase from 25% to over 40% of the older population between 2020 and 2050. Protecting and improving the health of these elderly requires a highly skilled research workforce with interests and capabilities to produce new and useful knowledge. Yet the number and success of minority researchers funded by NIH is insufficient. The NIA's Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) program works to mentor and train junior faculty who conduct research on minority aging to strengthen the next generation of NIA-funded ethnic and racial minority research and researchers. Conferences topics are: Recruitment and retention of elders of color; Access to care & improved outcomes for cognitively impaired minority elderly; Applying the science of behavior change to intervention development for elders of color; Pragmatic intervention trials with minority elders; and Using biological measures of risk in health disparities research with older adults. Each will feature leading scholars on the topic, top scholars on minority aging, and representatives from multiple NIA-funded centers and networks. The programs will disseminate the state of the art on the topic, inform researchers on how existing research can be modified or expanded to be more valid and relevant for minority elders, and provide resources that can be used by researchers to further develop the fields in research with minority elders. They will be held as preconferences to the Gerontological Society of America (GSA) annual scientific meetings with an average of 50 participants each; the majority will be minorities and/or women. The planning committee will be compromised of the confirmed keynote speakers who are leaders in the field and researchers from RCMAR sites with expertise in the topic. The executive committee will be the RCMAR directors group. The project is innovative in the topics covered, the research networks involved, and the synergy with GSA. Program evaluation includes a process evaluation, a retrospective pre/post knowledge and confidence survey, and four-month follow-up survey on conference impacts. The lead investigators are national leaders in minority and aging research who have successfully led previous GSA preconferences. This proposal is a renewal of the previous successful series with new topics but similar objectives of improving the knowledge and interest in emerging issues supported by NIA among those with research agendas in minority aging and raising awareness of minority aging among leading researchers in each topic. Emerging Issues in Minority Aging Research: This project will create five different one-day conferences on current NIA initiatives that are relevant to minority aging research.

"Racial/Ethnic Differences in Reproductive Aging and Onset of Cardio-metabolic Risk in the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation: Methodological Challenges in Aging Cohorts 7 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Racial/ethnic disparities in life expectancy are well documented. These disparities are mainly due to excess mortality among Blacks from cardio-metabolic conditions such as hypertension, heart disease and diabetes. Racial/ethnic disparities in aging and health deterioration are posited to stem from “weathering” or early health deterioration as a consequence of the cumulative impact of repeated experience with social or economic adversity and political marginalization. Corroborating this theory, studies have observed that the racial/ethnic differences in mortality become more pronounced in midlife and early old age when the risk for cardio- metabolic disease increases, particularly for women. It is hypothesized that the increase in risk in midlife women could be related to the end of hormonal production or reproductive aging, signaled by the timing of the final menstrual period (FMP). However, it is unclear if the increase in risk is due to reproductive aging or aging in general. Evidence of racial/ethnic differences in reproductive aging has been mixed. This may be partially due to selection bias into cohorts of aging, caused by systematically excluding women who experience early aging (left-truncation) or employing selection criteria that may unintentionally exclude high- risk groups. Because cohorts are set up to assess the incidence of an outcome, if the potential variability in average rate of aging is not considered upon recruitment, cohorts could be subject to selection bias. Furthermore, as Black women have a higher rate of surgical amenorrhea due to higher rates of hysterectomies/oophorectomies from reproductive complications earlier in life, they are often systematically excluded from estimates of reproductive aging. The multi-racial/ethnic Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) recruited women at 42-52 years of age and does not include women who had surgical amenorrhea. SWAN has a wealth of data at each stage of selection for the cohort making it ideal for developing a statistical approach to handling selection bias due to left-truncation. Therefore, we propose to use SWAN to develop and demonstrate the impact of selection bias on estimates of racial/ethnic differences in reproductive aging (Aim 1) and on racial/ethnic differences in timing of cardio-metabolic risk (Aim 2a). We will also assess whether racial/ethnic differences in cardio-metabolic risk are more pronounced before or after the FMP (Aim 2b). This work will contribute to research on aging by developing a novel statistical approach to correct for selection bias in aging cohorts that may miss the window of risk leading to left truncation or that have exclusion criteria that leads to systematic selection of healthier persons. Correction for such bias is principally important when estimating average age of disease onset and health disparities in aging. This research – made possible by the support of this fellowship, the University of Michigan and collaboration with my distinguished mentors – will continue to advance my applied knowledge of epidemiologic methods and will be essential to my continued growth as an independent scholar focused on racial/ethnic disparities in aging. 8 PROJECT NARRATIVE Black women are hypothesized to be subject to early reproductive aging and cardio-metabolic health risk contributing to Black/White differences in life expectancy. In order to obtain unbiased estimates, cohorts of aging must consider if they have systematically excluded persons who experience early aging (left-truncation) or employed a selection criteria that may unintentionally exclude high-risk groups inducing selection bias. This work contributes to research on aging by developing a novel statistical approach to simultaneously correct for selection bias into and out of cohort studies, and by examining the impact of selection bias on racial/ethnic differences in reproductive aging and timing of cardio-metabolic risk in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN).",Racial/Ethnic Differences in Reproductive Aging and Onset of Cardio-metabolic Risk in the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation: Methodological Challenges in Aging Cohorts,9832465,F31AG064856,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Amenorrhea ', ' amenia ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Gynecology ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Hysterectomy ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Menopause ', ' monthly period ', ' menstrual period ', ' Menses ', ' Menstruation ', ' Mentors ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' female gonadectomy ', ' Oophorectomy ', ' Ovariectomy ', ' Play ', ' Politics ', ' Probability ', ' Production ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Weather ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Lateral ', ' Chronic ', ' Gynecologic ', ' Age of Onset ', ' disability ', ' Truncation Bias ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Collaborations ', ' steroid hormone ', ' Therapeutic Steroid Hormone ', ' Metabolic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Hormonal ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Exclusion ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' social ', ' reproductive ', ' Deterioration ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' stem ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' screening ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' reproductive senescence ', ' spermatozoal senescence ', ' spermatozoa senescence ', ' sperm senescence ', ' sperm cell senescence ', ' reproductive cell senescence ', ' reproductive aging ', ' ovulatory senescence ', ' ovarian senescence ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', "" Study of Women's Health Across the Nation "", ' recruit ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2019,38319,0.17559318781536604

"Improving the Health of Low-SES Americans Approaching Retirement Under the Affordable Care Act PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Renuka Tipirneni, MD, MSc is a general internist and junior health services researcher focused on improving the health care system for prematurely aging low socioeconomic status (SES) adults approaching retirement age. Dr. Tipirneni's long-term career objective is to become an independent mixed methods investigator integrating large-scale clinical and economic data with in-depth qualitative data to inform the design and evaluation of policies and programs to improve the health of low-SES aging adults. Research Context: Low-SES Americans approaching retirement face a crisis of poor health and markedly increasing mortality. Between 2001 and 2014, disparities in life expectancy between low- and high-SES adults near retirement have widened and this may have accounted for 500,000 excess deaths. Yet the drivers of this crisis are poorly understood. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) should improve access to care through insurance expansions and care delivery innovations and help this group manage chronic conditions and improve their health. However, it is not clear how low-SES aging adults are specifically benefitting from ACA policies, which groups should be principally targeted for new care delivery programs encouraged under the ACA, and what factors are associated with successful health improvement and decreased costs for at-risk aging Americans. Specific Aims: 1) Determine changes in coverage, access, utilization, health and financial stress for low-SES 55-64-year-olds before and after the ACA Medicaid expansion; 2) Classify sub-groups of low-SES 55-64-year- olds at highest risk of poor health and characterize heterogeneity of changes in access, utilization, health and costs in identified high-risk sub-groups; 3) Identify facilitators of and barriers to improvements in health outcomes and health care utilization among high-risk low-SES aging adults in an ACA care delivery program. Research Plan: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Tipirneni will perform quasi-experimental analyses with the Health and Retirement Study to assess health and health care changes before and after the ACA. She will then identify sub-groups of low-SES near retirement adults at high risk of poor health trajectories. Lastly, she will conduct qualitiatve interviews with low-SES near retirement adults in an ACA care delivery program to identify facilitators of and barriers to health improvement and decreased high-cost utilization. Career Development Plan: Dr. Tipirneni will develop expertise in 1) analysis of large-scale longitudinal survey and administrative data; 2) application of quasi-experimental approaches to evaluate programs; 3) mixed methods research; and 4) programmatic research focused on aging adults. Dr. Tipirneni's career development goals will be supported by close mentorship from an interdisciplinary team; advanced didactic coursework; participation in research and career development meetings/seminars; and ongoing guidance in her research. Environment: The University of Michigan offers the ideal environment for her to pursue this training, with the outstanding guidance of well-established mentors and interdisciplinary institutes dedicated to her success. PROJECT NARRATIVE Low-income Americans approaching retirement age have been increasingly dying at alarming rates compared with higher-income Americans, yet the drivers of this crisis are poorly understood. The Affordable Care Act's new insurance options and health care delivery programs may offer strategies to help at-risk aging Americans, but it is not clear who should be targeted for such policies and programs and which elements are most helpful. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify potentially modifiable risk factors for poor health among these at-risk aging Americans in order to help design and evaluate policies and programs to improve the health of low-SES aging adults.",Improving the Health of Low-SES Americans Approaching Retirement Under the Affordable Care Act,9964607,K08AG056591,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Award ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Premature Aging ', ' Premature aging syndrome ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Internist ', ' Respondent ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Physical Function ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' cohort ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' experimental analysis ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' Medicare claim ', ' patient profile ', ' profiles in patients ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Time trend ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2020,167400,0.11280738603738408
"An Experimental Investigation into the Impact of Socioeconomic Context on Biological Markers of Aging, Health and Mortality Poverty disproportionately impacts minority and rural populations and is very strongly correlated with poor health over the life cycle, and has been hypothesized to lead to a shorter, less healthy aging process. Poverty is associated with a greater burden of disease than smoking and obesity combined and accounts for the bulk of health disparities by race. It is widely believed that an anti-poverty policy—such as Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)—could improve healthy aging among working-age low-income adults over the life cycle. It does so by increasing material hardship and psychological stress—two risk factors that are strongly correlated with biological markers of premature aging (e.g., shorter telomeres, higher cholesterol levels, and higher blood pressure.) However, the literature linking poverty to health is largely built on correlational data, which is subject to confounding and reverse causation. The experienced research firm MDRC has secured private and public funding for a groundbreaking multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) that examines the causal impacts of quadrupling EITC for working adults without dependent children in Atlanta, GA and New York City, NY called Paycheck Plus (PP). Randomization exposes the treatment group to up to $2000 in PP compared to up to $496 in the control group. However, MDRC is not studying the impacts of PP on health. We propose leveraging MDRC’s existing infrastructure and our long history of collaboration with MDRC to add clinical, survey, and administrative measures to explore whether PP improves the health and survival of adult recipients without dependent children. Timed with launch of the study in Atlanta, we propose in-person health screenings with collection of important biomarkers of chronic disease, such as blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), blood glucose, cholesterol, and C-reactive protein (measures that are conceptually linked to poverty). For both the NYC and Atlanta Cohorts, we propose adding survey data that measures health-related quality of life and depression. Since not everybody randomized to the treatment group will file taxes (a requisite for the treated group to receive PP or the control group to receive traditional EITC), we will analyze our health outcomes using an Intent to Treat (ITT) versus Treatment on the Treated (ToT) analysis. This will produce Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) estimates of the unbiased impact of increased PP on health. In addition, we will collect long-term follow up data on mortality for both treatment sites. We will do so by linking individual identifiers administrative mortality data from the National Death Index. Finally, we will model the health and longevity gains associated with PP relative to traditional EITC. This project is innovative for exploiting a planned and fully funded social science experiment to explore outcome measures that were not originally considered by the policymakers. This project is also innovative for being a RTC of an anti-poverty program that uses administrative and clinical health data at a very low cost. We anticipate that PP will be an efficient approach to promoting healthy aging by lifting adults without dependent children out of poverty. Narrative The Columbia University team has partnered with the research firm MDRC to conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) that examines the health and survival outcomes associated with an extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for lower-income Americans without dependent children. Associational evidence suggests that EITC may have a significant impact on the health and survival over the life cycle of those who receive the credit, leading to healthy aging. However, experimental data is needed to prove this linkage.","An Experimental Investigation into the Impact of Socioeconomic Context on Biological Markers of Aging, Health and

"A Model of Accelerated Aging:  Social, Political, Economic, Environmental, and Biological Factors' Effects on Osteoporosis, High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein, and Telomere Length Abstract Osteoporosis, due to aging, is a significant public health concern across the world because of the association with fractures. Fractures are expected to be increasingly costly for the government and individuals in the United States due to the large aging population of Baby Boomers. Accelerated aging may further compound these effects, yet our understanding of the causes of accelerated aging is incomplete. Prolonged stress from social, economic, biological, environmental, and political factors appears to cause an increase in inflammatory biomarkers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP). Many such stressors have also been linked to osteoporosis and shortened telomere length (STL), but definitive answers about whether these outcomes are a consequence of increased inflammation are missing because most studies have focused only on a subset of potential stressors and have not explored the wide range of variables that could potentially affect these indicators. In this study we develop a holistic model of the relationship among biological, social, economic, political, and environmental stressors, inflammation (measured via CRP), and osteoporosis and STL (as indicators of accelerated aging), which is a novel contribution to the field. We consider the possibility of heterogeneous treatment effects of inflammation on outcomes. We further create a disease risk score tool for use in public health or clinical settings to assess the risk of accelerated aging for osteoporosis and STL, that can incorporate CRP values from CRP point-of-care testing and is based on exposure to relevant stressors. To accomplish these aims we analyze data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), in combination with contextual data from the following sources: 1) the HRS Contextual Data Resource (HRS-CDR), 2) The Dynamics of State Policy Liberalism, 1936-2014 (political data), 3) Environmental Protection Agency (air quality), and 4) Environmental Working Group (EWG) (water-quality data). We expect our findings to shift how researchers and clinicians think about stressors by considering a variety of sources and evaluating how those stressors affect inflammation and osteoporosis and STL. Furthermore, our disease risk score tool has the potential to change the way clinicians practice preventive medicine and reduce health disparities as a result. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance Statement Accelerated aging can affect quality of life, reduce labor productivity, and lead to increased medical costs. Prolonged stress can lead to chronic inflammation, which results in negative health outcomes, many of which are associated with conditions of older age. Many life stressors (e.g., biological, social, political, economic, and environmental) are associated with: 1) increases in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, which is a commonly used marker of inflammation; 2) osteoporosis; and 3) shortened telomere length, which are associated with increased risk of fracture, and thus increased medical costs.","A Model of Accelerated Aging:  Social, Political, Economic, Environmental, and Biological Factors' Effects on Osteoporosis, High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein, and Telomere Length",9880678,R15AG063330,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Americas ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Bone Density ', ' Bone Mineral Density ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Fishes ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Hip Fractures ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Liberalism ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Play ', ' Political Factor ', ' Politics ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' United States ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' point of care testing ', ' Bedside Testings ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' environmental stressor ', ' stressor ', ' water quality ', ' bone loss ', ' novel ', ' holistic approach ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' social stress ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Telomere Shortening ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' cost ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' treatment effect ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' health data ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' fracture risk ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' data resource ', ' care costs ', ' baby boomer ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF LA VERNE,R15,2020,389611,0.06824000097384518

"Education, socioeconomic status and Aging: transitions from multimorbidity to functional limitations and mortality Project Summary Recent data suggest ongoing increases in life expectancy are accompanied by widening socioeconomic differences in life expectancy and disability. The overarching aim of this application is to understand the role of socioeconomic factors in shaping ageing outcomes, the innovation lies in the use of multi-state models (MSM) to study multiple health events that occur over the course of aging. Much of the research on aging uses time-to-event or survival analysis, where only one health outcome (chronic disease, multimorbidity, disability, or death) can be examined at a time and the inter-relationships among these outcomes are not considered. We propose to use MSM to examine the role of socioeconomic factors in transitions from a healthy state to chronic disease, to subsequent multimorbidity, to disability and death in a single analytic framework using 30-years follow-up in the Whitehall study. We identify multimorbidity due to aging of populations and poor understanding of their impact on functional impairment, disability and death critical to understanding social disparities in health at older ages. The cross-sectional nature of much of the research on multimorbidity and disability does not allow identification of prevention targets that could be used to close the gap in health status of older adults. Our approach focuses on transitions or changes in health states with ageing and examines the role of socioeconomic factors and how psychosocial, behavioral, and biological factors explain social disparities in these transitions. Our proposal is based on the Whitehall study which has pioneered research on health inequalities. We propose to examine socioeconomic disparities and underlying mechanisms in chronic diseases, transitions to multimorbidity and mortality (AIM 1), examine whether socioeconomic factors buffer the association of multimorbidity with disability, and that of disability with mortality and identify underlying mechanisms (AIM 2), and assess the role of SES in shaping the association of functional impairment (subjective and objective assessments) with mortality, and its role in terminal decline, i.e. accelerated decline in function prior to death (AIM 3). Increased life expectancy and reduced disability rates in the high socioeconomic groups suggest that it is possible to improve aging outcomes in the entire population to ensure that most older adults remain healthy, active, and independent for as long as possible. In order to do this, better understanding is needed of the pathways through which high SES promotes health and functioning at older ages; evidence that this proposal aims to generate. Project Narrative Socioeconomic disparities in health are one of the most consistent findings of epidemiologic research; ongoing increases in life expectancy are accompanied by widening socioeconomic differences in longevity and disability even in high income countries. We propose to use longitudinal data on the same set of persons followed prospectively over 30 years in the Whitehall study to identify how socioeconomic circumstances affect stages of aging and underlying mechanisms. We will examine the role of socioeconomic factors in onset of chronic disease, progression to multimorbidity, to disability, and death using multi-state models which allow analysis of all these transitions. The overarching objective is to identify stages in aging over the lifecourse and underlying risk factors which are responsible for increasing social disparities in health at older ages.","Education, socioeconomic status and Aging: transitions from multimorbidity to functional limitations and mortality",9967940,R01AG056477,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Buffers ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' cognitive function ', ' Event ', ' Country ', ' Physical Function ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' Terminal Illness ', ' terminal decline ', ' Terminal Disease ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' functional decline ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' social disadvantage ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,R01,2020,407157,0.03844984813942414
"Clin-STAR Coordinating Center Project Summary The US continues to suffer a critical shortage of well-trained clinicians to address the needs of a growing aging population. Historically, non-geriatricians have not focused on the needs of older adults. Hence, clinicians in other specialties must be trained and encouraged to focus their practice and research on the age-related aspects of their discipline. Although important progress has been made through initiatives that integrate geriatrics and aging research into the medical, surgical and other clinical disciplines, further significant commitment is needed to train the future leaders in aging research. This U24 proposal seeks to accelerate these efforts by building a robust, multi-faceted and highly-networked national platform that will organize activities and provide resources for the cultivation, connection, and synergy of clinician-scientists in aging research from disparate disciplines across the US. This objective will be achieved through a set of four specific aims: 1) to develop an organizational structure that will facilitate the exchange and dissemination of scientific and research knowledge on aging and the care of older persons; 2) to provide mentoring and career development support for emerging investigators committed to pursuing aging research in their clinical discipline; 3) to stimulate aging research, foster networking and collaborations across disciplines, and identify and support high priority and understudied areas of aging research; 4) to develop and implement strategies for assessing the effectiveness of the Clin-STAR program and to use this information to guide future directions and report outcomes to stakeholders. The Clin-STAR Coordinating Center will accomplish these aims through a broad array of strategic initiatives, including: developing a Clin-STAR website, social media presence, and database that connects Clin-STAR investigators; organizing webinars, annual meetings and content-focused transdisciplinary interest groups; identifying and partnering with other relevant networks; providing mentorship and professional development resources; and supporting pilot grants, mini-sabbaticals and visiting professorships. The Clin-STAR Coordinating Center will leverage the accumulated research, career develop- ment, and mentoring expertise of over 20 clinician investigators (4 PIs, 10 co-investigators, and 8 advisory board members) across 20 institutions, in partnership with the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR), which will serve as the National Program Office for the proposed activities. Innovative features include an organizational structure that includes 3 prominent academic resource centers that will support core- specific activities; leveraging the community of Beeson Scholars and NIA K24 recipients; an annual meeting that will abut the highly successful Beeson Annual Meeting; creation of an Outreach Fund that will support an array of opportunities to build leadership skills, support career development, raise the visibility of aging research, and promote the Clin-STAR Program; a novel evaluative approach based on network science; and efforts to establish a public-private partnership through philanthropy and leveraging existing relationships. Project Narrative Substantial human capital investments by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and private partners have led to a growing number of clinician-scientists in aging research from a diverse array of specialties and disciplines. The pipeline of early-stage and established investigators would benefit greatly from a national platform that will convey scientific and research knowledge, foster networking and collaboration, provide mentoring and career development support, and advance transdisciplinary research.

"Enhancing Leadership Capacity to Mentor Scientists in Translational Behavioral AD-Related Research Project Summary Community-engaged research, focusing on patient-centered outcomes (PCO), is critical in translating scientific evidence into health benefits for the aging US population. There’s limited focus on understanding associations of sleep with brain health and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among older adults, particularly minorities who are disproportionately burdened by Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Consistent with the NIH roadmap of translating research into practice, it is paramount that health professionals be trained to pursue careers in PCO that promote healthy aging. The K07 leadership award will serve as (a) a collaborative learning laboratory and (b) a resource to stimulate, support, and evaluate high-priority translational aging research in diverse communities. It will coalesce a network of renowned investigators to tackle adverse sleep-related CVD outcomes in a diverse aging population. It will also address a critical deficiency in the academic workforce by mentoring junior scientists to pursue careers in translational behavioral research and to become effective mentors. The plan builds upon Dr. Jean-Louis’ leadership in implementing community research and mentoring programs. Its strong likelihood of success is anchored by his outstanding experience engaging multiple stakeholders supporting aging-related research initiatives. The K07 plan will be implemented in an outstanding academic environment for translational behavioral research. It leverages several NYU resources, particularly those of the CTSI, the Center for Healthful Behavior Change, the Center for Brain Health, and the Sleep Disorders Center. Other enhancements to this environment include: 1) a community-academic partnership with a shared aging research agenda aiming to address important health needs of older adults, 2) access to a pool of 83 PRIDE scientists who will be coached to become Peer Mentors, and 3) Dr. Jean-Louis’ leadership in a new fellowship program in translational behavioral sciences in NYU’s Department of Population Health. Dr. Jean-Louis’ research program comprises several trials ascertaining effectiveness of tailored interventions to increase adoption of sleep health messages. These are complemented by use of mix-methods approaches to study psychosocial and cultural factors affecting health practices in diverse communities. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Provide a forum in which mid- to senior-level investigators in aging research will congregate to forge interdisciplinary collaborations, leading to submission of innovative research proposals; 2) Select and mentor 12 postdoctoral URM scientists with potential to become innovative and creative leaders in the scientific community, applying translational behavioral models to promote healthy aging; and 3) Coach 12 scientists who recently graduated from NYU’s PRIDE Institute to become Peer Mentors. This award will have a strong impact in increasing the academic workforce in sleep and ethnogerontological research.

"Optimal Longevity: Mechanisms, Reducing health disparities, and increasing healthspan Project Summary/Abstract This R13 conference grant will help further the field of behavioral medicine, lead to novel integration with cutting edge research on aging, and support promising early stage investigators in these areas. The transdisciplinary field of behavioral medicine builds on an understanding of behavioral, biomedical, and psychosocial mechanisms to reduce costly chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular and psychiatric disease. However, it has not targeted biological aging as an outcome. Research on biology of aging and geroscience examines common mechanisms of disease, but does not emphasize behavioral and social factors. The integration of these fields holds tremendous promise for understanding disease pathways and improving prevention by slowing biological aging processes. It is imperative to better integrate a geroscience focus into behavioral medicine research. The Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research (AMBR) annual meeting provides a highly interactive forum for thought leaders to exchange transdisciplinary ideas often with a high impact on research programs and collaborations. In June 2020, the focus will be on “Optimal Longevity: Mechanisms, health disparities, and increasing healthspan.” Confirmed keynote speakers include Elizabeth Blackburn (cell aging mechanisms), Eileen Crimmins (socio- and biodemography of aging), Terrie Moffitt (early life, mental health, aging trajectories), Daniel Belsky (social disadvantage and biological indices of aging), and Bonnie Kaplan (nutrition, aging, and mental health). Drawing on the deep expertise of ABMR members, symposium and discussion topics focus on mechanisms of disease and aging such as stress and discrimination, vagal regulation, personality, mindfulness, and self-regulation in understanding trajectories of aging. We will address questions such as how to best measure healthspan, biological aging trajectories, biobehavioral risk factors, and interventions to slow aging and target cancer and other diseases of aging. The program will be overseen by ABMR President Elissa Epel, council members, and the planning committee. Dr. Epel has experience in chairing conferences and a strong commitment to mentoring the next generation of researchers. Our aims are: To introduce behavioral medicine researchers to critical topics in healthy longevity; 2) To support Early Stage Investigators, particularly URM, interested in integrating behavioral medicine and aging research to attend the conference and receive a mentored experience; 3) To implement a mentored experience, strategies for sustaining and strengthening investigator independence and leadership. This includes a leadership workshop, NIH led roundtable, process group, and mentor assignments. We had 21% URM faculty in 2019 and we aim to grow representation in 2020. This R13 will increase the success of future generations of diverse behavioral medicine researchers, as well as help integrate cutting edge issues in healthy longevity into behavioral medicine research programs widely. Dissemination of the conference proceedings will include a special issue in Psychosomatic Medicine. Project Narrative The annual scientific meeting of the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research (ABMR) is a unique highly interactive forum for established scientists and thought leaders to exchange cutting-edge, transdisciplinary ideas to better understand disease processes, prevention and intervention. This R13 conference grant will bring pioneers in the mechanisms of aging--behavioral, social and biological—leading to an innovative integration of behavioral medicine and optimal aging research. It will also provide a mentored track for ten promising young behavioral medicine investigators to attend the conference, benefit from leadership training and career mentoring, and learn cutting edge issues in behavioral medicine and aging research.","Optimal Longevity: Mechanisms, Reducing health disparities, and increasing healthspan",9993903,R13AG067667,"['Academy ', ' Aging ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Group Processes ', ' social group process ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Personality ', ' Psychosomatic Medicine ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Biological Aging ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Future Generations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' cost ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Mind ', ' Psychoneuroendocrinology ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' healthy aging ', ' mindfulness ', ' biodemography ', ' Secure ', ' Geroscience ', ' summer research ', ' health-span ', ' healthspan ', ' social factors ', ' social disadvantage ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R13,2020,50000,0.14245831982413198
"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M).

"Appalachian Gerontology Experiences - Advancing Diversity in Aging Research Appalachian Gerontology Experiences: Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (AGE-ADAR) Specific Aims Appalachia is a predominantly rural area in which 25 million Americans reside. The region includes all of West Virginia and portions of 12 other states. Relative to the rest of the United States, West Virginian Appalachia is rugged and mountainous, which creates geographic barriers to medical and psychosocial services. Residents of the region also live with lower annual incomes, higher poverty, higher unemployment, and higher morbidity and mortality rates than other areas of the nation (Appalachian Regional Commission, 2017). Thus, it is a region marked by significant health disparities. Health disparities are more pronounced in the rural areas of Appalachia and are a complex result of health behaviors, personal resources, and macro-environmental influences. Although rural-dwelling adults have many of the same needs as adults aging in other environments, there are unique issues presented by a rural context. Thus, as we have argued elsewhere, aging is harder in rural areas (Hash, Jurkowski, & Krout, 2015). For many Appalachian residents, there is a strong sense of place-identity, with an historical mistrust of “outsiders” who often lack the cultural competence to address the nuances and complexities of Appalachian culture. Thus, what is needed is a cadre of health professionals and researchers who are well-versed in the science of aging, the science of health disparities, and the culture of Appalachia. To that end, we propose a highly-scaffolded education experience to increase interest in and diversity among researchers in aging and health disparities in Appalachia. The overarching goals of this project align with the goals of the NIA to increase interest in reducing health disparities and increasing the representation of historically underrepresented scholars in the fields of aging and health disparities research. To accomplish these goals, the proposed educational program would provide: focused educational content on research methods, aging, health disparities, Appalachia and other rural areas. The program would include structured, hands-on research experiences and mentored research experiences. We would nurture an appreciation for applied/translational research and community-based dissemination, thus increasing the health literacy and scientific literacy in the region. Together, these experiences would prepare scholars to infuse a healthy aging approach to their work. Specifically, the proposed program would: 1. provide culturally- and regionally-relevant educational content on aging, health disparities, Appalachia and other rural areas; 2. provide an intensive introduction to research methods, including completion of at least  one structured group research experience focused on health disparities and a second mentored, health-related aging research experience with a faculty sponsor in the student's home discipline; 3. create and reinforce an identity of being an aging and health disparities researcher who will contribute to the research workforce in aging; 4. coach students on scientific writing and professional development; and 5. increase scientific and health literacy in the community through broad dissemination of research findings. Diversity among scientists increases our ability to solve the problems facing society. The proposed educational program seeks to increase the diversity of the workforce in aging and health disparities as a means to reduce such health disparities. Focusing on students who are typically underrepresented in the MSTEM fields, the Appalachia Gerontology Experiences (AGE) Scholars Program would provide content knowledge and hands-on experiences in aging and health disparities research.",Appalachian Gerontology Experiences - Advancing Diversity in Aging Research,9793672,R25AG059558,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aging ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Group Structure ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Poverty ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Science ', ' Psychiatric Social Work ', ' Psychiatric Social Service ', ' psychosocial service ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' United States ', ' West Virginia ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Discipline ', ' Rural ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' cultural competence ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Scholars Program ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' health literacy ', ' dissemination research ', ' healthy aging ', ' scientifically literate ', ' scientific literacy ', ' hands on research ', ' rural dwelling ', ' rural households ', ' rural residence ', ' ']",NIA,WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY,R25,2020,311723,0.17298915410847773
"Linking 1940 U.S. Census Data to Five Modern Surveys of Health and Aging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will link records from the 1940 U.S. Census to records for respondents to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS); the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID); the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS); the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP); and the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). These ongoing longitudinal studies are the cornerstones of America's data infrastructure for interdisciplinary research on aging and the life course; physical and mental health, disability, and well-being; later-life work, economic well-being, and retirement; and end-of-life issues. A crucial limitation of these studies is that they contain little information about social, economic, family, neighborhood, and environmental circumstances in childhood and young adulthood. The sparse early-life information that is now available is usually collected retrospectively in later adulthood; the quality of these few retrospective reports is largely unknown. This serious limitation of these data hinders researchers' ability to study the long-term impacts of childhood and young adult circumstances and to understand how later-life outcomes are the result of cumulative life-course processes. Linking these studies to the 1940 U.S. Census will produce data infrastructure that vastly expands their analytic utility for a variety of substantive problem. This project involves (1) preparing and formatting data files containing respondents' identifying information; (2) deploying sophisticated machine linking algorithms to link the project records to the 1940 U.S. Census; (3) hand linking records that cannot be machine linked and hand-verifying a portion of those that can; (6) creating individual-, family-, and contextual/spatial-leel variables that are consistent with IPUMS and comparable across projects; (7) documenting the new measures and making them available as part of projects' restricted access dissemination systems in a manner consistent with respondents' privacy rights; (8) publicizing the resulting measures and conducting user outreach to maximize the utility and visibility of the new data resource; and (9) conducting methodological analyses to assess the validity of retrospective reports of childhood social and economic circumstances. The project will be led by a team from the Minnesota Population Center in collaboration with each projects' leadership team. The researchers have considerable expertise in the construction and analysis of longitudinal studies of health and aging and in historical record linkage using machine and hand linking techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will substantially improve basic infrastructure for demographic, social scientific, and public health research on aging, retirement, health, mortality, economic circumstances, and well-being in later adulthood; it will transform our ability to understand the long-term impact of social, economic, genetic, demographic, neighborhood, contextual, and environmental circumstances and exposures in early life on any of the later-life outcomes observed in America's most important studies of health, aging, and retirement. The proposed work is directly relevant to the central mission of the NIH as the steward of medical and behavioral research for the nation: the resulting data will advance fundamental knowledge about population health and population dynamics and will spawn a new generation of research across disciplines.",Linking 1940 U.S. Census Data to Five Modern Surveys of Health and Aging,9841338,R01AG050300,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Coal ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Hand ', ' Household Heads ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Industry ', ' Labor Forces ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Marital Status ', ' Marriage ', ' Marriage Ages ', ' age at marriage ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mission ', ' Modernization ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Birth Place ', ' Play ', ' Population Density ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Power Plants ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retirement ', ' Rights ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' School Enrollments ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tongue ', ' Veterans ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Privacy ', ' Family member ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Discipline ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Data Files ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Inequality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' grandparent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' health record ', ' Agreement ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Institution ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Data ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' data format ', ' public health research ', ' population health ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' data resource ', ' Infrastructure ', ' data dissemination ', ' data infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,522433,0.10694019790079831
"The Microvascular Aging and Eicosanoids - Women's Evaluation of Systemic Aging Tenacity (MAE-WEST) (""You are never too old to become younger!"") Specialized Center for Research Excellence (SCORE) Project Abstract – MAE-WEST SCORE Overall Women age differently than men across the lifespan, culminating in a female predominance in morbid chronic diseases such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and chronic kidney disease. Women also tend to develop multi-organ syndromes (heart-brain, heart-kidney) more frequently than men. The mechanisms underlying sex-specific differences in multi-organ dysfunction remain poorly understood. Prior work indicates that women exhibit accelerated microvascular aging, a process implicated in disorders of the heart, brain, and kidney. In this context, systemic inflammation has emerged as a primary driver of both microvascular dysfunction and the development of these chronic disease states. Preliminary data from our group indicates that eicosanoids, a diverse group of bioactive lipids that serve as the upstream mediators of systemic inflammation, can influence endothelial cell function, exhibit sexual dimorphism in circulating plasma, and are related to certain vascular phenotypes. Given these findings, we hypothesize that sexual dimorphism in both local and systemic eicosanoid variation contributes to sex differences in microvascular dysfunction and, in turn, to sex differences in age-related multi-organ disease. Motivated by our early findings and the critical need to understand the determinants and drivers of sex differences in age-related disease outcomes, we propose to create the Microvascular Aging and Eicosanoids –Women’s Evaluation of Systemic aging Tenacity (MAE-WEST) Specialized Center of Research Excellence (SCORE) on Sex Differences. Leveraging our collective expertise, we plan to advance the understanding of sex-specific molecular drivers of chronic microvascular and end-organ disease through 3 foundational projects. In Project 1, we will examine longitudinal variation in circulating eicosanoid levels in relation to age-related alterations in microvascular function in end-organ (cardiovascular, neurocognitive, renal) disease traits in 2 large community cohorts. In Project 2, we will prospectively enroll and deeply phenotype a cohort of women and men to assess the relation of eicosanoids with organ-specific as well as global burden of microvascular disease, as well as their response to a trial of intensive medical therapy with FDA-approved agents (statins and ACEi/ARB). Finally, in Project 3, we will study the mechanistic role of sex-specific eicosanoid signaling on human endothelial cell function and on microvascular function in experimental models of organ-specific disease as well as whole organism aging. As an integral part of this SCORE, we will establish a Career Enhancement Center that will provide robust training and mentorship for trainees and junior investigators. Collectively, this highly collaborative and innovative SCORE aims to transform our understanding of sex differences in microvascular and chronic multi-organ diseases and, in turn, enable effective interventions through inter-disciplinary science, education, and advocacy. ! Project Narrative – MAE-WEST SCORE Overall Women compared to men experience an excess of burden of age-related diseases of the heart, brain, and kidney for reasons that remain unclear. Growing evidence points to the potential importance of chronic inflammation and small blood vessel dysfunction as key determinants of the sex differences seen in age-related disease outcomes. Therefore, we will establish a Specialized Center of Research Excellence focused on comprehensively investigating sex differences in the molecular drivers of chronic inflammation, microvascular aging, and end-organ disease. !","The Microvascular Aging and Eicosanoids - Women's Evaluation of Systemic Aging Tenacity (MAE-WEST) (""You are never too old to become younger!"")

"Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) Project Summary/Abstract The Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) is designed to increase both the number and diversity of investigators with the capacity to conduct independent research related to minority aging and health disparities. We are a research-based, mentoring partnership of four academic institutions: The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Morehouse School of Medicine, Tuskegee University, and The University of Alabama, working together to recruit minority investigators, provide education in aging and health disparities research, guide career development through collaborative mentoring, and sustain progress to successful, independent research careers. The research focus of the Deep South RCMAR is on reducing health disparities between African American (AA) and White older adults in the Deep South, the region of the country where the majority of older AAs live and health disparities have been particularly persistent. We focus on health problems particularly prevalent among older AAs in our region and for which disparities have been identified in both rural and urban settings. Our specific aims are to: (1) identify, engage, and mentor outstanding faculty under-represented in academia who are committed to academic careers in aging and health disparities research; (2) provide high quality research education and individualized career development support; (3) support innovative, high impact pilot projects that will advance the science of minority aging and health disparities; (4) provide expertise and resources for working collaboratively with communities in areas of interest to them and in the recruitment and retention of older AAs in research; (5) provide expertise and resources for study design, culturally sensitive measurement, data analysis, and access to databases for secondary analysis; and (6) disseminate to scientific, professional and lay audiences research results addressing the reduction of health disparities through the improvement of minority health, particularly for older AAs. We propose continuation and enhancements of the cores established during the first two funding cycles: the Research Education Component (formerly the Investigator Development Core), the Administrative Core, the Analysis Core, and the Community Liaison and Recruitment Core. Over the next five years, we will fund at least 15 pilot projects; provide research education through our inter-disciplinary Health Disparities Research Education Program; and assist RCMAR Scientists to obtain career development or independent research grants. With renewal of the Deep South RCMAR, we also propose innovations in each core to enhance our overall program effectiveness in recruiting minority investigators, providing education in aging and heath disparities research, guiding career development through collaborative mentoring, and sustaining their progress to successful, independent research careers. In these ways, the RCMAR will enhance the size and diversity of the scientific workforce advancing the science of minority aging and health disparities in the Deep South.

"Origin of Chronic Diseases of Aging Among Rural African American Young Adults PROJECT SUMMARY  The current proposal builds upon an ongoing investigation to test hypotheses about (1) the role of psychosocial stressors in “weathering” young bodies, (2) the protective factors that may mitigate their adverse impact, and (3) the role of continuity and change in weathering during a key life course transition. Tests of these hypotheses will enable a better understanding of the role of weathering in forecasting chronic diseases of aging (CDAs) among rural African Americans and set the stage for prevention programming for this vulnerable population. Using recently-developed, direct measures of biological weathering we have found that, by age 20, some SHAPE youth are already experiencing accelerated aging due to psychosocial context. The transition to adulthood provides an opportunity to examine the impact of both new and continuing sources of risk and resilience on weathering and ultimately on CDA vulnerability during this important transition period, allowing us to closely examine the potential for adverse and protective experiences to “bend” the risk curve for future CDAs and so illuminate key targets for preventive intervention. Here, we request funds to supplement the SHAPE study by using blood from an ongoing NICHD-sponsored data collection protocol to characterize each participant's “epigenetic clock” at age 26, providing a key window on weathering and changes in weathering and so allow us to conduct enhanced tests of theory and to more accurately identify high value targets for preventive intervention. By adding this assessment we will have a data set with measures of biological weathering at age 20 and age 26, along with a full complement of indicators of metabolic syndrome, a precursor to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This assessment will place no additional burden on SHAPE participants and will substantially increase the public health value of the data set. First, we will examine the impact of exposure to multidimensional SES- and race-related stressors during the transition to adulthood on changes in biological weathering. We expect exposure to stressors, particularly racial discrimination, to play a key role in maintaining or accelerating weathering processes across young adulthood and to presage CDA vulnerability (i.e. metabolic risk and inflammation). Second, we will identify positive, protective influences, both inside and outside the family, that help shift African American young adults off the above-mentioned trajectory to CDAs. We anticipate that these factors will be especially important for young adults who enter the transition to adulthood with already-accelerated weathering. The results of the proposed study will inform the development of preventive interventions designed to slow biological weathering and promote health for a population at high risk for early development of CDAs. By examining not only risk factors for accelerated aging but also protective environments and coping processes that presage a deceleration of biological aging across young adulthood, we will have the necessary ingredients for a new generation of prevention programs designed specifically to deter weathering and promote the health and well-being of rural African Americans, thereby addressing well-documented health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans coping with the challenges of rural Southern environments experience accelerated biological aging that contributes to earlier onset of chronic diseases, like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Understanding and preventing the emergence of these disparities during key transitions, like the transition to adulthood, requires attention to both change and continuity. By adding a second assessment of a key construct, the data provided by the current study will allow examination of change and continuity in biological aging, informing the development of prevention programs designed to deter accelerated biological aging and ultimately chronic diseases.",Origin of Chronic Diseases of Aging Among Rural African American Young Adults,9925262,R01HD091046,"['Acceleration ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronology ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Collection ', ' Deceleration ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Life Experience ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Triglycerides ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Biological Aging ', ' Mediating ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' race discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' heuristics ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' early onset ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' stem ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' racial identity ', ' rural African American ', ' protective factors ', ' social relationships ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2020,168182,0.0779393631556052

"Mechanisms of Disparities in Adverse Neurocognitive Outcomes among Hispanics Aging with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY The adverse consequences of HIV and related comorbidities on the central nervous system remain prevalent despite highly effective antiretroviral therapy, with approximately 40% of persons living with HIV showing neurocognitive impairment (NCI). Compared to other ethnic/racial groups in the United States, HIV infected (HIV+) Hispanics/Latinos/as, hereafter referred to as Hispanics, present with increased risk for NCI and neurocognitive decline; and this risk is particularly pronounced in older age. Yet, the factors underlying these disparities are not well understood. Guided by the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework, the present proposal aims to identify key mechanisms underlying adverse neurocognitive outcomes among Hispanics aging with HIV. Among the potential predictors of NCI in this group, the proposed study will focus on two biological processes -- metabolic syndrome and gut microbiome dysbiosis -- that may be particularly problematic among Hispanics and may result in greater brain vulnerability to HIV. The study will also integrate aspects of the physical/built and sociocultural environment (assessed via geocoding) that have been linked to metabolic syndrome and NCI, and investigate their influence on neurocognitive disparities in HIV. We will also explore the impact of behavioral (physical activity and diet) and healthcare (healthcare use and access, health literacy) variables. We will collect these data in 200 HIV+ and HIV-uninfected Hispanics (approximately half Spanish-speaking) aged 40 and over, and investigate their impact on neurocognitive status cross-sectionally and longitudinally over the course of three years. We will leverage existing longitudinal data from the UCSD HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program to select a comparison group of 100 HIV+ non-Hispanic Whites. To ensure the success of the proposed multidisciplinary approach, we have assembled a research team representing an integration of relevant disciplines, including cross-cultural neuropsychology, health disparities, medicine, public health, microbiomics, geography, and bioinformatics, and information systems. Recognizing the importance of a community-based participatory research approach in the study of health disparities, we have partnered with community clinics and stakeholders whose input has helped strengthen our approach and assure its relevance to the community. We will build on existing cross-sectional studies in Hispanics led by the PI for recruitment of participants into the proposed study, and our community partnerships will help assure that we reach the most vulnerable segments of the Hispanic community. With this multidisciplinary and community integrated approach to research, we aim to increase our understanding of the complexity that underlies mechanisms of disparities in neurocognitive outcomes among diverse groups of Hispanics aging with HIV. Such knowledge is crucial for the development of targeted, culturally relevant interventions to prevent or ameliorate HIV-associated NCI among Hispanics and reduce health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed observational longitudinal study aims to determine important mechanisms underlying disparities in neurocognitive outcomes among Hispanics aging with HIV. This is an important public health priority because: 1) the adverse impact of HIV and related comorbidities in the central nervous system are still prevalent and impactful; and 2) HIV-infected Hispanics are at higher risk for neurocognitive impairment, and this disparity is expected to increase with the aging of the HIV-infected population.

"Center for Aging in Diverse Communities: Ending Health Inequities in Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC), an NIA- funded RCMAR since 1997, conducts research, training, and mentoring in minority aging and health disparities research. CADC offers a rich, multidisciplinary environment with social, behavioral, epidemiological, cognitive neuroscience, statistical, and internal medicine faculty providing mentoring and training support. The San Francisco Bay Area provides access to a wide range of diverse racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and sexual and gender minority older adult populations. Our on-going studies with diverse rural and urban communities and solid relationships with over 100 community and clinical partners serving older adult disparity populations provide applied laboratories for mentoring. Our research theme addresses two NIA priorities: (1) understanding mechanisms of health disparities and developing effective interventions to reduce them; and (2) to develop infrastructure for high quality research. Since 1997, CADC has mentored over 90 minority underrepresented early investigators who have made significant contributions to minority aging research. In the past 5-year funding cycle, we mentored 25 minority early investigators and funded 26 pilot projects. Our cores will continue within the new RCMAR organizational framework. The Administrative Core (AC) will coordinate integration of the cores, selection of CADC Scientists, reporting, and external advisors. The Research & Education Component (REC) will provide continual mentorship and pilot study funding for CADC Scientists. The Analysis Core (AnC) will advance and disseminate methodological resources and measures for minority aging and health disparities research. The Community Liaison & Recruitment Core (CLRC) will enhance recruitment and retention and promote engagement of diverse communities in research. Our CADC cores contribute jointly and uniquely to mentoring and training CADC Scientists and others in conducting research to resolve the challenging issues facing our older adult disparity populations. CADC's aims are to: (1) select 3-4 CADC Scientists (underrepresented junior investigators) per year, provide them with pilot study funding, and mentor them to develop independent research careers in health disparities and minority aging research; (2) develop and disseminate (a) methods for conducting interventions to ameliorate disparities among older adults, (b) methods for developing/selecting measures appropriate for disparity populations, and (c) methodological resources on advanced research and statistical methods; and (3) advance the science of community engagement and recruitment to increase participation of disparity populations in research, and mentor CADC Scientists on these methods. CADC will contribute to diversifying the workforce by promoting the expertise and careers of exceptionally talented underrepresented CADC Scientists to develop independent research careers. The cumulative experience, commitment to health equity, and professional networks of CADC Faculty and Scientists in the research and local communities ensures that we will achieve these aims. NARRATIVE For 20 years, the UCSF Center for Aging in Diverse Communities (CADC) has been dedicated to eliminating health disparities in minority aging populations. Our research focuses on understanding health disparities and building and testing community-engaged interventions to reduce disparities among older adults. Our most important mission is to train and mentor talented, underrepresented junior investigators to develop independent research careers focused on health disparities and aging issues. Our mentoring is informed and optimized by our research, community partnerships, diverse local populations, and decades of mentoring experience.",Center for Aging in Diverse Communities: Ending Health Inequities in Older Adults,9978554,P30AG015272,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' California ', ' Capsicum ', ' pepper ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Laboratories ', ' Locales ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' effective intervention ', ' health equity ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' career fair ', ' professional networking ', ' speed networking ', ' career networking ', ' community building ', ' faculty community ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' community clinic ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",P30,2020,1050120,0.03614622747317955
"Interdisciplinary Network on Rural Population Health and Aging Project Summary U.S. population aging is occurring more rapidly in rural than in urban areas, rural areas are home to disproportionate shares of older and sicker people, and rural-urban and within-rural disparities in health and mortality are growing. New approaches to researching rural health and aging are needed that recognize that rural America is not monolithic, it contains both resilient and vulnerable places, and its problems are multilevel and multidimensional. The Interdisciplinary Network on Rural Population Health and Aging (INRPHA) will forge new collaborations between scientists who study health and aging with others who focus on spatial disparities and rural well-being. We will bring together dynamic clusters of scientists and recruit emerging, established, and underrepresented researchers from multiple institutions across the U.S. to catalyze a new generation of research on rural U.S. population health and aging. We will leverage a well-established USDA-supported national consortium of researchers (W4001) that has been at the forefront of providing timely and policy-relevant evidence on demographic trends in rural America. In addition, health and aging researchers and the institutional assets within the proposed Network’s four lead universities – Penn State, Syracuse Univ., Univ. of Mississippi, and Univ. of Colorado, Boulder – constitute a pool of expertise poised to provide novel, interdisciplinary, and regionally- attuned understandings of social and spatial determinants of rural population health, health disparities, and aging. The project’s aims are to (1) develop an open and evolving network that draws participants from multiple regions, institutions, disciplines, career stages, and underrepresented groups; (2) design activities to generate innovative research by enhancing the collective capacity of Network members and supporting formative research through pilot grants, working groups, annual meetings, and training materials; and (3) conduct novel research to: a) understand the multilevel and multidimensional mechanisms driving rural-urban continuum and within-rural disparities in health and aging, b) detail the impacts of aging trends on rural communities, c) analyze the intersection of rural economic livelihoods, health, and aging, d) examine the impacts of physical and social isolation on cognitive health (including Alzheimer’s disease) and healthy aging in rural areas, and e) understand relationships between environmental hazards and climate change for rural older adults. We will also attend to intersections between race, rurality, and health and aging outcomes and how these relationships vary across regional, state, and local contexts. A final aim is to (4) disseminate data, analytic resources, and research findings to academic, policy, and public audiences through research briefs, webinars, data archiving, and other mechanisms. Through INRPHA’s activities, emphasis is placed on developing a sustainable foundation to support continued innovative, publicly-accessible, and impactful research on rural population health and aging. Project Narrative U.S. population aging is occurring more rapidly in rural than in urban areas, rural areas are home to disproportionate shares of older and sicker people, and rural-urban and within-rural disparities in health and life expectancy are growing. Through multiple mechanisms (pilot grants, working groups, annual meetings, mentoring activities, methods training), the proposed Network will bring together scientists with expertise in various health and aging outcomes (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, chronic diseases, behavioral health, mortality), social determinants of health, rural economies, population and environment, and policy, along with data and methods across multiple sources, levels, and dimensions of health and aging to study the multilevel and multidimensional exposures shaping and being shaped by health and aging trends among different rural populations and regions. The Network will disseminate findings to academic, policy, and public audiences through presentations, academic publications, public research briefs and webinars, and congressional briefings, and will develop and disseminate data and analytic resources and training materials to ensure sustained and powerful impact in the area of rural population health and aging.",Interdisciplinary Network on Rural Population Health and Aging,10021598,R24AG065159,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Colorado ', ' Data Sources ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' Science ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Generations ', ' Out-Migrations ', ' Rural Community ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' career ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' meetings ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Cognitive ', ' Community Practice ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' environmental change ', ' Social Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' resilience ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' healthy aging ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' operation ', ' webinar ', ' Data Analytics ', ' improved outcome ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' data library ', ' data archive ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' data resource ', ' rurality ', ' urban disparity ', ' rural America ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' rural setting ', ' recruit ', ' eMERGE Consortium ', ' eMERGE Network ', ' Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R24,2020,320830,0.13765699299231135
"USC Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (US-RCMAR) Overall Project Summary Advances in medicine and technology are providing for longer and healthier lives today much more than in the past. Yet with longevity comes new public health concerns about age-related diseases and conditions. Moreover, health indicators have demonstrated little improvement in health disparities between different racial and ethnic populations over the past decades. Indeed, many of the health and economics issues associated with the aging process are of such magnitude and complexity that they cannot be understood from the vantage point of any single discipline alone. Against this backdrop, the Minority Aging Health Economics Research Center (the University of Southern California Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research, “USC RCMAR”) brings together an interdisciplinary team to provide infrastructure and resources to increase the number, diversity and success of researchers focusing on the health and economic well being of the elderly with the goal of improving the health, well-being, function, and independence of all older Americans. We will build upon its successful 5 year history, during which it has supported 15 pilots and 92 papers involving 13 scientists at USC, 1 scientist at the Spelman College, 1 scientist at Vanderbilt University and 1 scientist at Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The mission of the Minority Aging Health Economics Research Center (the University of Southern California Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research, “USC RCMAR”) is to increase the diversity and success of researchers focusing on the health and economic well being of the elderly with the goal of improving the health, well-being, function, and independence of diverse older Americans. The proposed RCMAR’s target research areas are the differences across racial and ethnic groups of elderly in health and health care usage with an emphasis is on using longitudinal survey and claims based data sources to identify causal pathways: i.e. (1) social, economic and environmental factors driving disparities in physical disease and cognitive functioning; and (2) health consequences of disparities in medical care and pharmaceutical utilization. The USC RCMAR is housed in the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, which brings together 40 health policy experts across the University—including faculty from Gerontology, Engineering, Law, Public Policy, Pharmacy, Medicine, and Arts & Letters. This proposed Center will utilize the resources of National Institute on Aging Centers including Roybal Center for Health Policy Simulation, Roybal Institute on Aging, Roybal Center for Financial Decision Making and Financial Independence in Old Age, Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Center for the Study of Health Inequality, USC/UCLA Biodemography and Population Health; and other USC Centers including Brookings Institute/Schaeffer Initiative, USC Center for Economic and Social Research, and the Schaeffer Center.

"Racial and gender disparities in sleep as modifiable determinants of cognitive aging. PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this fellowship is to prepare the applicant, Afsara Zaheed, for an independent research career focused on the biopsychosocial determinants of cognitive aging in order to improve cognitive health among older adults and eliminate racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). To that end, the proposed fellowship consists of two complementary components: (1) a research project that will further our understanding of the role of sleep in late-life cognitive disparities, and (2) a training plan comprising formal training, mentorship, hands-on research, manuscript publications, clinical practica, and professional development activities. The applicant will be supported by a strong mentorship team with primary sponsors at the University of Michigan’s Departments of Psychology and Neurology and consultants from the UM Institute for Social Research and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Together, the mentorship team will provide expertise in cognitive aging, ADRD disparities, sleep, and the epidemiology of ADRD. The training program will help the applicant: a) develop expertise in determinants of brain-behavior relationships, focusing on racial disparities and the role of sleep on cognitive aging; b) develop strong methodological skills in epidemiological data collection and multivariate data analysis; and c) engage in the dissemination of research findings and networking within the broader sleep and cognitive aging research communities.  ADRD pose a significant public health concern, and the current lack of disease modifying treatment calls for the identification of potentially modifiable risk and protective factors to promote healthy cognitive aging. The presence of sleep disturbances in late-life have been identified as a salient risk factor for cognitive impairments, and epidemiological research has shown that certain racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately burdened by both sleep disturbances and ADRD. However, little is known about how disparities in sleep relate to disparities in late-life cognition. Thus, the proposed project will examine: 1) whether sleep disturbances mediate the effects of race on late-life cognition; 2) whether associations among race, sleep, and cognition are modified by sex/gender; and 3) whether patterns of associations are robust across multiple datasets. All aims will be investigated in the Michigan Study of Cognitive Aging in Diverse Elders (MSCADE, a regional cohort study of non-Hispanic black and white older adults in Southeastern Michigan) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, a national cohort study of older adults in the US).  The proposed research directly addresses Goals D and F of the NIA Strategic Directions for Research on Aging, which calls for more research on 1) the influence of contexts on older adults’ cognitive functioning and mechanisms involved in brain aging (including the role of sleep); and 2) understanding health disparities among older adults. Our findings will have the potential to promote healthy cognitive aging and reduce racial disparities in ADRD by identifying sleep as a potentially modifiable target for intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Characterizing mechanisms that create and sustain racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is of critical importance to the diverse, aging population of the U.S. The proposed project will be the first to examine whether sleep mediates the effect of race on multiple domains of cognition, and whether associations among race, sleep, and cognition are modified by sex/gender. Results could have implications for more targeted interventions aimed at preventing or delaying age-related cognitive decline and racial disparities in ADRD.",Racial and gender disparities in sleep as

"ACL-LIFE Life History Interview and Validation To understand the social determinants of health and address persistent disparities in healthy aging, researchers and policymakers have increasingly taken a life course view of social exposures. Conditions of early and midlife are implicated in empirical studies of later life health and health disparities by gender, race and ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. A better understanding of the long-term influences of complex and time-varying health, socioeconomic, psychosocial and environmental exposures is essential for evaluating theories of the life course, cumulative advantage and health disparities, and for designing interventions to foster healthy aging for all. Key methodological advances in the collection of retrospective life history (RLH) data have enabled major ongoing longitudinal studies of aging, including the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), the Survey of Health and Ageing in Europe (SHARE), and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), to fill in life course gaps quickly and cost-effectively by collecting information using the event history calendar approach. The data from RLH interviews can be used to generate measures of schooling, relationship, parenting, employment, financial and residential histories; life events like health shocks; presence and quality of social network relationships; and behaviors like tobacco use or health care utilization. However, the reliability of RLH interview data has not been comprehensively evaluated against the survey “gold standard” of prospectively-collected information. The few assessments of RLH data quality have focused on different domains of the life course, but each has revealed evidence of recall error (especially by duration since event and complexity of reporting task) and recall bias (especially by age, gender and sometimes race and education), though findings remain mixed and incomplete. We propose to build on the existing prospective Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) study, a multi-racial, nationally-representative cohort study that has collected measures from across major life domains and of aging-related morbidities over the adult lifespan. The ACL-6 wave is currently in the field, and will provide 33 years of exposure measures. We will field a RLH interview similar to the one used by SHARE (ACL-LIFE) and conduct an innovative, integrated set of analyses to more comprehensively examine the prevalence, dimensions, and sociodemographic determinants of mismatch between retrospectively- and prospectively-collected life history information than has been possible to date. We will also explore whether and how reliance on RLH data could influence conclusions about healthy aging or health disparities drawn from analyses using life course exposures as predictors. These novel assessments will inform research on survey methodology and enhance the value of major ongoing longitudinal studies of aging. They will also provide critical findings for researchers and policy makers reliant on cost- effective and timely information about life course exposures that can be used to improve the lives of all adults, and to eliminate disparities in healthy aging. This project evaluates mismatch in life history data collected retrospectively versus prospectively, using the American's Changing Lives (ACL) Study - a nationally-representative, three-decade panel of adults. The study contributes to two overarching goals of the Public Health Service: increasing healthy active life expectancy and reducing social disparities in health.",ACL-LIFE Life History Interview and Validation,9861620,R01AG065319,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Europe ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Parents ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Survivors ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fostering ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Respondent ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' life history ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Subgroup ', ' Calendar ', ' Collection ', ' investigator training ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' social disparities ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' healthy aging ', ' social health determinants ', ' gender disparity ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographic predictors ', ' sociodemographic predictors ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,580829,0.09584953332298203
"A Longitudinal Study of Endocrine Disruptor Mixtures and Reproductive Aging Project Summary/Abstract Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is widespread and these compounds can persist in the environment and the human body over decades. The population is aging, and women, in particular, can experience significant morbidity and diminished quality of life with aging. Recent epidemiologic data suggest that the timing of reproductive aging (the gradual decline in ovarian function with age) and the pattern of hormonal change during the menopausal transition influence women’s risk of chronic disease and their long- term health with aging. While numerous studies have examined adverse reproductive health effects and exposure to EDCs, little is known about how EDCs affect the timing or process of reproductive aging. Further, most existing epidemiologic studies on this topic have been cross-sectional with studies of age-at-menopause based on recall, limiting causal inference. In addition, combined exposure to various EDCs and pollutant- pollutant interactions (mixtures), as well as low-dose and non-monotonic dose-responses have been rarely if at all addressed. The proposed new epidemiologic study in a multi-ethnic cohort of women seeks to better understand how EDCs exposure affects the timing and characteristics of reproductive aging. We propose 1) to assess associations between EDC exposure (polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated pesticides, brominated flame retardants, and perfluorinated compounds) and timing of reproductive aging, including age at menopause and duration of the menopausal transition; 2) to assess the association between EDC exposure and hormonal characteristics during the menopausal transition, including levels and patterns of change in estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, testosterone, sex-hormone binding globulin, and anti-Müllerian hormone; and 3) to examine the simultaneous effects of multiple EDCs and their interactions (mixture effects) on these reproductive aging outcomes using regression methods for high-dimensional covariates (multi-pollutant approaches). We will also explore effect modification by race/ethnicity and temporal variations in EDCs. We will capitalize on extensive phenotypic data and biospecimens collected for more than 15 years in an ongoing, large longitudinal cohort of women, the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (n=1,800 with a total of ~14,000 observations). This project addresses strategic priorities of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, including disease pathogenesis by combined environmental exposures, as well as environmental health disparities. We will address these issues using innovative analytic approaches likely to yield new insights on the study of pollution mixtures and human health. The knowledge gained from this research may guide disease prevention initiatives; enhance women’s health and wellbeing as they age; and reduce environmental health disparities. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because comprehensive evaluation of the impact of multiple EDCs on reproductive aging will further our understanding of how complex exposures to EDCs may accelerate, delay or disrupt reproductive aging during this critical life stage. Such information would help inform the critical timing of interventions to effectively prevent or reduce the risk of chronic diseases and premature mortality. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIEHS’s mission that discovers how EDC exposures affect women’s health with aging in order to promote healthy aging.",A Longitudinal Study of Endocrine Disruptor Mixtures and Reproductive Aging,9731469,R01ES026964,"['death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' socio-demographic factors ', ' sociodemographic factors ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estraldine ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Progynon ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fecundity ', ' Flame Retardants ', ' Fire Retardants ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Japanese ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Menopause ', ' Premature Menopause ', ' early menopause ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Understanding the Aging Process of Urban African Americans Across the Life Course: Identifying Early Risk and Protection for Cognition and Health in Midlife PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Black Americans experience disproportionate poor aging outcomes, including pronounced disparities in brain health (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease), significant social isolation, and nearly twice the mortality rate compared to Whites. Although it is purported that these adverse health outcomes are due to a combination of greater adversity over the life course and unhealthy coping behaviors, few studies have prospectively examined these aspects of the lives of Blacks from childhood into the 60s. This developmental epidemiological study focuses on life course pathways to successful aging in a large community cohort of urban Blacks first studied at age 6, then in adolescence, and at ages 32 and 42. The proposed fifth round of data collection at age 60 is crucial for examining individual and contextual life course trajectories affecting the aging experience. The specific aims are to: (1) identify the array of aging experiences for the Woodlawn cohort of Blacks at age 60 using indicators of cognitive, physical, functional, social, and mental health, (2) determine specific stressors across the life course that influence aging, and (3) identify specific and malleable protective factors across the life course that promote physical, mental, cognitive and social well-being for urban Blacks. This comprehensive study has followed nearly all children entering first grade in 1966 in Woodlawn, a poor Chicago community (N=1242). We have collected information from mothers, teachers, and official school, criminal, and death records as well as data from cohort members themselves and now have an invaluable opportunity to examine well being comprehensively over the life course for an underinvestigated population. This one-of-a-kind study spanning more than 50 years will allow in-depth exploration of both normative development and deviance, challenging assumptions of Black homogeneity and reframing the current deficit conceptualization, to focus instead on pathways to successful aging, cognitive functioning, and health. Guided by the life course perspective and stress theory, the experienced, uniquely qualified research team will employ advanced locating technology and sophisticated analytical approaches tailored to longitudinal research. This research will contribute to understanding life course influences on aging in urban Blacks. Our long-term goal is to inform intervention development and policy making by identifying critical pivotal influences along the life course that alter aging trajectories and improve health outcomes. In addition, this study will produce a dataset that can be used by us and others for many years to identify complex patterns, subgroup differences, indirect pathways and targets for early intervention that are critical to reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes for at-risk urban Blacks. This work aligns with NIA’s strategic direction, which aims to (1) better understand the effects of personal, interpersonal, and societal factors on later life cognitive impairment (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease, Dementia) and aging, (2) understand health disparities, and (3) develop strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Black Americans experience disproportionately poorer health and higher mortality throughout the life course, disparities of great public health significance. Little is understood about factors that promote successful aging among urban Blacks. This research, which will now span over 50 years, will make unique and important contributions to our understanding of life course influences on aging, cognition, and health among Black Americans, with specific focus on multiple levels of influence, and will inform intervention development and policy by identifying life course risk factors for poor outcomes, as well as pivotal points of influence along the life course that alter risk trajectories.",Understanding the Aging Process of Urban African Americans Across the Life Course: Identifying Early Risk and Protection for Cognition

"Engagement in Longevity and Medicine (ELM) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to establish a centralized research infrastructure that harnesses New York University (NYU) Langone Health’s clinical and community partnerships throughout New York City to strengthen and advance the science of community engagement, recruitment and retention in aging and Alzheimer’s and related dementia (ADRD) research. Despite the tremendous growth in the older adult and elderly population, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities, these individuals are underrepresented in clinical research. Older age participants face challenges that differ from younger age populations in engagement, recruitment and retention in human subjects research. These include concerns about chronic disease complexities, mobility limitations, and cognitive and sensory impairments that may limit access to research opportunities or capacity to consent. As a result, the evidence of what works in healthcare interventions is less generalizable to older populations, particularly for minority and low-income communities despite the recognition of the disproportionate burden of health disparities among these communities. To address these concerns, the NYU Engagement in Longevity and Medicine (ELM) Research Collaborative will evaluate and disseminate best practices in engaging, recruiting and retaining older populations, stimulate the development and testing of innovative community-engaged and technology-based approaches to participant recruitment in clinical and community settings, and strengthen communication and messaging strategies tailored to diverse aging research populations that are inclusive of ADRD communities and representative of the National Institute on Aging’s priority populations. To increase engagement, recruitment, and retention of older age subjects into aging and ADRD research, the NYU ELM Research Collaborative will: 1) establish a centralized infrastructure including community members, clinical researchers, and patient and family stakeholders in aging and ADRD research; 2) analyze and evaluate what is currently known about successful strategies and challenges in recruitment and retention; 3) develop innovative approaches for education and engagement using electronic health record systems and community navigators rooted in the community health worker model; 4) build and deploy a novel training program for research teams using simulation with actors as potential subjects; and 5) develop a broad-based research registry of interested potential subjects reflective of the diversity of the older adult US population. This study will provide immediate benefit to ongoing aging and ADRD clinical trials and substantial support to future trials.

"Psychosocial Context and the Biological Clock: Changes in Weathering during Middle-Age PROJECT SUMMARY  Unprecedented growth in the proportion of older adults in the U.S. has placed inequalities in healthy aging at the forefront of the public health agenda. Individuals often differ dramatically in their speed of aging. Some demonstrate accelerated aging and suffer early onset of chronic illness whereas others manifest decelerated aging and stave off serious illness well into their 90s. In recent years, researchers have made much headway in understanding the molecular markers of healthy aging, thereby allowing for earlier identification of risk for chronic disease. The proposed research focuses on two such biomarkers of healthy aging – inflammatory aging and methylomic aging. These measures provide us with “biological clocks” that are strongly predictive of age-related physiological decline, disease, and mortality. Having established these molecular measures of the speed of aging, the important question for social scientists and health policy now becomes: To what extent is the speed of aging malleable, for better or worse, in response to natural shifts in psychosocial contexts? This question is the focus of the present proposal. We plan to investigate the extent to which adult social conditions from various domains, but especially those operating within the family, influence speed of biological aging after taking into account childhood experiences and potentially confounding life style factors such as diet, exercise, and smoking. Our objective is to identify the stressors that accelerate aging as well as the supports that decelerate aging. These goals will be pursued using longitudinal data from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS), a 20-year study of well-being among African American mothers, their romantic partners (RPs), and their offspring. A focus on aging among African Americans is important as they tend to suffer from earlier onset and higher prevalence of age-related diseases and a wider range of psychosocial stressors than other ethnic groups. First, we will obtain longitudinal indices of the speed of inflammatory and methylomic aging from the now middle-aged mothers and, if partnered, their RPs by collecting and assaying a new wave of blood data, as well as assaying stored blood from a previous wave. The proposed data will provide the first comprehensive assessment of change in the speed or rate of biological aging during adulthood. Second, we will collect an additional wave of interview data so that changes in supports and stressors can be mapped onto changes in the rate of biological aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Improving the quality of longer lives requires better specified models of healthy aging. Our objective is to identify the stressors that accelerate as well as the supports that decelerate the rate of biological aging.

"Cultivating Health & Aging Researchers by Integrating Science, Medicine & Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The population of older adults in the United States is the largest and most racially and ethnically diverse the nation has ever known, and these trends are expected to continue or accelerate. To meet the increased healthcare needs of a diverse older adult population, it is important that the healthcare workforce represent the diversity of this population. A diverse healthcare workforce is important to expand healthcare access for underserved populations and to enrich the pool of leaders and policymakers with unique insights into and familiarity with the diverse healthcare needs of our aging population. This is especially true for clinical research, since researchers often rely on personal experience as they formulate and seek to answer research questions. Thus, broader representation of underrepresented minority leaders in the clinical research workforce can help ensure that research priorities appropriately address the needs of older minority groups.  Despite the recognized need for a diverse clinical research workforce, students from underrepresented groups face significant barriers to pursuing training in clinical research for older adults. Students from underrepresented groups encounter financial, informational and cultural challenges that limit their interest and participation in medicine overall. Moreover, students from underrepresented groups may be less likely to pursue training in clinical research for older adults if they do not perceive such research as relevant to their lives.  The University of Chicago (UC) is a leader in training future clinical researchers from underrepresented backgrounds, with a specific focus on aging through several NIA research training programs designed for students at different training levels. These training programs expose students to formal didactic curricula in aging and clinical research, multi-tiered mentorship teams that conduct clinical research in aging, and realistic career experiences in clinical research and aging. Our NIGMS-funded pipeline program for underrepresented Chicago public high school students has successfully increased the interest and intent in pursuing a career clinical research. Our NIA programs for medical students have successfully improved interest in aging research careers and research productivity of those trainees (i.e., publications and awards).  Building on the success of our programs for diverse high school and medical students, we will leverage our experience training learners in aging research to build the Cultivating Health & Aging Researchers by Integrating Science, Medicine & Aging (CHARISMA) program, a structured longitudinal multi-tiered mentored aging-related research training program for undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds. The objectives of CHARISMA are 1) to prepare undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds for medicine, science, engineering, technology and mathematics (MSTEM) careers in aging-related clinical research, and 2) to increase and sustain learner satisfaction, aging-related research knowledge, attitudes toward aging-related clinical research careers, and behaviors associated with pursuing an aging-related research career in an MSTEM field among underrepresented undergraduates. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Cultivating Health & Aging Researchers by Integrating Science, Medicine & Aging (CHARISMA) program is a structured longitudinal multi-tiered mentored aging-related research training program for undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds. CHARISMA aims to train underrepresented undergraduate students for an MSTEM career in aging-related clinical research through: 1) a didactic curriculum structured to generate interest in and the provision of knowledge necessary to pursue an MSTEM career in aging-related research, 2) exposure to a multi-tiered structure of mentorship that enables identification of multi-level aging-related clinical research role models that can facilitate career choice, 3) participation in realistic career activities that actively challenge and engage students to develop attitudes and behaviors relevant for aging-related clinical research.","Cultivating Health & Aging Researchers by Integrating Science, Medicine & Aging",9979721,R25AG060910,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Career Choice ', ' Career Path ', ' career aspiration ', ' career interest ', ' career pathway ', ' career track ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Encounter Groups ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Health ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Patients ', ' Productivity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' satisfaction ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Familiarity ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' Older Population ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' interactive curriculum ', ' Curriculum Management System ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' didactic curriculum ', ' didactic education ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' High School Student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' faculty mentor ', ' matriculation ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R25,2020,341248,0.07629913236265398
"Contextual and Health Behavior Effects on Epigenetic Aging Among African Americans ABSTRACT: Considerable evidence exists linking early stress to accelerated aging, but potential mechanisms (mediators) accounting for this effect are poorly understood. Likewise, the impact of continuing stress in young adulthood on accelerated aging is largely unknown. Compounding the lack of information regarding mechanisms and timing of effects, available research is limited because it has focused mostly on White samples -- in spite of the fact that Blacks have significantly higher rates than other racial/ethnic groups of almost every type of chronic illness, as well as most markers of inflammation, and epigenetic aging (epi-A) —i.e., the difference between chronological age, and biological age, based on epigenetic changes in DNA methylation. The proposed research is designed to examine: a) factors that affect accelerated aging in Blacks, especially economic and race- related stress; and b) the role of mediators and moderators that may be useful targets for preventive interventions, such as substance use and poor diet, and also protective factors.  A focus of the current investigation is testing alternative pathways to accelerated aging attributable to early and later stressors. One pathway focuses on stressor effects on potentially unhealthy behavior (e.g., substance use, diet) that may, in turn, give rise to chronic diseases of aging. This possibility is supported by evidence that stressful life events, especially those linked to discrimination, predict life style choices. Conversely, stress effects may also accelerate aging by altering functioning of the glucocorticoid system. Or, the two pathways may be interrelated. In addition, we focus on expanding what is known about the range of stressors within a given developmental period that are most critical, and the extent to which protective factors affect epi-A. Addressing an important limitation of prior research, we will have reliable, sensitive biomarkers of smoking, marijuana, alcohol use, and diet available at two time points as well as census track and parent report indices of stressors at multiple time points, allowing and us to supplement self-report measures and examine models more rigorously and with greater precision than has previously been possible.  The proposed research will focus on 470 young adults who are part of a larger (N=889) panel study of Black families, the Family and Community Health Study. FACHS has followed a cohort of “target” participants from ages 10 to 28, along with their parents and family members. By characterizing methylation using the Illumina Epic array for two time points in young adulthood (28 and 33), we will be able to determine change in epi-A; i.e., the extent to which accelerated aging continues to be malleable in young adulthood. Using existing self- and parental reports of a variety of stressors-- from 8 waves of data, along with well-validated epigenetic biomarkers of epi-A, smoking, and drinking, we will be able to leverage the exceedingly rich existing prospective FACHS dataset, including its information on stress, protective factors, substance use, and coping, with the goal of informing preventive intervention research that can address the sources of disparities in healthy aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE As the public impact of age-related diseases has grown over time, it has become apparent that improving the quality of longer lives requires further exploration of the causes of accelerated epigenetic aging (epi-A), which forecasts heightened risk for all-cause morbidity and mortality. This proposal seeks funding to conduct new assays on existing blood samples from members of the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS), and to collect another wave of blood from these individuals, in order to assess the impact of various stressors and supports on epi-A (at age 28) and changes in epi-A from age 28 to age 33.",Contextual and Health Behavior Effects on Epigenetic Aging Among African Americans,9986706,R01CA220254,"['Acceleration ', ' Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' Censuses ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronology ', ' Communities ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Translations ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' heuristics ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' drinking ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Cytokine Gene ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' prospective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' healthy aging ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Family and Community Health Study ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' global methylation ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' THC co-use ', ' THC use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol co-use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol use ', ' cannabis use ', ' marijuana use ', ' primary care giver ', ' primary caregiver ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' protective factors ', ' early life stress ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,796841,0.06349016368544029
"Researching Epigenetics, Weathering, Aging & Residential Disadvantage (REWARD) PROJECT SUMMARY Both African Americans living in segregated socioeconomically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods and resource-poor residents of rural areas experience high rates of premature mortality and a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other adverse health conditions. Explaining how varied experiences of material and social disadvantage become embodied and subsequently manifest in racial and geographic health disparities is the key challenge for research, policy, and practice. While persistent social disadvantage is known to shape health disparities, the biological mechanisms that underlie this process – known as weathering – remain to be elucidated. The recent discovery of differential rates of biological aging (measured using DNA methylation) across subpopulations facing early life disadvantage suggest that the epigenome may play a key role in weathering. Epigenetic markers have also been linked with known disparities in multiple chronic conditions. The Researching Epigenetics, Weathering, Aging & Residential Disadvantage (REWARD) study will advance our understanding of DNA methylation as one epigenetic mechanism linking social, economic, and geographic disadvantage with accelerated aging and phenotypes of inflammation and cardio-metabolic diseases. Our goal is to determine how different dimensions of disadvantage – including individual characteristics (e.g. racial identification, socioeconomic status, and associated experiences of discrimination), and neighborhood-level contextual characteristics (e.g. concentrated poverty, racial segregation, and rural isolation) – shape health disparities through epigenetic mechanisms. We hypothesize that early-life and cumulative personal and contextual disadvantage predict DNA methylation patterns, creating biological signatures of weathering that contribute to accelerated biological aging, inflammation, and cardiometabolic disease in vulnerable populations. Few studies possess the temporal range of follow-up, geographic diversity, and extremes in racial segregation and rural isolation needed to test the hypothesis that individual and neighborhood-level disadvantage across the life course contribute to biological signatures of adversity. REWARD fills these gaps using rich data from an ongoing population based cohort in Wisconsin -- a state known for stark disparities including urban racial segregation and rural isolation. Using the 850K Infinium EPIC Chip array, we will analyze whole blood DNA and serum from 1400 participants in the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW), an ongoing, well-characterized, population-based cohort of Wisconsin adults. The diverse team includes scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s School of Medicine and Public Health and Department of Sociology, as well as a leading biological anthropologist from Northwestern University and the UCLA-based geneticist and biostatistician who developed the Horvath epigenetic clock. The REWARD Study’s unique combination of genetic, socio-demographic, behavioral, and neighborhood-level data will allow our multidisciplinary research team to provide new insights by (Aim 1) examining differences in DNA methylation signatures across multiple domains of disadvantage; (Aim 2) investigating the epigenetic mechanisms linking accelerated biological aging with functional gene expression, inflammation, and cardio-metabolic disease; and (Aim 3) characterizing the impact of disadvantage across the life course on longitudinal changes in epigenetic markers of aging and disease. Findings from this research will highlight the variability in human biological response to adversity and inform interventions to prevent and treat age-related disease, reduce and mitigate health disparities, and improve the health of aging populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite healthcare advances, racial and geographic disparities in life expectancy and complex chronic diseases persist. The REWARD Study aims to transform our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying disparities in mortality and chronic health conditions. It focuses on characterizing patterns of DNA methylation, a key epigenetic mechanism that influences gene expression during development and throughout life in response to environmental and social conditions. Specifically, it examines whether and how exposure to personal and neighborhood-level disadvantages impact methylation patterns associated with accelerated biological aging, inflammation, and chronic cardiovascular disease outcomes. Our findings will highlight the variability in human biological responses to adversity and inform clinical and policy-level interventions to reduce and mitigate health disparities.","Researching

It will use qualitative and cultural approaches along with personal interviews to engage members (50 years and over) of the tribes to determine their perspectives on well-aging, the perceived challenges associated with aging and existing resources for promoting health in aging, and areas of unmet needs. The information gathered will be the foundation to design a culturally appropriate survey for the target group and the results will be shared in tribal leadership. Lastly, the Administrative Core will function as administrative support for the student project and individual research studies by providing oversight through the IRB, providing/dispersing information on resources and mentoring opportunities, and guidance in evaluation planning. Program Narrative Indian Health Council, Inc. (IHC) with San Diego State University (SDSU) and University of California San Diego (UCSD), intends to build upon their already existing long-term research partnership with the following proposed projects/studies in the NARCH X application: Student Development Program, Child Development Resource Center, Addressing HIV/STI Awareness and Prevention among Rural American Indians, Aging Well in Indian Country and the Administrative Core.

"Data-Driven Identification of Costly Multi-Morbidity Groupings and their Progression The PI proposes a high-impact collaborative research project to identify the most prevalent multimorbidity combinations; develop an understanding of the typical sequence of disease progression for each multimorbidity combination; and assess the incremental costs associated with each progression. The Center for Health Care Strategies calls for developing the means to identify homogeneous multimorbidity subgroups to more effectively develop targeted interventions. This work will support the National Institute on Aging 21st Century strategic directions for research on aging especially goals (E and F) related to understanding health differences, health disparities and developing strategies for intervention and policy decisions. Through completing the study's three aims, we will significantly improve scientific knowledge. A lack of emphasis on multimorbidities can have a significant negative impact on care. Factoring in multimorbidity should better explain healthcare expenditures. Understanding the typical disease progression sequence for each multimorbidity combination has the potential to assist with estimating the future healthcare burden and understand relationships between different diseases. The process of formulating interventions to treat and prevent combinations of comorbid diseases can be made simpler, less costly, more reliable and repeatable, more personalized, and more productive. To our knowledge, no research has attempted to identify all common multimorbidity patterns in a population of this size using a similar method, nor identified progression patterns at this scale. Further, greater insight into multimorbidities combinations is essential to further aging research as a significant proportion of the trend in multimorbidity is attributable to aging. Additionally, the research project we propose will allow us to expand our compute cluster, which is accessible online for both masters and Ph.D. students. The research itself will allow them to improve data science skills learned in the classroom, and help us matriculate master's students to our Ph.D. program—a trend that has already started. Furthermore, a significant percentage of our student body is composed of underrepresented minorities and women. This research will help expose many of them to opportunities they would not otherwise have. The proposed research is relevant to public health because a lack of emphasis on multimorbidities can have a significant negative impact on care. Additionally, greater insight into multimorbidity combinations is essential to further aging research. This proposal aims to provide the medical and public health community with a greater understanding of multimorbidity development and trends.",Data-Driven Identification of Costly Multi-Morbidity Groupings and their Progression,9962881,R15AG067232,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Employment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Traditional Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Population Sizes ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Students ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Managed Care ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' skills ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Subgroup ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Output ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' cost ', ' data grid ', ' datagrid ', ' distributed computing ', ' cluster computing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' treatment strategy ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"Academic Leadership Award in Alzheimer's Disease and Aging Research for Chau Trinh-Shevrin, DrPH Project Abstract As the older population increases, it is also becoming more diverse, reflecting U.S. demographic changes as a whole. There is a disproportionate burden of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations and the lack of an evidence base to effectively prevent and reduce these disparities. There is urgent need to cultivate a cadre of health disparities researchers who can advance translational research in aging and ADRD disparities in both clinical practices and community-based settings. My overarching aim with this K07 award is to provide training and mentorship opportunities in participatory research principles, health disparities research methods, systems science approaches, and dissemination and implementation research methods while convening a network of transdisciplinary faculty andcommunity advisors that supports mentored career development opportunities for aging and ADRD disparities research. With this proposal I seek to: 1) Establish a research training program to build academic capacity and leadership to advance the science of aging and ADRD health disparities; 2) Advance innovative participatory, systems science, and implementation science frameworks and methods for aging and ADRD research in minority and health disparity populations through curriculum development, pilot awards, and applied training opportunities; and 3) Mentor junior scientists in applying multi-level, community-engaged frameworks and rigorous methods to advance the science of aging and ADRD health disparities research. Approximately 50 faculty and postdoctoral fellows from NYU will participate in various K07 trainings, collaborative courses, and pilot projects for aging and ADRD disparities research. In addition, I will mentor approximately 12 mentees in aging and ADRD research. This K07 award will provide necessary support and time for me to: 1) develop and formalize a robust training and mentorship program that would provide the foundation for securing a T32 or similar training mechanisms to build the research workforce pipeline for aging and ADRD disparities research; 2) institutionalize a rigorous training program on fundamental and cutting-edge health disparities research methods into existing infrastructures to ensure long-term program sustainability; and 3) deepen my expertise and leadership in system science approaches and its integration with participatory research and implementation science frameworks relevant to aging and ADRD research. The impact of this K07 award will both accelerate the science of aging and ADRD disparities research and promote the training and career development of the next generation of aging and ADRD researchers to address NIA priorities. Project Narrative As the US population becomes older and more diverse, there is urgent need to cultivate a pool of health disparities researchers who can advance translational research in aging and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) disparities and promote evidence-based interventions in both clinical practices and community-based settings.

"Metabolic and Inflammatory Pathways of Midlife Neurocognitive Disparities Project Summary/Abstract Health is not randomly distributed across people or across space: it tracks a socioeconomic gradient that extends from individuals to the areas in which they live. Individual- and area-level attributes of socioeconomic disadvantage confer risk for a broad range of interrelated physical and neurocognitive health outcomes. This risk is especially apparent in midlife when pathophysiological trajectories of neurocognitive aging that predict risk for dementia in later life begin to accelerate. In this regard, we have provided some of the first evidence that individual- and area- level socioeconomic disadvantage associate with reduced cortical tissue volume and white matter integrity, aspects of brain morphology that show normative shrinkage and integrity loss with age in association with poorer cognitive outcomes. Pathways linking socioeconomic disadvantage to accelerated neurocognitive aging remain unclear. Recent evidence, including our own, suggests that metabolic factors may play a role. Individuals who develop metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for accelerated neurocognitive aging. Furthermore, our recent cross-sectional findings suggest that metabolic risk factors contribute to the associations of area-level disadvantage with brain morphology among midlife adults. Here, we aim to extend this work by longitudinally examining metabolic pathways linking individual- and area-level disadvantage to neurocognitive aging across a 10 year period of midlife. For this purpose, we propose reassessing a sample of 300 cognitively normal midlife adults on whom we collected baseline measures of socioeconomic parameters, metabolic risk, brain morphology and cognitive function 9-10 years ago (mean age at follow-up = 52). Our primary aims examine whether individual- and area-level measures of socioeconomic disadvantage predict changes in brain morphology and cognitive function that decline with age and whether associations of disadvantage with neurocognitive aging are explained by metabolic risk and associated inflammation. We anticipate that this study will contribute to new knowledge to the neurobiology of disparities in cognitive aging. Project Narrative As the US population ages, cognitive impairment is becoming a rising and intractable problem, particularly for individuals at relative socioeconomic disadvantage who are at increased risk for premature neurocognitive aging and dementia. The public health implications of the proposed research include the potential to identify modifiable risk factors that track a socioeconomic gradient and predict preclinical cognitive decline across mid-life, a period when differential trajectories of cognitive aging begin. The project focus is on metabolic risk factors that associate with disadvantage and may accelerate preclinical brain aging and cognitive decline.",Metabolic and Inflammatory Pathways of Midlife

"Enhancing UNderGraduate Education and Research in AGing to Eliminate Health Disparities (ENGAGED) The Enhancing UNderGraduate Education and Research in AGing to Eliminate Health Disparities (ENGAGED) program will address the clear need to increase the diversity of biomedical scientists involved in aging research and the dearth of under-represented (UR) trainees in graduate programs in the biomedical sciences, particularly in aging-related fields. Given the strengths in research on aging at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM) and in the existing didactic training in gerontology and aging-related topics at Wake Forest University (WFU) and Winston-Salem State University (WSSU), the ENGAGED Program Faculty (including Program Directors at WFSM, Co-Directors at WFU and WSSU) has vast academic and professional experiences; a history of collaborations for diversity-focused research and training programs; basic, clinical, population and translational research expertise and funding; and training program administration expertise. Thus, we are particularly well-positioned to offer training for undergraduate UR students to promote greater interest, exposure, and research experiences in the science of aging and health disparities in aging. The goals are to (1) increase awareness of the unique health care issues facing a diverse aging population and of the opportunities for research that addresses these issues and (2) expand opportunities for hands-on paid research internships at WFSM, WFU and WSSU during the academic year and during an 8-9 week summer session. These goals will be accomplished by ‘gerontologizing’ freshman seminars and introductory health science courses with lectures on topics relevant to aging; creating an ‘ENGAGED Research Club’ to foster a sense of community around the science of aging; providing a variety of educational activities, including field trips to research laboratories and geriatric clinics, real-world learning experiences in geriatric assessments and laboratory procedures, relevant workshops, seminars and journal clubs; and tracking trainee and program outcomes. Research internships will be offered under the direction of a diverse group of Research Mentors with expertise in cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes/obesity, kidney function/disease, neuroscience, and physical function, offering trainees a wide variety of research opportunities in the field of aging. A network of Research and Career Mentors will provide formal and informal resources and counseling on career paths in age-related biomedical research, particularly PhD/advanced degrees, during and after the program. Of note, ~40% of training faculty are UR minorities, and many have research expertise and/or clinical experience addressing health disparities in aging populations. In sum, the proposed ENGAGED program offers several innovative approaches to preparing UR students for a career in research in the field of aging and takes advantage of unique strengths, existing infrastructure, and long-standing collaborations among diverse faculty at WFSM, WFU, and WSSU to ensure successful creation and implementation of the program.

"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) PROJECT SUMMARY—OVERALL COMPONENT: The NIH has long recognized the necessity to aggressively leverage emerging methodologies like precision medicine, digital health, biomedical data science and virtual reality & simulation based interventions approaches to ameliorate health disparities in racial and ethnic minorities. However, relatively fewer efforts have attempted to conduct trans- disciplinary aging research integrating biological, social and behavioral sciences utilizing emerging methodologies. The overarching goal of the proposed Stanford Aging and Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) is to increase the diversity of the aging research workforce by mentoring new leaders in aging research and promoting advances in behavioral and social sciences aging research using emerging methodologies including precision medicine, digital health, biomedical big data science and virtual reality and simulation based interventions. By identifying, mentoring and supporting (through dedicated pilot funds and methodological and recruitment support) junior investigators from underrepresented groups (SAGE Scientists) we propose to create a culturally sensitive and culturally competent research workforce focused on promoting equity in healthcare and mitigating disparities in diverse older populations using emerging methodologies. We have in place outstanding strengths in the three principal scientific elements requisite to form a coordinated, sustainable, and far-reaching `aging research to practice collaboration' integrating behavioral, social and biological sciences using emerging methodologies: 1) Behavioral and social scientists and disparities researchers, spanning psychology, psychiatry, demography, epidemiology, evolutionary biology, health services research & economics, computer science, social media science, virtual reality/simulation interventions and digital health; 2). Extensive experience with trans-disciplinary translational research that integrates laboratory assessment of genetic markers, their relationships to both disease risk and treatment relevance with psychosocial research approaches; and 3) Novel and outstanding analytic and high-performance `big-data' computing capabilities, consolidated in our Department of Biomedical (`Big Data') Data Science. With Stanford's setting in one of the most racially, ethnically and socially diverse aging populations in the US, and leveraging the seven-school campus-wide “Precision Health” initiative that integrates biomedical data science, engineering, business, design, digital health technology, virtual reality interventions and patient care under the recently endowed Center for Population Health Sciences we feel uniquely situated to make game-changing breakthroughs in aging research using emerging methodologies, and to lead such research efforts nationally.

"Mechanisms of Disparities in Adverse Neurocognitive Outcomes among Hispanics Aging with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY The adverse consequences of HIV and related comorbidities on the central nervous system remain prevalent despite highly effective antiretroviral therapy, with approximately 40% of persons living with HIV showing neurocognitive impairment (NCI). Compared to other ethnic/racial groups in the United States, HIV infected (HIV+) Hispanics/Latinos/as, hereafter referred to as Hispanics, present with increased risk for NCI and neurocognitive decline; and this risk is particularly pronounced in older age. Yet, the factors underlying these disparities are not well understood. Guided by the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework, the present proposal aims to identify key mechanisms underlying adverse neurocognitive outcomes among Hispanics aging with HIV. Among the potential predictors of NCI in this group, the proposed study will focus on two biological processes -- metabolic syndrome and gut microbiome dysbiosis -- that may be particularly problematic among Hispanics and may result in greater brain vulnerability to HIV. The study will also integrate aspects of the physical/built and sociocultural environment (assessed via geocoding) that have been linked to metabolic syndrome and NCI, and investigate their influence on neurocognitive disparities in HIV. We will also explore the impact of behavioral (physical activity and diet) and healthcare (healthcare use and access, health literacy) variables. We will collect these data in 200 HIV+ and HIV-uninfected Hispanics (approximately half Spanish-speaking) aged 40 and over, and investigate their impact on neurocognitive status cross-sectionally and longitudinally over the course of three years. We will leverage existing longitudinal data from the UCSD HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program to select a comparison group of 100 HIV+ non-Hispanic Whites. To ensure the success of the proposed multidisciplinary approach, we have assembled a research team representing an integration of relevant disciplines, including cross-cultural neuropsychology, health disparities, medicine, public health, microbiomics, geography, and bioinformatics, and information systems. Recognizing the importance of a community-based participatory research approach in the study of health disparities, we have partnered with community clinics and stakeholders whose input has helped strengthen our approach and assure its relevance to the community. We will build on existing cross-sectional studies in Hispanics led by the PI for recruitment of participants into the proposed study, and our community partnerships will help assure that we reach the most vulnerable segments of the Hispanic community. With this multidisciplinary and community integrated approach to research, we aim to increase our understanding of the complexity that underlies mechanisms of disparities in neurocognitive outcomes among diverse groups of Hispanics aging with HIV. Such knowledge is crucial for the development of targeted, culturally relevant interventions to prevent or ameliorate HIV-associated NCI among Hispanics and reduce health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed observational longitudinal study aims to determine important mechanisms underlying disparities in neurocognitive outcomes among Hispanics aging with HIV. This is an important public health priority because: 1) the adverse impact of HIV and related comorbidities in the central nervous system are still prevalent and impactful; and 2) HIV-infected Hispanics are at higher risk for neurocognitive impairment, and this disparity is expected to increase with the aging of the HIV-infected population. Understanding factors that increase risk for adverse neurocognitive outcomes associated with HIV and aging among Hispanics may lead to the development of targeted, culturally relevant interventions to prevent and/or decrease HIV-disease progression in the central nervous system among Hispanics and reduce health disparities.",Mechanisms of Disparities in Adverse Neurocognitive Outcomes among Hispanics Aging with HIV,10180770,R01MD013502,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Blood -

"Using a Randomized Prevention Trial to Understand the Health Benefits of Supportive Couple Relationships among Rural African American Adults PROJECT SUMMARY In this proposal, we seek to follow a well-characterized sample of 346 low-income, middle-age African American couples who recently concluded participation in a randomized prevention trial of the Protecting Strong African American Families (ProSAAF) program. All couples reside in impoverished small towns and communities in rural Georgia in which poverty rates are among the highest in the nation. Individuals in this catchment area are at elevated risk for multiple chronic diseases of aging (CDAs) including cardiovascular disease and diabetes as well as risk factors for CDAs such as inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Continuing to follow this sample with more thorough assessments of aging over the next five years will provide one of the first prospective studies of couple relationships and aging conducted within a randomized prevention trial designed for rural African American adults. As observational designs are prone to residual confounding and reverse directionality errors, the current proposal will provide a unique opportunity for testing casual hypotheses about the role of enhanced couple functioning in promoting and protecting the health of African American adults from the erosive effects of cumulative stress exposure. This proposal, therefore, is directly responsive to PA-15-042, which encourages innovative, hypothesis-driven R01 grant applications that can expand understanding of the role and impact of families and interpersonal relationships on health and well-being in midlife and older age. In this continuation then, we propose to collect two additional waves of multi-level data from couples who participated in the ProSAAF trial. This data collection will involve intravenous blood draws and other biometrics to determine whether ProSAAF participation and program-induced changes in couple functioning will carry forward to promote African Americans' healthy aging. Assessments of psychological well-being and behavioral coping strategies will be collected as well. We will test hypotheses concerning: (a) ProSAAF participation on the physical health and psychological well-being of rural African American adults; (b) mediating mechanisms through which ProSAAF- induced changes in couple relationship functioning and cumulative stress exposure influence rural African Americans' health; and (c) resilience mechanisms on healthy aging among rural African Americans. Hypotheses will be analyzed using individual- and couple-level models to examine actor, partner, and dyadic-level effects. Our proposed design provides both strong tests of theory and enhanced ability to guide practical application than typically is possible using observational research alone. Findings from this research will facilitate the development of health promotion strategies to enhance healthy aging and, ultimately, reduce health disparities among rural African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  African American adults in the rural Southeast have some of the highest rates of chronic diseases of aging, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, cancer, and dementia. These health disparities originate in part from African Americans' exposure to chronic stressors in rural Southern environments. The proposed study will investigate whether participation in a prevention program designed to enhance couple relationships, the Protecting Strong African American Families, will carry forward to promote and protect the health and well-being of rural African American adults.",Using a Randomized Prevention Trial to Understand the Health Benefits of Supportive Couple Relationships among Rural African American Adults,9918840,R01AG059260,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' antiinflammatory ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Family Relations ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Poverty ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Weather ', ' cytokine ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' race discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Intravenous ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Feels well ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' psychological wellness ', ' self wellness ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' Well in self ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' stressor ', ' Prevention program ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' protective effect ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' healthy aging ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Prevention trial ', ' trial design ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' racial health disparity ', ' rural African American ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2020,650396,0.10067685575278564
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole.

"Summer of Translational Aging Research for Undergraduates (STARU) PROJECT SUMMARY As the population of older adults increases dramatically, age-related illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other degenerative disorders present a great public health burden, currently affecting an estimated to 5.4 million Americans. It is well documented that older adults from ethnic minority and lower socioeconomic backgrounds are at increased risk for AD and other disorders of aging. There is thus an urgent need to increase the number of scientists from diverse backgrounds who are committed to the study of aging and age- related health disparities. The proposed Summer of Translational Aging Research for Undergraduates (STAR U) program is guided by three axioms related to biomedical research on aging: 1. The diversity of the older adult population is increasing and there are systematic racial/ethnic disparities related to disorders of aging that are poorly understood; 2. Scientific advancement relies upon diversity of background, experience, ideas, and perspectives; increasing the diversity of scientists involved with biomedical research of aging is necessary to provide the cultural sensitivity and knowledge to understand sources of disparities in aging; and 3. Despite increases in the number of underrepresented minorities receiving higher education, a large percentage do not pursue careers in science. STAR U seeks to overcome historic barriers that have prevented such students from pursuing careers in scientific and aging research. Through a structured summer research program, STAR U will provide 10-12 students per year with: 1) individual, tailored research mentorships in the neuroscience of aging; 2) a range of translational learning opportunities; and 3) professional networking and social experiences. Research opportunities will span areas such as patient-oriented clinical research, cognitive neuroscience, basic science, and the epidemiological study of cognitive aging and its disorders. STAR U students will gather formally once per week for a two-hour seminar session that will include one hour devoted to a scientific topic, and one hour devoted to professional/academic development. Scientific training will focus on major themes in aging research, research methodologies, and general content areas relevant to developing scientific careers. Personal and professional development will be fostered through social gatherings as well as seminars on career development, learning how to find and work effectively with mentors, balance personal and professional demands, choosing the type of graduate training that is most appropriate for them, communicating effectively in science, and applying to graduate/medical school effectively. The long-term goal of the Summer of Translational Aging Research for Undergraduates is to enhance the field of aging and age-related disparities research by infusing it with diverse, well-trained scientists.

"Healthcare stereotype threat, health disparities, and minority aging PROJECT SUMMARY Health disparities among aging African Americans and Latinos are substantial and persistent. 1 With large segments of these populations living in poverty, healthcare access and quality are major contributors to their disproportionate burdens of disease, disability, and death. Yet, African American and Latino later life health disparities persist even in higher socioeconomic contexts. 2 This suggests that, in addition to economic barriers, there are psychosocial barriers to healthcare resource use, or utilization, and, thus, good health among aging minorities. The purpose of the proposed career development and research is to provide new understanding of later life health disparities by examining a previously overlooked psychosocial barrier to care among aging minorities, namely healthcare stereotype threat (HCST), 3-9 and how it can be ameliorated. Stereotype threat is the threat of being personally reduced to a group stereotype, 10-13 which can lead individuals to avoid stereotype-relevant domains. 10-12 For example, females have been shown to avoid STEM fields, leadership roles, and other stereotypically male domains to avoid stereotypes of inferiority and their negative social and psychological consequences. 14,15 My central hypothesis is that stereotypes regarding unhealthy lifestyles, low status, and inferior intelligence are salient for aging minorities in healthcare settings and influence healthcare resource use and health outcomes. The first of its kind, the proposed research will investigate the research questions of whether and how HCST contributes to disparities in healthcare resource use and health in aging African Americans and Latinos as compared to Whites. The approach is informed by Stereotype Threat Theory3,9,10,16,17 and my Culture and Social Identity Health Theory. 18 Specific Aims are threefold: (1) To document the association of ethnicity/race-based and age-based HCST to cross- sectional and longitudinal healthcare resource use and health outcomes among African American, Latino, and White older adults; (2) To use randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine economic and other moderators of the link between HCST and perceptions of the healthcare environment, including healthcare resource quality; and (3) To use RCT to examine how matching patients and physicians on race/ethnicity and/or age impacts the association between HCST and perceptions of healthcare resource quality. The proposed research design consists of three studies, employs a combination of survey and experimental methods, and involves both primary data collection and secondary data analysis. An assistant professor of Gerontology and Psychology at the University of Southern California, I (Candidate: Abdou) possess interdisciplinary expertise in psychology, social epidemiology, population health, and lifespan and intergenerational health disparities. This NIA K01 will provide the unique opportunity to augment my current expertise with training in health economics, health services research, and advanced training in stereotype threat and statistical and research methods (i.e., longitudinal data, RCT). Alongside my strong interdisciplinary mentorship team, I will receive the necessary support and training to work toward my long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program, including development of a successful NIH R01, to reduce later life health disparities and improve minority aging through the reduction of HCST and its sociocultural and psychobiological consequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research and training are aligned with NIA priorities, the NIH mission, and U.S. Healthy People 2020 goals to improve quantity and quality of life for all people. Expected positive impacts include the creation of stereotype-safer healthcare environments and the reduction of health disparities among aging minorities.","Healthcare stereotype threat, health

"Center for Improving Care Delivery for the Aging (CICADA) Delivering high-quality, accessible, and affordable health care to older Americans is fundamental to their health, wellbeing, function, and independence. Yet, with a growing chronic disease burden, rapid growth of health care costs, and fragmentation of care delivery, aging Americans are increasingly finding that high- quality care is not available, accessible, or affordable. The health care system in the United States (US) is not organized to address the fundamental health needs of older Americans. Moreover, the persistence of health disparities in the US, particularly for minority elders, suggests that health system dysfunction affects this population disproportionately. There is a critical need to reorganize and reorient health care delivery to coordinate care; maintain and improve quality of life as populations age; address inequities and health disparities; and implement new models of payment rewarding the value of care rather than the volume of care.  Health services research (HSR) studies the organization, financing, and delivery of health care, providing an evidence base that is central to addressing issues of care quality, access, affordability, and equity. HSR is critical to identifying and implementing solutions to improve the current shortcomings of health care delivery and, thus, the health and wellbeing of aging Americans. As a discipline, HSR has been a cornerstone of identifying and addressing disparities in health and health care delivery.  Minority investigators are underrepresented in HSR, with Blacks and Hispanics accounting for only 6.9% and 3.7%, respectively, of the HSR workforce. Yet underrepresented HSR researchers bring essential diverse perspectives and, often, personal experiences to bear in understanding the social, economic, political, and environmental determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care. Furthermore, according to the federal Office of Minority Health, underrepresentation in research leads to underfunding of health research as well as a lack of culturally appropriate theories, models, and methodologies. Thus, developing a representative cadre of researchers who can undertake studies that address the challenges facing our aging population and, in particular, disparities in aging, is an absolute priority.  To address this need, we propose the Center for Improving Care Delivery for the Aging (CICADA), a Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). CICADA aims to train emerging scientists from underrepresented backgrounds in the interdisciplinary science of HSR as it applies to the most pressing issues for aging Americans, particularly minority elders. Redressing researchers from backgrounds underrepresentation in HSR is critical to finding innovative public health solutions, creating a robust learning environment, and developing the trust needed to implement innovative solutions in minority populations.

"Autonomic regulation of blood pressure in premature and early menopausal women Project Summary/Abstract Aging is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and women who experience premature or early menopause have a 50% greater risk for CVD-related death compared with women who experience menopause at the typical age. Indeed, CVD increases aggressively after menopause and is the leading cause of mortality in women in the US. Autonomic and blood pressure (BP) dysregulation, often demonstrated in postmenopausal women, is associated with CVD. Although literature suggests that estrogen is cardioprotective for premenopausal women, little is known regarding how the early loss of sex hormones in premature and early menopause effect BP regulation. This application for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is designed to advance knowledge important for understanding mechanisms contributing to increased CVD in aging women and support the career of Dr. Manda L Keller-Ross, DPT, PhD, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, in the Medical School at the University of Minnesota. Dr. Keller- Ross is the PI of the Cardiovascular Research and Rehabilitation Laboratory, where the proposed research will take place. The long-term objectives of this proposal are to determine mechanisms that contribute to greater risk of CVD in premature and early menopausal women. Specifically, Dr. Keller-Ross aims to determine mechanisms driving autonomic BP regulation in premature and early menopausal women near the age of menopausal onset (Aim 1). She will then determine mechanisms driving autonomic BP regulation in women who have lived ≥10 years without functioning ovaries to determine the long-term effects (Aim 2). This proposal is in line with the mission of the NIA, to understand the nature of the aging process in women and how the loss of sex hormones contributes to the number one killer in women, CVD. Dr. Keller-Ross has a clinical research background and seeks mentored training and skill development to enhance her knowledge on biology of aging, women’s health specific to the cardiovascular system and menopause and advanced techniques to measure autonomic function. She will accomplish her career development goals through a combination of formal coursework, mentored skill and technique development for microneurography to measure muscle sympathetic nerve activity and noninvasive measures of baroreflex function and the empirical research described above. Dr. Keller-Ross has established an interdisciplinary mentorship team to guide her in these research and training activities. This committee has senior-level expertise in aging research in females, autonomic regulation of BP research and biostatistical analysis. They are eminently qualified and fully committed to assisting Dr. Keller-Ross to further her training, research and career path and achieve her career objectives. With this training, Dr. Keller-Ross is poised to become a leading scientist in cardiovascular health in aging women, producing research that is directly translatable to clinical practice devising strategic preventative and rehabilitative therapies to improve cardiovascular health, specific to aging women. Project Narrative Aging women are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, which is the number-one killer of women in the US and women who enter menopause prematurely have a 50% increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared with women who enter menopause at a typical age. The proposed research aims to determine mechanisms that contribute to autonomic and blood pressure dysregulation in younger and older premature- and early-menopausal women, providing fundamental knowledge of the causes of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases in these women. Results from this study will inform future studies on prevention and treatment strategies to improve cardiovascular health in aging women.",Autonomic regulation of blood pressure in premature and early menopausal women,9977592,K01AG064038,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Career Choice ', ' Career Path ', ' career aspiration ', ' career interest ', ' career pathway ', ' career track ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Skills ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menopause ', ' Premature Menopause ', ' early menopause ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve ', ' Ovary ', ' Physical Medicine ', ' Physiatrics ', ' Physiatry ', ' Rehabilitation Medicine ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' sex steroid ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Biological Aging ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Ovarian ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Pre-Menopause ', ' Pre-menopausal Period ', ' Premenopausal ', ' Premenopausal Period ', ' pre-menopausal ', ' Premenopause ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' post-menopausal ', ' postmenopausal ', ' Postmenopause ', ' Baroreceptor Reflex ', ' Baroreflex ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Bilaterial Ovariectomy ', ' Female Castration ', ' Bilateral oophorectomy ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' prophylactic ', ' Techniques ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' BP control ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP management ', ' BP regulation ', ' blood pressure control ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure management ', ' regulate BP ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Autonomic Dysfunction ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' career development ', ' technique development ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' International ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' early onset ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' older women ', ' skill development ', ' skill acquisition ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' treatment strategy ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Heart health ', ' Cardiac health ', ' cardioprotectant ', ' cardioprotective ', ' cardioprotection ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,K01,2020,131760,0.005196694024144676
"An Analysis of Psychosocial Risk and Protective Factors: Accelerated Cognitive Aging and Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Among Retired NFL & Former NCAA Football Players Project Summary/Abstract: Robert W. Turner II is a Research Associate in the Center on Biobehavioral Health Disparities Research at Duke University. He has training in medical sociology, ethnographic methods, and health disparities research as well as a strong commitment to improving the mental health of adult males. His previous and current work has exposed him to theoretical perspectives and empirical approaches pertinent to health disparity and aging research among men. The current proposal is for a five year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that address gaps in his knowledge of biobehavioral factors underlying mild traumatic brain injury mTBI and accelerated cognitive aging. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Tim Strauman, Keith Whitfield, and Toni Antonucci) he has developed a comprehensive training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on the interrelationships between multiple measures of psychosocial and neurocognitive factors associated with accelerated cognitive aging, and serve as bridge for him to establish an independent investigator career in conducting biobehavioral health disparities research in aging adult male populations. To accomplish this goal, he proposes four career development activities and three research aims that combines instruction with established scholars in survey research techniques; formal coursework; participation in ongoing seminars at Duke University; one-to-one directed readings with mentors; and finally, conduction of a “proof of concept study” from start to finish. Preliminary data will be collected with using a mixed-method design that consists of a survey, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by creating a more robust overall portrait of psychosocial protective and risk factors that may impact the long-term consequences of mTBI among men than previously possible. The approach used in this project will address; a) male vulnerabilities in predicting the impact of psychosocial factors on accelerated cognitive aging and b) how understandings of masculinity develop across and within groups in relationship to pain, injury, and brain health. This project will continue to build on insights he has gained through his examination of data from the Study of Retired NFL Players. By completing these aims, he will test important hypotheses and make a substantial contribution to the evidence base by describing the process of cognitive accelerated aging resulting from mTBI. This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore innovative approaches to address functional, cognitive, and psychosocial vulnerabilities in concussed men, and may ultimately reduce the risk of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Alzheimer's disease resulting from concussions. It will also inform an R-series grant proposal to study accelerated cognitive aging and brain imaging that Dr. Turner plans to submit in year 4 of the project. Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is a common, costly, and potentially preventable condition in the United States. Despite heightened awareness as a result of national public health campaigns and increased visibility in the media, many individuals continue to be at risk of life- long and sometime debilitating effects of brain injury. The goal of this project is to explore innovative approaches to address functional, cognitive, and psychosocial vulnerabilities in concussed men, which may ultimately reduce the risk of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Alzheimer's disease resulting from concussions.",An Analysis of Psychosocial Risk and Protective Factors: Accelerated Cognitive Aging and Mild Traumatic Brain
