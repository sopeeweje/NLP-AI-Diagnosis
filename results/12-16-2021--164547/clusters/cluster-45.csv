"Minority Predoctoral Fellowship Program DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  In 1996, 41 percent of adults with AIDS in the U.S. were black, exceeding for the first time the percentage that was non-Hispanic white.  One reason for this disparity may be differences in the quality of healthcare that minorities receive.  Studies of quality of healthcare disparities have tended to look at physician, patient, or site characteristics in isolation.  Thus, little is known about the relative importance of these factors and how they interact to give rise to disparities in healthcare.  Using cross-sectional data from a national survey of HIV patients, the proposed research will use hierarchical modeling to assess the impact of individual, clinical, and contextual factors on racial and ethnic disparities in HIV care.  More specifically, it will estimate the impact of trust on adherence and assess any racial differences in trust; evaluate whether African Americans and whites receive care at sites that are systematically different in the quality of care they provide; and estimate the impact of contextual variables such as neighborhood race, education, and income on the quality of care provided by clinics, controlling for both individual and site effects.  Results of the study will be useful to providers and policymakers dedicated to improving disparities in HIV care.

"Health Outcomes/Cost of Early vs Delayed ART in Haiti    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is debate regarding the optimal time to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings. The research goal of Dr. Serena Koenig, an infectious disease fellow and associate physician in the Division of Social Medicine and Health Inequalities at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is to determine the optimal time to initiate ART in patients with symptomatic HIV disease in Haiti using a decision modeling approach to incorporate complex trade-offs among clinical benefits, risk of toxicity, and financial cost. She will carry out the proposed health outcomes study in parallel with a randomized control trial that will be conducted by the GHESKIO research center in Port au Prince to compare survival and TB outcomes for early versus delayed treatment of patients with pre-AIDS symptomatic HIV disease. She will be mentored by Drs. Sue Goldie, Warren Johnson, and Jean William Pape. This research plan is composed of three specific aims: 1. To measure quality of life and adherence to ART among patients in the early and delayed treatment groups in the clinical trial, and to conduct an interview study of patients and other members of the Haitian community to compare the values they place on health at different stages of HIV disease. 2. To perform a cost analysis of HIV care in Haiti using clinical trial data and retrospective data collected on patients treated at GHESKIO and elsewhere in Haiti. This analysis will estimate the initial, induced, and averted costs of health-care resources over time for early versus delayed ART. 3. To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of early versus delayed ART in Haiti from a societal perspective. Outcome measures will include life expectancy, lifetime total direct medical costs, and costeffectiveness in dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained and in disability-adjusted life-year gained. Results will be stratified based on the presence or absence of active tuberculosis (TB) infection and sensitivity analyses will examine the impact of adherence rates.           ",Health Outcomes/Cost of Early vs Delayed ART in Haiti,7286030,K01TW007142,"['Haiti ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Hospitals ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Numbers ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' Funding ', ' Malaria ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Mentors ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social Medicine ', ' Societies ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' State Government ', ' Provincial Government ', ' Time ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' United States ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' fighting ', ' Woman ', ' World Bank ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Week ', ' Complex ', ' Country ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' Formulation ', ' Outcome Study ', ' cohort ', ' treatment planning ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' efavirenz ', ' 6-chloro-4-cyclopropylethynyl-4-trifluoromethyl-1,4-dihydro-2H-3,1-benzoxazin-2-one ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Lamivudine/Zidovudine ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Schedule ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communities ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' disability-adjusted life years ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Living Costs ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Financial cost ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Range ', ' International AIDS ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Guidelines ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' ']",FIC,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2007,120433,0.09835725510756796
"Letrozole Therapy for IVF/ET: Effects on Multiple Pregnancy and Treatment Burden    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is written in response to RFA-HD-06-008 to participate as a Clinical Site in an ongoing multicenter cooperative program designed to conduct clinical studies investigating problems in reproductive medicine. The application directly addresses the mission of the Reproductive Sciences Branch to ensure the birth of healthy, wanted babies through studies on human fertility and infertility. The long term objectives of the proposed project are to reduce the incidence of multiple pregnancy associated with assisted reproductive technology (ART), to reduce the incidence of excess embryo production and embryo cryopreservation associated with ART, and to reduce the burden on patients of ART therapy. Over 100,000 cycles of ART treatment are performed each year in the US, and ART is now responsible for 1% of all births. Advances in ART have increased its efficacy, but have also led to a large increase in the incidence of multiple pregnancies. The public health impact of ART associated multiple pregnancies cannot be overstated. The majority of ART cycles in the US employ complex treatment regimens entailing self administration of multiple parenteral drugs and intensive outpatient monitoring. These regimens facilitate the creation of multiple embryos, which promotes the transfer and cryopreservation of excess embryos. The proposed project aims to address the shortcomings of conventional ART therapy by examining via a randomized clinical trial design an alternative ovarian stimulation regimen based on the oral administration of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole and minimal monitoring. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) compare the incidence of multiple pregnancies in letrozole ART cycles with the incidence in conventional ART, 2) determine the incidence of embryo cryopreservation in the two treatment regimens, 3) compare the cumulative live born delivery rate per patient derived from two cycles of letrozole ART compared to one cycle of conventional ART, 4) examine the cumulative cost of two cycles of letrozole ART compared to the cost of a single cycle of conventional ART, and 5) compare self-reported levels of treatment burden and participant concerns between the two regimens. It is hypothesized that the cost savings and reduced treatment burden associated with letrozole therapy compared to conventional ART will allow patients to undergo two cycles of letrozole based ART, which will result in a similar live born delivery rate, a significantly lower incidence of multiple pregnancy and a significantly lower incidence of embryo cryopreservation. The relevance of the project derives from its potential to reduce multiple pregnancies with their attendant costs and risk of death and disability. The proposed examination of treatment costs is relevant given the problem of access to ART care, which limits appropriate utilization in the US. Finally, the project addresses relevant social and ethical concerns regarding embryo cryopreservation.           ",Letrozole Therapy for IVF/ET: Effects on Multiple Pregnancy and Treatment

"HIV, Race and Survival in the Highly Active Therapy Era    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced mortality in patients with HIV. Crude CDC data demonstrate that, though they had the same mortality in the pre-HAART era, mortality in 2000 was >15% higher for Hispanics with AIDS and >50% higher for African Americans with AIDS, compared to whites. The effectiveness of HAART has not been assessed in a nationally distributed population with HIV, and the factors contributing the mortality discrepancy are not well known. The goals of this proposal are to assess the magnitude of the HAART-era mortality discrepancy by race/ethnicity, and identify potentially modifiable factors responsible for that discrepancy. The research is based on a model of care that outlines crucial Steps of HIV Care, which in turn determine the overall effectiveness of HAART in clinical practice. These steps are: a) access outpatient care, b) utilize care services, and c) adhere to care. Past studies and preliminary data indicate that minorities may have difficulty with all 3 steps, but the relative influence that patient and process of care factors have on these Steps and the effect that the Steps have on survival are unknown. The specific aims for this proposal are: Specific Aim 1: To determine if the mortality rates of patients with HIV in routine clinical practice differed by race/ethnicity in the pre-HAART and HAART eras; Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the relationship between the Steps of HIV Care, patient factors, and mortality; Specific Aim 3: To develop an instrument to assess newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients' attitudes and beliefs about HIV disease and care; Specific Aim 4: To evaluate the relationship between patients' attitudes  and beliefs about HIV disease and care and patients' success in following the Steps of HIV Care. The first 2 Aims will be accomplished with retrospective cohort studies using a unique, national, Veteran's Health Administration HIV registry; the 3rd Aim with focus group and pilot studies of persons with HIV; and the last Aim with a prospective cohort study of patients newly diagnosed with HIV during hospitalization. This research will expand upon the principle investigator's current skills and past work by taking advantage of an outstanding research and mentoring environment, allowing him to acquire new and refine existing skills in the design and performance of patient-oriented clinical research, so that he will be an independent researcher improving the health of people with HIV.           ","HIV,

"Analyzing Patient-Provider Communication to Understand Disparities in HIV Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this research is to understand how differences in patient-provider communication affect disparities in the care received by persons with HIV. This knowledge will facilitate the development of evidence based interventions, with both patient and providers, to reduce or eliminate these disparities. A variety of types of disparities in HIV care between whites and non-whites have been demonstrated, including what may be the most consequential for patients, disparities in rates of initiation of and adhering to HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART). These disparities have many root causes, including care system access, differences in preferences or beliefs about the value of treatments, and bias against stigmatized groups such as injection drug users. An important source of these disparities may be differences in the nature and quality of patient-provider communication, a topic which has received little attention from HIV researchers. To fill this gap, we developed and validated a new method to code and analysis audiotapes of patient-provider interactions in HIV care, the General Medical Interaction Analysis System (GMIAS). A unique feature of this coding system is that it can characterize utterances in patient-provider dialog that are specifically related to ART adherence. We propose to use GMIAS to analyze transcripts of 437 patient-provider visits for persons with HIV collected as part of an existing study from 45 physicians practicing at 4 different care sites in Baltimore, New York, Detroit, and Portland. Patients were sampled from participating physicians' practice such that approximately half were white and half were non-white, which facilitates within-physician comparisons of racial/ethnic differences. Using the GMIAS coding system, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Compare general patterns of patient-provider communication between white, black, and Hispanic patients, 2) Compare ARV related adherence dialog between white, black, and Hispanic patients, and 3) Determine, using variance components analysis, how variance in patient-centeredness is partitioned between patients and providers. In addition, we will conduct exploratory analyses to determine whether 1-year clinical outcomes (changes in serum HIV viral RNA and CD4 counts) differ between blacks, Hispanics, and whites, and the extent to which differences in overall and adherence specific dialog quality explain differences in these outcomes. The relevance of this research to public health is that efforts to eliminate disparities in care related to race/ethnicity will require better data about the sources of those disparities. The results of this study will help us better understand how patient-provider dialog contributes to these disparities in HIV care, and provide a much needed evidence base for interventions with medical students, post-graduate trainees, practicing physicians, other health professionals, and patients to eliminate these disparities.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE While important disparities between the care received by whites and non-whites with HIV infection have been documented, including differences in rates of receipt of antiretroviral therapy, the source of these disparities is poorly understood. This project will use a new method to analyze audiotapes of routine office visits to understand how patient-provider dialogue differs by race and ethnicity.

"Test of an intervention to improve retention in HIV care after hospitalization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor retention in medical care is one of the primary reasons people die of HIV/AIDS today. Modern HIV treatment has transformed this deadly infection into a treatable chronic condition. There are no proven interventions to better retain people in HIV primary care. Hospitalized patients with HIV infection are at high risk for poor retention in care. A single or dual session intervention is essential for most patients out of care, because any patient who could be recruited into a multi-session intervention could likely be recruited back into primary care. Our team has been researching retention in HIV care for over 7 years. Using the information-motivation-behavioral skills model as a framework, our data indicate that among patients recently diagnosed with HIV infection, access to HIV primary care is affected by critical information gaps regarding the availability of care and treatment, limited motivation related to poor coping strategies and low trust in the healthcare system, and weak behavior skills reflected in low self-efficacy and social support around adherence to HIV care. These factors result in poor ability to navigate the health care system and remain in HIV care. We have developed a structured, theory-based, Patient Mentor Program. The Patient Mentor Program was developed to improve retention into HIV primary care by increasing patient knowledge about HIV and the care system, increasing self-efficacy, and promoting active self-management. In a one- time interaction at the Thomas Street Health Center, volunteer patient mentors greet new patients who are arriving for their intake visit to the clinic, guide them through the intake visit and support them. In our preliminary, quasi-experimental data, 88% of patients who had a patient mentor during that intake visit completed a physician visit within the next 90 days, compared to 78% of patients who did not have a mentor (p<.001). These effects remained significant after adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, and persisted into the 90-180 day interval after intake. We will test the efficacy of the TSHC patient mentor intervention in a 5-year randomized, controlled trial in 434 socio-economically and racially diverse HIV-infected patients hospitalized at Ben Taub General Hospital. We hypothesize that the intervention will meaningfully increase retention in HIV primary care after discharge compared to an attention control. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To test the efficacy of the patient mentor intervention on retention in HIV primary care after hospital discharge; 2) To test the efficacy of a patient mentor intervention on secondary outcomes that include health services use, health-related quality of life, and clinical outcomes; 3) To determine the mediating factors associated with response to the intervention, and the individual and system facilitators and barriers to retention in HIV primary care. This study addresses one of the most important challenges in HIV care today, i.e., expanding modern HIV treatment to all those in need, and may also impact race-based disparities in the health of people with HIV infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor retention in medical care is one of the primary reason people die of HIV/AIDS today.

"Medical Mistrust, Social Networks, and Disparities in HIV Care Among Blacks    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): African Americans with HIV fare worse than their White counterparts, with large racial/ethnic disparities at all points along the HIV care continuum. Compared to Whites with HIV, African Americans with HIV have lower levels of engagement and retention in care, and are less likely to be on state-of-the art antiretroviral treatment (ART); those on ART are less likely to be adherent at high enough levels for the treatment to be effective. The proposed 5-year project focuses on HIV-related medical mistrust (e.g., misconceptions, conspiracies such as that HIV is a form of genocide) as a barrier to HIV care and treatment behaviors. Specifically, the project will examine how social contexts, specifically, social networks (i.e., the constellation of social relationships surrounding an individual), may influence the spread of HIV-related medical mistrust, and in turn, affect treatment behaviors among African Americans with HIV. A total of 240 African Americans with HIV (120 not engaged in care, 120 on ART) will be followed over 12-months; data will be collected on the flow of HIV-related mistrust beliefs across social networks, as well as HIV care outcomes over time (engagement in care, adherence to ART). The research will conclude with active intervention conceptualization in partnership with community stakeholders in order to identify innovative social network-based solutions for improving treatment behaviors and ultimately, reducing disparities. The specific aims are: (1) To identify social network sources of HIV-related information (i.e., mistrust, misconceptions, conspiracies, and accurate information) among African Americans with HIV; (2) To examine the ways in which social network characteristics related to HIV mistrust are associated with HIV treatment behaviors across the HIV care continuum (engagement in care, antiretroviral treatment use, antiretroviral treatment adherence); and (3) Together with community stakeholders, to use study findings to identify novel intervention solutions to address mistrust and improve HIV treatment behaviors for African Americans with HIV. HIV-related mistrust is hypothesized to be spread through social networks and associated with specific network characteristics; individuals with high HIV-related mistrust are hypothesized to be less likely to be engaged in care and to be adherent to ART; and social network composition (e.g., level of mistrust in network) and structure (e.g., closeness of network members) are predicted to be related to HIV treatment behaviors (e.g., the relationship between mistrust and adherence will be greater for individuals in networks with high levels of mistrust). No research to date has used a social network approach to understanding the flow of HIV-related information and misconceptions among people with HIV.              PROJECT NARRATIVE  Large racial/ethnic disparities exist in HIV care, with African Americans less likely that Whites to be engaged in care, taking state-of-the art antiretroviral treatment (ART), and adherent to ART. Levels of HIV- related medical mistrust (including misconceptions, misinformation, and conspiracies, e.g., that HIV is a form of genocide) are high among African Americans and are thought to be a barrier to HIV care and treatment behaviors. We propose to examine how social contexts, specifically, social networks, may influence the spread of HIV-related mistrust, and in turn, affect HIV-related treatment behaviors across the HIV care continuum among African Americans with HIV.","Medical Mistrust, Social Networks, and Disparities in HIV Care Among Blacks",7806127,R01MD003964,"['Provider ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Affect ', ' improved ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Left ', ' Medical ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Play ', ' Poisons ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Solutions ', ' Arts ', ' Time ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Misinformation ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Network-based ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' treatment adherence ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2009,450624,0.22131502016738824

"Pathways to Engagement in HIV-Care for Newly-Diagnosed South Africans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the global effort to scale-up treatment programs and increase access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV+ people in resource-constrained nations, it is vital to understand how people become linked to HIV primary care, as many are entering care too late to benefit from ART. There is now significant momentum to promote HIV testing as a way to increase early enrollment in care, but relatively little attention to address the period immediately after a person receives an HIV+ diagnosis. As most studies of HIV+ individuals have been conducted among those already enrolled in care, there is limited knowledge concerning facilitators of and impediments to enrolling in HIV primary care and care-seeking more generally among those newly-diagnosed. The proposed four-year study, to be conducted in Kwa-Zulu-Natal, South Africa, seeks to fill this gap. Our goals are to determine the most salient influences on enrollment and retention in HIV care (regardless of ART eligibility) that, if addressed, could optimize use of services among newly diagnosed men and women in resource-constrained settings; and to identify collaboratively with key stakeholders promising interventions for further development and testing. The Specific Aims are to (1a) describe the ""time to enrollment"" cumulative incidence curve, estimate the proportion that enrolls in HIV primary care, and determine the facilitators of and barriers to enrollment and retention in care at multiple levels of influence - social structural (stigma, poverty, gender inequalities), health systems (organization, policies, providers), and individual (mental health, social cognitions, health-related behaviors); (1b) Explore decision-making around disclosure and enrollment/retention in care, and how stigma, poverty, gender inequalities, and health system factors shape these processes, through repeat in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of cohort participants; and (1c) Identify additional critical issues, including need for and use of mental health, reproductive, and other HIV-related ancillary services among newly diagnosed individuals.

"Analyzing Patient-Provider Communication to Understand Disparities in HIV Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this research is to understand how differences in patient-provider communication affect disparities in the care received by persons with HIV. This knowledge will facilitate the development of evidence based interventions, with both patient and providers, to reduce or eliminate these disparities. A variety of types of disparities in HIV care between whites and non-whites have been demonstrated, including what may be the most consequential for patients, disparities in rates of initiation of and adhering to HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART). These disparities have many root causes, including care system access, differences in preferences or beliefs about the value of treatments, and bias against stigmatized groups such as injection drug users. An important source of these disparities may be differences in the nature and quality of patient-provider communication, a topic which has received little attention from HIV researchers. To fill this gap, we developed and validated a new method to code and analysis audiotapes of patient-provider interactions in HIV care, the General Medical Interaction Analysis System (GMIAS). A unique feature of this coding system is that it can characterize utterances in patient-provider dialog that are specifically related to ART adherence. We propose to use GMIAS to analyze transcripts of 437 patient-provider visits for persons with HIV collected as part of an existing study from 45 physicians practicing at 4 different care sites in Baltimore, New York, Detroit, and Portland. Patients were sampled from participating physicians' practice such that approximately half were white and half were non-white, which facilitates within-physician comparisons of racial/ethnic differences. Using the GMIAS coding system, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Compare general patterns of patient-provider communication between white, black, and Hispanic patients, 2) Compare ARV related adherence dialog between white, black, and Hispanic patients, and 3) Determine, using variance components analysis, how variance in patient-centeredness is partitioned between patients and providers. In addition, we will conduct exploratory analyses to determine whether 1-year clinical outcomes (changes in serum HIV viral RNA and CD4 counts) differ between blacks, Hispanics, and whites, and the extent to which differences in overall and adherence specific dialog quality explain differences in these outcomes. The relevance of this research to public health is that efforts to eliminate disparities in care related to race/ethnicity will require better data about the sources of those disparities. The results of this study will help us better understand how patient-provider dialog contributes to these disparities in HIV care, and provide a much needed evidence base for interventions with medical students, post-graduate trainees, practicing physicians, other health professionals, and patients to eliminate these disparities.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE While important disparities between the care received by whites and non-whites with HIV infection have been documented, including differences in rates of receipt of antiretroviral therapy, the source of these disparities is poorly understood.

"Test of an intervention to improve retention in HIV care after hospitalization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor retention in medical care is one of the primary reasons people die of HIV/AIDS today. Modern HIV treatment has transformed this deadly infection into a treatable chronic condition. There are no proven interventions to better retain people in HIV primary care. Hospitalized patients with HIV infection are at high risk for poor retention in care. A single or dual session intervention is essential for most patients out of care, because any patient who could be recruited into a multi-session intervention could likely be recruited back into primary care. Our team has been researching retention in HIV care for over 7 years. Using the information-motivation-behavioral skills model as a framework, our data indicate that among patients recently diagnosed with HIV infection, access to HIV primary care is affected by critical information gaps regarding the availability of care and treatment, limited motivation related to poor coping strategies and low trust in the healthcare system, and weak behavior skills reflected in low self-efficacy and social support around adherence to HIV care. These factors result in poor ability to navigate the health care system and remain in HIV care. We have developed a structured, theory-based, Patient Mentor Program. The Patient Mentor Program was developed to improve retention into HIV primary care by increasing patient knowledge about HIV and the care system, increasing self-efficacy, and promoting active self-management. In a one- time interaction at the Thomas Street Health Center, volunteer patient mentors greet new patients who are arriving for their intake visit to the clinic, guide them through the intake visit and support them. In our preliminary, quasi-experimental data, 88% of patients who had a patient mentor during that intake visit completed a physician visit within the next 90 days, compared to 78% of patients who did not have a mentor (p<.001). These effects remained significant after adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, and persisted into the 90-180 day interval after intake. We will test the efficacy of the TSHC patient mentor intervention in a 5-year randomized, controlled trial in 434 socio-economically and racially diverse HIV-infected patients hospitalized at Ben Taub General Hospital. We hypothesize that the intervention will meaningfully increase retention in HIV primary care after discharge compared to an attention control. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To test the efficacy of the patient mentor intervention on retention in HIV primary care after hospital discharge; 2) To test the efficacy of a patient mentor intervention on secondary outcomes that include health services use, health-related quality of life, and clinical outcomes; 3) To determine the mediating factors associated with response to the intervention, and the individual and system facilitators and barriers to retention in HIV primary care. This study addresses one of the most important challenges in HIV care today, i.e., expanding modern HIV treatment to all those in need, and may also impact race-based disparities in the health of people with HIV infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor retention in medical care is one of the primary reason people die of HIV/AIDS today.

"Pathways to Engagement in HIV-Care for Newly-Diagnosed South Africans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the global effort to scale-up treatment programs and increase access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV+ people in resource-constrained nations, it is vital to understand how people become linked to HIV primary care, as many are entering care too late to benefit from ART. There is now significant momentum to promote HIV testing as a way to increase early enrollment in care, but relatively little attention to address the period immediately after a person receives an HIV+ diagnosis. As most studies of HIV+ individuals have been conducted among those already enrolled in care, there is limited knowledge concerning facilitators of and impediments to enrolling in HIV primary care and care-seeking more generally among those newly-diagnosed. The proposed four-year study, to be conducted in Kwa-Zulu-Natal, South Africa, seeks to fill this gap. Our goals are to determine the most salient influences on enrollment and retention in HIV care (regardless of ART eligibility) that, if addressed, could optimize use of services among newly diagnosed men and women in resource-constrained settings; and to identify collaboratively with key stakeholders promising interventions for further development and testing. The Specific Aims are to (1a) describe the ""time to enrollment"" cumulative incidence curve, estimate the proportion that enrolls in HIV primary care, and determine the facilitators of and barriers to enrollment and retention in care at multiple levels of influence - social structural (stigma, poverty, gender inequalities), health systems (organization, policies, providers), and individual (mental health, social cognitions, health-related behaviors); (1b) Explore decision-making around disclosure and enrollment/retention in care, and how stigma, poverty, gender inequalities, and health system factors shape these processes, through repeat in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of cohort participants; and (1c) Identify additional critical issues, including need for and use of mental health, reproductive, and other HIV-related ancillary services among newly diagnosed individuals. We will conduct a prospective Cohort Study following 550 newly- diagnosed women and men for eight months with structured assessments at Baseline, 4- and 8-month follow- up, repeat In-Depth Interviews with a subsample of 30, and additional assessment activities to evaluate variables of theoretical interest at the health system and social structural levels, utilizing GPS mapping, an Inventory of Health and Community Services, Media Tracking and Analysis, and structured Counselor Assessments.

"Medical Mistrust, Social Networks, and Disparities in HIV Care Among Blacks    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): African Americans with HIV fare worse than their White counterparts, with large racial/ethnic disparities at all points along the HIV care continuum. Compared to Whites with HIV, African Americans with HIV have lower levels of engagement and retention in care, and are less likely to be on state-of-the art antiretroviral treatment (ART); those on ART are less likely to be adherent at high enough levels for the treatment to be effective. The proposed 5-year project focuses on HIV-related medical mistrust (e.g., misconceptions, conspiracies such as that HIV is a form of genocide) as a barrier to HIV care and treatment behaviors. Specifically, the project will examine how social contexts, specifically, social networks (i.e., the constellation of social relationships surrounding an individual), may influence the spread of HIV-related medical mistrust, and in turn, affect treatment behaviors among African Americans with HIV. A total of 240 African Americans with HIV (120 not engaged in care, 120 on ART) will be followed over 12-months; data will be collected on the flow of HIV-related mistrust beliefs across social networks, as well as HIV care outcomes over time (engagement in care, adherence to ART). The research will conclude with active intervention conceptualization in partnership with community stakeholders in order to identify innovative social network-based solutions for improving treatment behaviors and ultimately, reducing disparities. The specific aims are: (1) To identify social network sources of HIV-related information (i.e., mistrust, misconceptions, conspiracies, and accurate information) among African Americans with HIV; (2) To examine the ways in which social network characteristics related to HIV mistrust are associated with HIV treatment behaviors across the HIV care continuum (engagement in care, antiretroviral treatment use, antiretroviral treatment adherence); and (3) Together with community stakeholders, to use study findings to identify novel intervention solutions to address mistrust and improve HIV treatment behaviors for African Americans with HIV.

"Pathways to Engagement in HIV-Care for Newly-Diagnosed South Africans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the global effort to scale-up treatment programs and increase access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV+ people in resource-constrained nations, it is vital to understand how people become linked to HIV primary care, as many are entering care too late to benefit from ART. There is now significant momentum to promote HIV testing as a way to increase early enrollment in care, but relatively little attention to address the period immediately after a person receives an HIV+ diagnosis. As most studies of HIV+ individuals have been conducted among those already enrolled in care, there is limited knowledge concerning facilitators of and impediments to enrolling in HIV primary care and care-seeking more generally among those newly-diagnosed. The proposed four-year study, to be conducted in Kwa-Zulu-Natal, South Africa, seeks to fill this gap. Our goals are to determine the most salient influences on enrollment and retention in HIV care (regardless of ART eligibility) that, if addressed, could optimize use of services among newly diagnosed men and women in resource-constrained settings; and to identify collaboratively with key stakeholders promising interventions for further development and testing. The Specific Aims are to (1a) describe the ""time to enrollment"" cumulative incidence curve, estimate the proportion that enrolls in HIV primary care, and determine the facilitators of and barriers to enrollment and retention in care at multiple levels of influence - social structural (stigma, poverty, gender inequalities), health systems (organization, policies, providers), and individual (mental health, social cognitions, health-related behaviors); (1b) Explore decision-making around disclosure and enrollment/retention in care, and how stigma, poverty, gender inequalities, and health system factors shape these processes, through repeat in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of cohort participants; and (1c) Identify additional critical issues, including need for and use of mental health, reproductive, and other HIV-related ancillary services among newly diagnosed individuals. We will conduct a prospective Cohort Study following 550 newly- diagnosed women and men for eight months with structured assessments at Baseline, 4- and 8-month follow- up, repeat In-Depth Interviews with a subsample of 30, and additional assessment activities to evaluate variables of theoretical interest at the health system and social structural levels, utilizing GPS mapping, an Inventory of Health and Community Services, Media Tracking and Analysis, and structured Counselor Assessments. To advance intervention development, we will review and integrate study findings and discuss promising interventions based on these findings with public officials, non-governmental organization (NGO) members and staff, health care providers, and HIV+ individuals through Interactive Community Feedback sessions; and conduct capacity-building Intervention Development Workshops to enhance agencies' and community members' capacity to rapidly formulate effective, pro-active responses.

"Test of an intervention to improve retention in HIV care after hospitalization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor retention in medical care is one of the primary reasons people die of HIV/AIDS today. Modern HIV treatment has transformed this deadly infection into a treatable chronic condition. There are no proven interventions to better retain people in HIV primary care. Hospitalized patients with HIV infection are at high risk for poor retention in care. A single or dual session intervention is essential for most patients out of care, because any patient who could be recruited into a multi-session intervention could likely be recruited back into primary care. Our team has been researching retention in HIV care for over 7 years. Using the information-motivation-behavioral skills model as a framework, our data indicate that among patients recently diagnosed with HIV infection, access to HIV primary care is affected by critical information gaps regarding the availability of care and treatment, limited motivation related to poor coping strategies and low trust in the healthcare system, and weak behavior skills reflected in low self-efficacy and social support around adherence to HIV care. These factors result in poor ability to navigate the health care system and remain in HIV care. We have developed a structured, theory-based, Patient Mentor Program. The Patient Mentor Program was developed to improve retention into HIV primary care by increasing patient knowledge about HIV and the care system, increasing self-efficacy, and promoting active self-management. In a one- time interaction at the Thomas Street Health Center, volunteer patient mentors greet new patients who are arriving for their intake visit to the clinic, guide them through the intake visit and support them. In our preliminary, quasi-experimental data, 88% of patients who had a patient mentor during that intake visit completed a physician visit within the next 90 days, compared to 78% of patients who did not have a mentor (p<.001). These effects remained significant after adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, and persisted into the 90-180 day interval after intake. We will test the efficacy of the TSHC patient mentor intervention in a 5-year randomized, controlled trial in 434 socio-economically and racially diverse HIV-infected patients hospitalized at Ben Taub General Hospital. We hypothesize that the intervention will meaningfully increase retention in HIV primary care after discharge compared to an attention control. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To test the efficacy of the patient mentor intervention on retention in HIV primary care after hospital discharge; 2) To test the efficacy of a patient mentor intervention on secondary outcomes that include health services use, health-related quality of life, and clinical outcomes; 3) To determine the mediating factors associated with response to the intervention, and the individual and system facilitators and barriers to retention in HIV primary care. This study addresses one of the most important challenges in HIV care today, i.e., expanding modern HIV treatment to all those in need, and may also impact race-based disparities in the health of people with HIV infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor retention in medical care is one of the primary reason people die of HIV/AIDS today.

"Telemedicine to Improve Depression and Adherence in HIV+ Women in the Rural South     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression has been recognized as a strong predictor of HIV care non-adherence, and consequently of increased morbidity and mortality. HIV-infected women are disproportionally affected by co-morbid depression in comparison to HIV-infected men. However, interventions addressing the psychosocial needs of HIV-infected women, particularly in the rural Deep South of the United States where HIV prevalence remains high, are limited. To address this fundamental gap in HIV care of HIV-infected women, the long-term goal is to develop an effective intervention that significantly improves clinical outcomes in HIV-infected women by decreasing depression morbidity and simultaneously increasing both adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and retention in care. The objective of this application is to culturally adapt an established and effective cognitive- behavioral therapy for depression and antiretroviral therapy adherence (CBT-AD) and test its feasibility and acceptability to HIV care adherence among HIV-infected minority women living in the rural South of the US. Teleconferencing/telemedicine technology will be used to overcome structural barriers to health care access (e.g. transportation, access to mental health service providers) persistent in rural areas. To accomplish this objective, the specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To conduct formative research (i.e. focus groups, individual key informant interviews) among HIV-infected women and HIV care providers to inform the cultural adaptation of the CBT-AD intervention for HIV-infected women in rural areas of Alabama; 2) To systematically adapt the CBT-AD intervention to HIV-infected depressed women residing in rural Alabama and telemedicine technology, using an iterative open-label - non-randomized process; and 3) To assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the adapted CBT-AD in reducing depression and improving ART adherence and retention in care among HIV-infected depressed women via a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be recruited from three HIV care organizations serving 47 counties across Alabama, including 668 HIV-infected women in 2010. All sites are connected through telemedicine equipment facilitating the delivery of mental health service into rural areas in this proposal. The contribution of the proposed research is significant since it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lead to the development o therapies that meet the gender-specific, psychological and medical needs of HIV-infected women to improve adherence to ART and retention in care. The research proposed in this application is innovative because of: 1) Its focus on an understudied vulnerable population, namely HIV-infected women residing in the Deep South who have been shown to be economically disadvantaged and burdened by high rates of depression; 2) Its plan to culturally adapt an intervention that aims at decreasing depression morbidity and simultaneously increases retention and adherence to HIV care and 3) Its use of telemedicine technology, which will allow for barriers of access to care and mental health services to be addressed.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it provides innovative solutions to obstacles related to antiretroviral therapy adherence and retention in care among HIV-infected women experiencing high rates of depression. Thus the proposed research directly meets the goals of the NIH's FY 2011 Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-related Research and the White House's National HIV/AIDS Strategy, which aim at reducing health disparities by studying interventions that impact adherence to HIV therapeutic regimens and medical care among HIV-infected women and girls. Furthermore it identifies the need for evaluating the impact of HIV- unrelated therapies and co-morbidities, including mental health disorders, on access to health care.                  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it provides innovative solutions to obstacles related to antiretroviral therapy adherence and retention in care among HIV-infected women experiencing high rates of depression.

"Pathways to Engagement in HIV-Care for Newly-Diagnosed South Africans  With the global effort to scale-up treatment programs and increase access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV+ people in resource-constrained nations, it is vital to understand how people become linked to HIV primary care, as many are entering care too late to benefit from ART. There is now significant momentum to promote HIV testing as a way to increase early enrollment in care, but relatively little attention to address the period immediately after a person receives an HIV+ diagnosis. As most studies of HIV+ individuals have been conducted among those already enrolled in care, there is limited knowledge concerning facilitators of and impediments to enrolling in HIV primary care and care-seeking more generally among those newly-diagnosed. The proposed four-year study, to be conducted in Kwa-Zulu-Natal, South Africa, seeks to fill this gap. Our goals are to determine the most salient influences on enrollment and retention in HIV care (regardless of ART eligibility) that, if addressed, could optimize use of services among newly diagnosed men and women in resource-constrained settings; and to identify collaboratively with key stakeholders promising interventions for further development and testing. The Specific Aims are to (1a) describe the ""time to enrollment"" cumulative incidence curve, estimate the proportion that enrolls in HIV primary care, and determine the facilitators of and barriers to enrollment and retention in care at multiple levels of influence - social structural (stigma, poverty, gender inequalities), health systems (organization, policies, providers), and individual (mental health, social cognitions, health-related behaviors); (1b) Explore decision-making around disclosure and enrollment/retention in care, and how stigma, poverty, gender inequalities, and health system factors shape these processes, through repeat in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of cohort participants; and (1c) Identify additional critical issues, including need for and use of mental health, reproductive, and other HIV-related ancillary services among newly diagnosed individuals. We will conduct a prospective Cohort Study following 550 newly- diagnosed women and men for eight months with structured assessments at Baseline, 4- and 8-month follow- up, repeat In-Depth Interviews with a subsample of 30, and additional assessment activities to evaluate variables of theoretical interest at the health system and social structural levels, utilizing GPS mapping, an Inventory of Health and Community Services, Media Tracking and Analysis, and structured Counselor Assessments. To advance intervention development, we will review and integrate study findings and discuss promising interventions based on these findings with public officials, non-governmental organization (NGO) members and staff, health care providers, and HIV+ individuals through Interactive Community Feedback sessions; and conduct capacity-building Intervention Development Workshops to enhance agencies' and community members' capacity to rapidly formulate effective, pro-active responses. 1  To maximize the benefits of expanded HIV testing and optimize the outcomes of ART scale-up with interventions that promote early linkage with primary HIV care and other supportive services, this study aims to determine the most salient influences on enrollment and retention in HIV primary care among newly diagnosed women and men (regardless of ART eligibility) in a context where HIV stigma and poverty are widespread, gender inequality prevails, health services are constrained and policies and programs are in flux, and where HIV care seeking includes the use of both Western and traditional modalities; and to identify collaboratively with community organizations, health care providers, public officials, and HIV+ individuals promising interventions for further development and testing.",Pathways to Engagement in HIV-Care for Newly-Diagnosed South Africans,8258789,R01MH083561,"['Affect ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Services ', ' Counseling ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Critiques ', ' Decision Making ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Sciences ', ' South Africa ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Screening procedure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' mother to child transmission ', ' Vertical Transmission ', ' Vertical Disease Transmission ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' social organization ', ' cohort ', ' care seeking ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' reproductive ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social cognition ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' microbicidal ', ' microbicide ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' International ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' care systems ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' coping ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' treatment adherence ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2012,568879,0.1264744882719655
"Social Patterns and Pathways of HIV Care among HIV Positive Transgender Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that there are more than one million people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the United States and each year there are approximately 56,300 new cases of infection. Transgender women (TGW), (i.e.,biological men who live their lives as women), are at particularly high risk for HIV infection and HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Various studies indicate that TGW have the highest HIV prevalence rates of all gender and sexual minorities. However, research also shows that they are less likely to enter and be retained in HIV care. Consequently, they are more likely to suffer adverse health outcomes and infect others. Even once they know they are HIV-infected, TGW are also less likely than other sexual minorities, such as men who have sex with men and bisexual men, to enter HIV care. Historically, research on gender and sexual minorities has included the transgender population in the collective group of lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons. Recent recommendations by the Office of National AIDS Policy and the Institute of Medicine have cautioned that this combined approach has obscured the differences that exist within and between these populations, and has resulted in inadequate examination of the health needs and experiences of the transgender population. This study aims to address these concerns and will explore TGW's experiences of HIV health care utilization (seeking, entering, or being retained in care). Specifically, it will examine the role of social network factors on TGW's decisions to enter into and remain engaged in care and describe the social dynamics (processes) that undergird their use of HIV care throughout the course of their illness. Given the paucity of research with this population, a grounded theory approach will be used to explore how social network norms influence TGW's decisions about when, where, how, and if to seek HIV care, as well as the patterns and pathways through which they enter, progress through, and are retained in care. HIV/AIDS is one of the most critical public health crises confronting gender and sexual minorities, especially TGW. Findings from this study will facilitate a better understanding of the social factors that determine HIV health care utilization behaviors (entry into and retention in care) of TGW following an HIV diagnosis. In addition, this study will contribute to the state of the science of transgender health by expanding knowledge of health care inequalities and transgender-specific health needs, two priority areas outlined by the Institute of Medicine. Results from this study wil provide a strong foundation for establishing a program of research in gender and sexual minority health. Importantly, the results will also be used to educate health care professionals about the needs of HIV infected TGW and to inform the development of strategies to facilitate HIV health care utilization in this population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transgender women (biological men who identify as women) have the highest rates of HIV infection of all gender and sexual minorities, yet are less likely to receive HIV care. Relationships in the social support system and health care encounters within the treatment system influence an individual's decision to seek, enter, and remain engaged in care. This study will provide information that will help us understand the social patterns and pathways of HIV care use among TGW and will contribute to development of social and structural interventions to improve HIV care and health outcomes for transgender women with HIV.              Transgender women (biological men who identify as women) have the highest rates of HIV infection of all gender and sexual minorities, yet are less likely to receive HIV care.

"Medical Mistrust, Social Networks, and Disparities in HIV Care Among Blacks    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): African Americans with HIV fare worse than their White counterparts, with large racial/ethnic disparities at all points along the HIV care continuum. Compared to Whites with HIV, African Americans with HIV have lower levels of engagement and retention in care, and are less likely to be on state-of-the art antiretroviral treatment (ART); those on ART are less likely to be adherent at high enough levels for the treatment to be effective. The proposed 5-year project focuses on HIV-related medical mistrust (e.g., misconceptions, conspiracies such as that HIV is a form of genocide) as a barrier to HIV care and treatment behaviors. Specifically, the project will examine how social contexts, specifically, social networks (i.e., the constellation of social relationships surrounding an individual), may influence the spread of HIV-related medical mistrust, and in turn, affect treatment behaviors among African Americans with HIV. A total of 240 African Americans with HIV (120 not engaged in care, 120 on ART) will be followed over 12-months; data will be collected on the flow of HIV-related mistrust beliefs across social networks, as well as HIV care outcomes over time (engagement in care, adherence to ART). The research will conclude with active intervention conceptualization in partnership with community stakeholders in order to identify innovative social network-based solutions for improving treatment behaviors and ultimately, reducing disparities. The specific aims are: (1) To identify social network sources of HIV-related information (i.e., mistrust, misconceptions, conspiracies, and accurate information) among African Americans with HIV; (2) To examine the ways in which social network characteristics related to HIV mistrust are associated with HIV treatment behaviors across the HIV care continuum (engagement in care, antiretroviral treatment use, antiretroviral treatment adherence); and (3) Together with community stakeholders, to use study findings to identify novel intervention solutions to address mistrust and improve HIV treatment behaviors for African Americans with HIV. HIV-related mistrust is hypothesized to be spread through social networks and associated with specific network characteristics; individuals with high HIV-related mistrust are hypothesized to be less likely to be engaged in care and to be adherent to ART; and social network composition (e.g., level of mistrust in network) and structure (e.g., closeness of network members) are predicted to be related to HIV treatment behaviors (e.g., the relationship between mistrust and adherence will be greater for individuals in networks with high levels of mistrust). No research to date has used a social network approach to understanding the flow of HIV-related information and misconceptions among people with HIV.              PROJECT NARRATIVE  Large racial/ethnic disparities exist in HIV care, with African Americans less likely that Whites to be engaged in care, taking state-of-the art antiretroviral treatment (ART), and adherent to ART. Levels of HIV- related medical mistrust (including misconceptions, misinformation, and conspiracies, e.g., that HIV is a form of genocide) are high among African Americans and are thought to be a barrier to HIV care and treatment behaviors. We propose to examine how social contexts, specifically, social networks, may influence the spread of HIV-related mistrust, and in turn, affect HIV-related treatment behaviors across the HIV care continuum among African Americans with HIV.","Medical Mistrust, Social Networks, and Disparities in HIV Care Among Blacks",8260122,R01MD003964,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Interview ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Play ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Poisons ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Solutions ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Misinformation ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Source ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Network-based ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' treatment adherence ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2012,400294,0.22131502016738824
"Test of an intervention to improve retention in HIV care after hospitalization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor retention in medical care is one of the primary reasons people die of HIV/AIDS today. Modern HIV treatment has transformed this deadly infection into a treatable chronic condition. There are no proven interventions to better retain people in HIV primary care. Hospitalized patients with HIV infection are at high risk for poor retention in care. A single or dual session intervention is essential for most patients out of care, because any patient who could be recruited into a multi-session intervention could likely be recruited back into primary care. Our team has been researching retention in HIV care for over 7 years. Using the information-motivation-behavioral skills model as a framework, our data indicate that among patients recently diagnosed with HIV infection, access to HIV primary care is affected by critical information gaps regarding the availability of care and treatment, limited motivation related to poor coping strategies and low trust in the healthcare system, and weak behavior skills reflected in low self-efficacy and social support around adherence to HIV care. These factors result in poor ability to navigate the health care system and remain in HIV care. We have developed a structured, theory-based, Patient Mentor Program. The Patient Mentor Program was developed to improve retention into HIV primary care by increasing patient knowledge about HIV and the care system, increasing self-efficacy, and promoting active self-management. In a one- time interaction at the Thomas Street Health Center, volunteer patient mentors greet new patients who are arriving for their intake visit to the clinic, guide them through the intake visit and support them. In our preliminary, quasi-experimental data, 88% of patients who had a patient mentor during that intake visit completed a physician visit within the next 90 days, compared to 78% of patients who did not have a mentor (p<.001). These effects remained significant after adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, and persisted into the 90-180 day interval after intake. We will test the efficacy of the TSHC patient mentor intervention in a 5-year randomized, controlled trial in 434 socio-economically and racially diverse HIV-infected patients hospitalized at Ben Taub General Hospital. We hypothesize that the intervention will meaningfully increase retention in HIV primary care after discharge compared to an attention control. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To test the efficacy of the patient mentor intervention on retention in HIV primary care after hospital discharge; 2) To test the efficacy of a patient mentor intervention on secondary outcomes that include health services use, health-related quality of life, and clinical outcomes; 3) To determine the mediating factors associated with response to the intervention, and the individual and system facilitators and barriers to retention in HIV primary care. This study addresses one of the most important challenges in HIV care today, i.e., expanding modern HIV treatment to all those in need, and may also impact race-based disparities in the health of people with HIV infection.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor retention in medical care is one of the primary reason people die of HIV/AIDS today. We have developed a structured, theory-based, Patient Mentor Program to improve retention into HIV primary care. We will test the efficacy of this patient mentor intervention in a 5-year randomized, controlled trial in more than 400 socio-economically and racially diverse HIV-infected patients hospitalized at Ben Taub General Hospital.

"Evaluating ART for All HIV Seropositives: Can it work with the hardest cases?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On World AIDS Day, December 1, 2011, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) announced a new policy that all HIV seropositives should be offered antiretroviral treatment (ART) regardless of CD4 cell count. The new policy was based primarily on ""treatment as prevention"" as a method for not only improving the health of people living with HIV who initiate ART early, but also as a means of reducing transmission of the virus. The NYCDOHMH set an ambitious goal for this new policy: by one year post HIV diagnosis, 80% of new HIV diagnoses will have reached viral suppression. There are over 3,400 new HIV infections occurring annually in NYC; recent data indicate 38% reached durable viral suppression in 2006-07 (i.e., all viral loads 400 copies/mL). The policy goal is ambitious, but if it were to be achieved, it would almost certainly lead to an ""AIDS-free generation"" - the central theme of the 2012 International AIDS Conference - in the city with the largest local HIV epidemic in the US. There are serious difficulties in achieving this policy goal, notably the persistent racial/ethnic disparities in HIV infection in the city, especially among African-Americans, and drug-related sexual transmission. The overarching purpose of this research is to provide multisystem data to evaluate the implementation of the policy and help determine the most efficient use of available resources for achieving the policy goal. The design and methods are informed by the ecological systems model, while the RE-AIM model guides the overall assessment of the implementation of the new policy. The study aims are: 1) to assess durable viral suppression (i.e., two consecutive viral load tests 400 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL of plasma) within 12 months of diagnosis among a) STD clinic cohort (N = 300) with problem substance use, and b) all new HIV diagnoses in NYC occurring during the project funding period (N=approximately 3,400/year); 2) to assess key indicators along the HIV treatment cascade among the STD clinic cohort as the percentage who (a) link to HIV care; (b) receive a recommendation to initiate ART; (c) initiate ART treatment; and (d) adhere to ART treatment; 3) to assess multisystem predictors of durable viral load suppression and other HIV treatment cascade indicators among the STD clinic cohort and cohort of all new HIV diagnoses in NYC, to include individual (e.g., race/ethnicity, substance use) and geospatial factors (e.g., socioeconomic conditions, social disorder, social cohesion, and spatial access to HIV-related healthcare); 4) to describe and contextualize quantitative outcomes in Aims 1-3 using STD cohort qualitative data; and 5) to describe the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of HIV treatment policies among HIV primary care providers. The endpoint of durable viral suppression increases  public health relevance as the primary indicator of HIV transmission risk. Data will be used to inform further implementation of the new policy, and in particular, to guide allocation of resources to reach the policy goal. Recommendations will be produced by a Collaborative Board comprised of community stakeholders and clinical researchers.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) has adopted a policy of offering anti- retroviral treatment (ART) to all newly diagnosed HIV seropositive persons, regardless of CD4 count, with a goal of reaching viral suppression in 80% of HIV seropositive persons within 12 months of diagnosis. If this ambitious policy goal can be achieved, it would be a major step towards an ""AIDS-free generation"" in the US city with the largest AIDS epidemic. The proposed research will evaluate the implementation of this policy, conducted in partnership with the DOHMH, and with recommendations for improvements informed through continuous feedback from a community collaborative board.            ",Evaluating ART for All HIV Seropositives: Can it work with the hardest cases?,8543428,R01DA035707,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Adoption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Life ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' cohesion ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Data ', ' International AIDS ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment adherence ', ' surveillance data ', ' ']",NIDA,ST.

"Telemedicine to Improve Depression and Adherence in HIV+ Women in the Rural South     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression has been recognized as a strong predictor of HIV care non-adherence, and consequently of increased morbidity and mortality. HIV-infected women are disproportionally affected by co-morbid depression in comparison to HIV-infected men. However, interventions addressing the psychosocial needs of HIV-infected women, particularly in the rural Deep South of the United States where HIV prevalence remains high, are limited. To address this fundamental gap in HIV care of HIV-infected women, the long-term goal is to develop an effective intervention that significantly improves clinical outcomes in HIV-infected women by decreasing depression morbidity and simultaneously increasing both adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and retention in care. The objective of this application is to culturally adapt an established and effective cognitive- behavioral therapy for depression and antiretroviral therapy adherence (CBT-AD) and test its feasibility and acceptability to HIV care adherence among HIV-infected minority women living in the rural South of the US. Teleconferencing/telemedicine technology will be used to overcome structural barriers to health care access (e.g. transportation, access to mental health service providers) persistent in rural areas. To accomplish this objective, the specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To conduct formative research (i.e. focus groups, individual key informant interviews) among HIV-infected women and HIV care providers to inform the cultural adaptation of the CBT-AD intervention for HIV-infected women in rural areas of Alabama; 2) To systematically adapt the CBT-AD intervention to HIV-infected depressed women residing in rural Alabama and telemedicine technology, using an iterative open-label - non-randomized process; and 3) To assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the adapted CBT-AD in reducing depression and improving ART adherence and retention in care among HIV-infected depressed women via a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be recruited from three HIV care organizations serving 47 counties across Alabama, including 668 HIV-infected women in 2010. All sites are connected through telemedicine equipment facilitating the delivery of mental health service into rural areas in this proposal. The contribution of the proposed research is significant since it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lead to the development o therapies that meet the gender-specific, psychological and medical needs of HIV-infected women to improve adherence to ART and retention in care. The research proposed in this application is innovative because of: 1) Its focus on an understudied vulnerable population, namely HIV-infected women residing in the Deep South who have been shown to be economically disadvantaged and burdened by high rates of depression; 2) Its plan to culturally adapt an intervention that aims at decreasing depression morbidity and simultaneously increases retention and adherence to HIV care and 3) Its use of telemedicine technology, which will allow for barriers of access to care and mental health services to be addressed.          The proposed research is relevant to public health because it provides innovative solutions to obstacles related to antiretroviral therapy adherence and retention in care among HIV-infected women experiencing high rates of depression. Thus the proposed research directly meets the goals of the NIH's FY 2011 Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-related Research and the White House's National HIV/AIDS Strategy, which aim at reducing health disparities by studying interventions that impact adherence to HIV therapeutic regimens and medical care among HIV-infected women and girls. Furthermore it identifies the need for evaluating the impact of HIV- unrelated therapies and co-morbidities, including mental health disorders, on access to health care.

"Social Patterns and Pathways of HIV Care among HIV Positive Transgender Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that there are more than one million people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the United States and each year there are approximately 56,300 new cases of infection. Transgender women (TGW), (i.e.,biological men who live their lives as women), are at particularly high risk for HIV infection and HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Various studies indicate that TGW have the highest HIV prevalence rates of all gender and sexual minorities. However, research also shows that they are less likely to enter and be retained in HIV care. Consequently, they are more likely to suffer adverse health outcomes and infect others. Even once they know they are HIV-infected, TGW are also less likely than other sexual minorities, such as men who have sex with men and bisexual men, to enter HIV care. Historically, research on gender and sexual minorities has included the transgender population in the collective group of lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons. Recent recommendations by the Office of National AIDS Policy and the Institute of Medicine have cautioned that this combined approach has obscured the differences that exist within and between these populations, and has resulted in inadequate examination of the health needs and experiences of the transgender population. This study aims to address these concerns and will explore TGW's experiences of HIV health care utilization (seeking, entering, or being retained in care). Specifically, it will examine the role of social network factors on TGW's decisions to enter into and remain engaged in care and describe the social dynamics (processes) that undergird their use of HIV care throughout the course of their illness. Given the paucity of research with this population, a grounded theory approach will be used to explore how social network norms influence TGW's decisions about when, where, how, and if to seek HIV care, as well as the patterns and pathways through which they enter, progress through, and are retained in care. HIV/AIDS is one of the most critical public health crises confronting gender and sexual minorities, especially TGW. Findings from this study will facilitate a better understanding of the social factors that determine HIV health care utilization behaviors (entry into and retention in care) of TGW following an HIV diagnosis. In addition, this study will contribute to the state of the science of transgender health by expanding knowledge of health care inequalities and transgender-specific health needs, two priority areas outlined by the Institute of Medicine. Results from this study wil provide a strong foundation for establishing a program of research in gender and sexual minority health. Importantly, the results will also be used to educate health care professionals about the needs of HIV infected TGW and to inform the development of strategies to facilitate HIV health care utilization in this population.          Transgender women (biological men who identify as women) have the highest rates of HIV infection of all gender and sexual minorities, yet are less likely to receive HIV care. Relationships in the social support system and health care encounters within the treatment system influence an individual's decision to seek, enter, and remain engaged in care. This study will provide information that will help us understand the social patterns and pathways of HIV care use among TGW and will contribute to development of social and structural interventions to improve HIV care and health outcomes for transgender women with HIV.

"Medical Mistrust, Social Networks, and Disparities in HIV Care Among Blacks    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): African Americans with HIV fare worse than their White counterparts, with large racial/ethnic disparities at all points along the HIV care continuum. Compared to Whites with HIV, African Americans with HIV have lower levels of engagement and retention in care, and are less likely to be on state-of-the art antiretroviral treatment (ART); those on ART are less likely to be adherent at high enough levels for the treatment to be effective. The proposed 5-year project focuses on HIV-related medical mistrust (e.g., misconceptions, conspiracies such as that HIV is a form of genocide) as a barrier to HIV care and treatment behaviors. Specifically, the project will examine how social contexts, specifically, social networks (i.e., the constellation of social relationships surrounding an individual), may influence the spread of HIV-related medical mistrust, and in turn, affect treatment behaviors among African Americans with HIV. A total of 240 African Americans with HIV (120 not engaged in care, 120 on ART) will be followed over 12-months; data will be collected on the flow of HIV-related mistrust beliefs across social networks, as well as HIV care outcomes over time (engagement in care, adherence to ART). The research will conclude with active intervention conceptualization in partnership with community stakeholders in order to identify innovative social network-based solutions for improving treatment behaviors and ultimately, reducing disparities. The specific aims are: (1) To identify social network sources of HIV-related information (i.e., mistrust, misconceptions, conspiracies, and accurate information) among African Americans with HIV; (2) To examine the ways in which social network characteristics related to HIV mistrust are associated with HIV treatment behaviors across the HIV care continuum (engagement in care, antiretroviral treatment use, antiretroviral treatment adherence); and (3) Together with community stakeholders, to use study findings to identify novel intervention solutions to address mistrust and improve HIV treatment behaviors for African Americans with HIV. HIV-related mistrust is hypothesized to be spread through social networks and associated with specific network characteristics; individuals with high HIV-related mistrust are hypothesized to be less likely to be engaged in care and to be adherent to ART; and social network composition (e.g., level of mistrust in network) and structure (e.g., closeness of network members) are predicted to be related to HIV treatment behaviors (e.g., the relationship between mistrust and adherence will be greater for individuals in networks with high levels of mistrust). No research to date has used a social network approach to understanding the flow of HIV-related information and misconceptions among people with HIV.              PROJECT NARRATIVE  Large racial/ethnic disparities exist in HIV care, with African Americans less likely that Whites to be engaged in care, taking state-of-the art antiretroviral treatment (ART), and adherent to ART. Levels of HIV- related medical mistrust (including misconceptions, misinformation, and conspiracies, e.g., that HIV is a form of genocide) are high among African Americans and are thought to be a barrier to HIV care and treatment behaviors. We propose to examine how social contexts, specifically, social networks, may influence the spread of HIV-related mistrust, and in turn, affect HIV-related treatment behaviors across the HIV care continuum among African Americans with HIV.","Medical Mistrust, Social Networks, and Disparities in HIV Care Among Blacks",8462135,R01MD003964,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Interview ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Play ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Poisons ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Solutions ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Misinformation ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Source ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Network-based ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' treatment adherence ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2013,397925,0.22131502016738824
"Addressing Barriers to Retention in HIV Care for Hispanic Immigrants     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient engagement in HIV care encompasses a cascade of events from HIV diagnosis to retention in care. Each step is vital in achieving the goal of virologic suppression and improved health outcomes. Compromising this clinical imperative is the nearly 50% of HIV-infected individuals in the US who are not in continuous HIV care. The HIV epidemic poses a particularly severe problem in Hispanic populations. While Hispanics comprise 16% of the US population, they comprise 20% of new HIV infections. Immigrants make up 42% of new HIV diagnoses in Hispanics. Emerging interventions to improve retention in HIV care in the general HIV-infected population have not been adequately studied in Hispanic immigrants, a growing segment of the population where risk for poor outcomes is a precarious reality. Factors specific both to Hispanic cultures and to immigrant status are essential to highlight for effective intervention development. A better understanding of these factors could lead to improved, tailored approaches to retention in HIV care for Hispanic immigrants, improvement in health outcomes, and a reduction in ongoing HIV transmission. CANDIDATE: My specialized training in clinical infectious disease, public health, and Hispanic studies, coupled with extensive resources at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), uniquely position me to accomplish these aims. I have five peer-reviewed research articles directly related to HIV outcomes and the consequences of adherence to care in resource-limited settings, and extensive clinical experience caring for HIV-infected individuals as well as immigrants. RESEARCH: I will conduct formative qualitative research with Hispanic immigrants infected with HIV and their medical providers to understand factors (e.g. individual preferences, structural barriers) and agents (e.g. role of the family) that influence decision-making around retention in primary HIV care. I will give specific attention to generating novel intervention ideas to improve retention in HIV care through these in-depth interviews with patients and the multi-disciplinary providers within an HIV provider team including physicians, nurses, social workers, case managers, and community health workers (Aim 1). I will expand the Andersen Model of Health Services Use to include conceptual models of health disparities in order to evaluate societal, clinic/system- level, and individual determinants of HIV care utilization. Guided by this conceptual model, formative research, and community stakeholder feedback, we will identify the most significant and modifiable factors that determine retention in HIV care for the study population in order to inform the development of an intervention. We will develop and pilot test a culturally-tailored intervention (Aim 2). The intervention will target Hispanic immigrants who are not retained in HIV care, and for whom there are limited culturally relevant interventions. We will intervene at a particularly vulnerable period in the HIV care cascade, retention in care, where care interruption poses substantial consequences for both the individual, due to risk of clinical decline and risk-taking behaviors, and for public health, due threat of resulting HIV transmission. Standardization of the intervention will occur through iterative refinements based on participant and community advisory board feedback. Through a focused randomized pilot trial (Aim 3), we will further refine study procedures and perform preliminary power analyses in preparation for a larger, more definitive test of the intervention directed through submission of an R01 proposal at the end of the award. TRAINING/MENTORING: My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing culturally-tailored community-based interventions to improve outcomes in HIV and other chronic diseases for vulnerable populations. I will need rigorous training in methodologies that will enable me to fully capture factors, such as culture and context, and processes, such as acculturation, that influence use of HIV care for Hispanic immigrants. Training in community-engaged methods will facilitate effective development and deployment of novel interventions in the community setting. To complement my prior training in clinical care and HIV outcomes research, I have outlined a plan for intensive training in community-based participatory research, qualitative research, behavioral theory, and intervention development. This training will occur through graduate-level coursework as well as through intensive supervision with my mentors, who are internationally- recognized leaders in areas of research directly related to the proposal. My mentorship team also has a strong foothold in community-based partnerships for research and HIV care delivery in Massachusetts and nationally. Furthermore, this project advances the institutional strategic priorities of the CDC, NIMH and the Office of AIDS Research, notably, to reduce HIV health disparities and to improve medical care for people living with HIV. The successful completion of this research will position me as an expert in retention in care for HIV-infected Hispanic immigrants, and more generally will enable me to address challenges in vulnerable populations burdened with chronic illnesses that require innovative models for disease management.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of the 1.2 million HIV-infected individuals in the US, nearly 50% are not engaged in regular HIV care and 80% do not show viral load suppression, a marker of HIV treatment success. Among Hispanic patients with HIV, immigrants represent 40% of new HIV cases, an important public health disparity that reflects a confluence of ill-defined risks and barriers to health care. This Career Development Award will address the knowledge gap in barriers to retention in HIV care for Hispanic immigrants, and will leverage this information to develop and pilot test culturally-relevant approaches to improve retention in care, a critical yet underdeveloped area of public health research.                    ",Addressing Barriers to Retention in HIV Care for

"Connecting People, Places, and Barriers:  The Effect of These Connections on Adhe     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a trained health geographer with expertise in the areas of social-ecological models, neighborhood effects, and Geographic Information System, I am further interested in expanding my research foci in the interface of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS, both from methodological and intervention perspectives. To that end, in the upcoming five years of training, I will devote my time to focused research on multidimensional correlates to adherence, retention, and HIV treatment outcomes among infected drug users using system science techniques. The ultimate goal is to design interventions to improve HIV treatment outcomes among this vulnerable population. To achieve this goal, I will work with an internationally recognized group of mentors to obtain training in the epidemiology of substance use disorders, HIV transmission and treatment, social network analysis, and design of interventions. My specific objectives to achieve this career goal are: 1. Enhance my background and understanding of existing literature on behavioral and clinical interventions to  seek, test, treat, and retain in care among drug users with HIV infection. 2. A. Advance expertise in theory, visualization, and application of social network analysis, including  egocentric network, whole network, and longitudinal networks. Incorporate spatial dependency to  innovatively advance social network metrics to spatial-social network metrics.  B. Develop expertise in research methods necessary to design, perform, and evaluate randomized  controlled trials. 3. Gain experience in intervention development, testing, implementation, and dissemination that will address  multidimensional barriers to adherence and retention in care among HIV positive drug users. 4. Development of an independent career path in behavioral intervention-oriented research focused on the  intersection between substance abuse and HIV by successfully writing and receipt of a R01 grant.  Given the vital importance of mentoring in the process of training and career development, I have assembled a strong interdisciplinary panel of mentors and consultants who will provide guidance throughout my five years of advanced training. Dr. Frederick Altice will serve as my primary mentor (substance abuse, HIV, intervention), with Drs. Michael Copenhaver (HIV, intervention) and Carl Latkin (social network analysis, neighborhood effects, intervention) as co-mentors. I will further consult Drs. Ofer Harel for biostatistics, Lesie Snyder for health communication, and Michael Emch for geographical theories of health research. The training will provide opportunities to conduct two research projects for vulnerable drug users with HIV infection. Study 1: To inform the development of an intervention by examining multidimensional (individual- social-ecological) correlates of adherence to ART, retention in care, and HIV treatment outcomes among drug using HIV positive population. [Year 1, 2, 3 (Part)] This is a secondary analysis using data from a randomized controlled trial (Project STRIDE, Altice, R01 DA030768) and its 'Social Network and Neighborhood' Supplement. To this I add the following aims:  Specific Aim 1: Extend social network metrics (i.e., derived from network structure) to spatial-social metrics (based on both network structure and spatial proximity between subjects and their network members).  Specific Aim 2: Visualize and map the 'activity space' patterns of subjects in a Geographic Information Science interface, including visits to routine locations of positive and negative influence. This is significantly different tha the just the residential location of the subjects.  Specific Aim 3: Examine the combined effect of individual, social relationships, activity space, and neighborhood correlates of adherence to ART, retention, and HIV treatment outcomes modeled on a robust multidimensional social-ecological framework. Study 2: To develop and pilot a spatial-network driven intervention with short message services (SMS) that will optimize adherence to ART, retention in care, and HIV treatment outcomes for HIV positive drug users. [Year 3(Part), 4, 5]  Phase 1: Select social network members (or alters) who will have stronger effect on the subjects (or egos) adherence to ART, retention, and HIV treatment outcomes. Formative evaluations of ego's activity space and composition and features of their social networks from Study 1 will determine the selection protocol. Phase 2: Conduct a pilot to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacyof a novel spatial- network driven intervention with SMS. The intervention has three arms: 1) Ego in HIV care with two alters assigned highest Interaction Index value, living inside ego's activity space receiving SMS, 2) Egos in HIV care with two alters assigned highest Interaction Index values, living outside the activity space receiving SMS, and 3) Egos in HIV care with no intervention (observational arm).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: First, identify barriers to adherence, retention in care, and HIV treatment outcomes among drug users with HIV infection using a multidimensional (individual, social relationships, activity space, and neighborhoods) social- ecological framework. Second, using correlates from these dimensions (specifically geographic proximity and interaction with social network members) a spatial-network-driven intervention is developed to improve adherence and HIV treatment outcomes. These projects will address the critical retention component of HIV treatment cascade and reduce ""fall-offs"" among positive drug users.                ","Connecting People, Places, and Barriers:  The Effect of These Connections on Adhe",8730821,K01DA037794,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' 6,14-Ethenomorphinan-7-methanol, 17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-alpha-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4,5-epoxy-18,19-dihydro-3-hydroxy-6-methoxy-alpha-methyl-, (5alpha,7alpha(S))- ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Evaluating ART for All HIV Seropositives: Can it work with the hardest cases?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On World AIDS Day, December 1, 2011, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) announced a new policy that all HIV seropositives should be offered antiretroviral treatment (ART) regardless of CD4 cell count. The new policy was based primarily on ""treatment as prevention"" as a method for not only improving the health of people living with HIV who initiate ART early, but also as a means of reducing transmission of the virus. The NYCDOHMH set an ambitious goal for this new policy: by one year post HIV diagnosis, 80% of new HIV diagnoses will have reached viral suppression. There are over 3,400 new HIV infections occurring annually in NYC; recent data indicate 38% reached durable viral suppression in 2006-07 (i.e., all viral loads 400 copies/mL). The policy goal is ambitious, but if it were to be achieved, it would almost certainly lead to an ""AIDS-free generation"" - the central theme of the 2012 International AIDS Conference - in the city with the largest local HIV epidemic in the US. There are serious difficulties in achieving this policy goal, notably the persistent racial/ethnic disparities in HIV infection in the city, especially among African-Americans, and drug-related sexual transmission. The overarching purpose of this research is to provide multisystem data to evaluate the implementation of the policy and help determine the most efficient use of available resources for achieving the policy goal. The design and methods are informed by the ecological systems model, while the RE-AIM model guides the overall assessment of the implementation of the new policy. The study aims are: 1) to assess durable viral suppression (i.e., two consecutive viral load tests 400 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL of plasma) within 12 months of diagnosis among a) STD clinic cohort (N = 300) with problem substance use, and b) all new HIV diagnoses in NYC occurring during the project funding period (N=approximately 3,400/year); 2) to assess key indicators along the HIV treatment cascade among the STD clinic cohort as the percentage who (a) link to HIV care; (b) receive a recommendation to initiate ART; (c) initiate ART treatment; and (d) adhere to ART treatment; 3) to assess multisystem predictors of durable viral load suppression and other HIV treatment cascade indicators among the STD clinic cohort and cohort of all new HIV diagnoses in NYC, to include individual (e.g., race/ethnicity, substance use) and geospatial factors (e.g., socioeconomic conditions, social disorder, social cohesion, and spatial access to HIV-related healthcare); 4) to describe and contextualize quantitative outcomes in Aims 1-3 using STD cohort qualitative data; and 5) to describe the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of HIV treatment policies among HIV primary care providers. The endpoint of durable viral suppression increases  public health relevance as the primary indicator of HIV transmission risk. Data will be used to inform further implementation of the new policy, and in particular, to guide allocation of resources to reach the policy goal. Recommendations will be produced by a Collaborative Board comprised of community stakeholders and clinical researchers.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) has adopted a policy of offering anti- retroviral treatment (ART) to all newly diagnosed HIV seropositive persons, regardless of CD4 count, with a goal of reaching viral suppression in 80% of HIV seropositive persons within 12 months of diagnosis. If this ambitious policy goal can be achieved, it would be a major step towards an ""AIDS-free generation"" in the US city with the largest AIDS epidemic. The proposed research will evaluate the implementation of this policy, conducted in partnership with the DOHMH, and with recommendations for improvements informed through continuous feedback from a community collaborative board.            ",Evaluating ART for All HIV Seropositives: Can it work with the hardest cases?,8690817,R01DA035707,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Adoption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Life ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' cohesion ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Data ', ' International AIDS ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment adherence ', ' surveillance data ', ' ']",NIDA,ST.

"Social Patterns and Pathways of HIV Care among HIV Positive Transgender Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that there are more than one million people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the United States and each year there are approximately 56,300 new cases of infection. Transgender women (TGW), (i.e.,biological men who live their lives as women), are at particularly high risk for HIV infection and HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Various studies indicate that TGW have the highest HIV prevalence rates of all gender and sexual minorities. However, research also shows that they are less likely to enter and be retained in HIV care. Consequently, they are more likely to suffer adverse health outcomes and infect others. Even once they know they are HIV-infected, TGW are also less likely than other sexual minorities, such as men who have sex with men and bisexual men, to enter HIV care. Historically, research on gender and sexual minorities has included the transgender population in the collective group of lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons. Recent recommendations by the Office of National AIDS Policy and the Institute of Medicine have cautioned that this combined approach has obscured the differences that exist within and between these populations, and has resulted in inadequate examination of the health needs and experiences of the transgender population. This study aims to address these concerns and will explore TGW's experiences of HIV health care utilization (seeking, entering, or being retained in care). Specifically, it will examine the role of social network factors on TGW's decisions to enter into and remain engaged in care and describe the social dynamics (processes) that undergird their use of HIV care throughout the course of their illness. Given the paucity of research with this population, a grounded theory approach will be used to explore how social network norms influence TGW's decisions about when, where, how, and if to seek HIV care, as well as the patterns and pathways through which they enter, progress through, and are retained in care. HIV/AIDS is one of the most critical public health crises confronting gender and sexual minorities, especially TGW. Findings from this study will facilitate a better understanding of the social factors that determine HIV health care utilization behaviors (entry into and retention in care) of TGW following an HIV diagnosis. In addition, this study will contribute to the state of the science of transgender health by expanding knowledge of health care inequalities and transgender-specific health needs, two priority areas outlined by the Institute of Medicine. Results from this study wil provide a strong foundation for establishing a program of research in gender and sexual minority health. Importantly, the results will also be used to educate health care professionals about the needs of HIV infected TGW and to inform the development of strategies to facilitate HIV health care utilization in this population.          Transgender women (biological men who identify as women) have the highest rates of HIV infection of all gender and sexual minorities, yet are less likely to receive HIV care. Relationships in the social support system and health care encounters within the treatment system influence an individual's decision to seek, enter, and remain engaged in care.

"Test of an intervention to improve retention in HIV care after hospitalization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor retention in medical care is one of the primary reasons people die of HIV/AIDS today. Modern HIV treatment has transformed this deadly infection into a treatable chronic condition. There are no proven interventions to better retain people in HIV primary care. Hospitalized patients with HIV infection are at high risk for poor retention in care. A single or dual session intervention is essential for most patients out of care, because any patient who could be recruited into a multi-session intervention could likely be recruited back into primary care. Our team has been researching retention in HIV care for over 7 years. Using the information-motivation-behavioral skills model as a framework, our data indicate that among patients recently diagnosed with HIV infection, access to HIV primary care is affected by critical information gaps regarding the availability of care and treatment, limited motivation related to poor coping strategies and low trust in the healthcare system, and weak behavior skills reflected in low self-efficacy and social support around adherence to HIV care. These factors result in poor ability to navigate the health care system and remain in HIV care. We have developed a structured, theory-based, Patient Mentor Program. The Patient Mentor Program was developed to improve retention into HIV primary care by increasing patient knowledge about HIV and the care system, increasing self-efficacy, and promoting active self-management. In a one- time interaction at the Thomas Street Health Center, volunteer patient mentors greet new patients who are arriving for their intake visit to the clinic, guide them through the intake visit and support them. In our preliminary, quasi-experimental data, 88% of patients who had a patient mentor during that intake visit completed a physician visit within the next 90 days, compared to 78% of patients who did not have a mentor (p<.001). These effects remained significant after adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, and persisted into the 90-180 day interval after intake. We will test the efficacy of the TSHC patient mentor intervention in a 5-year randomized, controlled trial in 434 socio-economically and racially diverse HIV-infected patients hospitalized at Ben Taub General Hospital. We hypothesize that the intervention will meaningfully increase retention in HIV primary care after discharge compared to an attention control. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To test the efficacy of the patient mentor intervention on retention in HIV primary care after hospital discharge; 2) To test the efficacy of a patient mentor intervention on secondary outcomes that include health services use, health-related quality of life, and clinical outcomes; 3) To determine the mediating factors associated with response to the intervention, and the individual and system facilitators and barriers to retention in HIV primary care. This study addresses one of the most important challenges in HIV care today, i.e., expanding modern HIV treatment to all those in need, and may also impact race-based disparities in the health of people with HIV infection.   Poor retention in medical care is one of the primary reason people die of HIV/AIDS today. We have developed a structured, theory-based, Patient Mentor Program to improve retention into HIV primary care. We will test the efficacy of this patient mentor intervention in a 5-year randomized, controlled trial in more than 400 socio-economically and racially diverse HIV-infected patients hospitalized at Ben Taub General Hospital.

"The AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) represent a marginalized population with substantial disparities in health care access and outcomes. Since 1988, the AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) study has followed disadvantaged, predominantly African American HIV-infected and at-risk IDUs in a community-based observational cohort, providing important evidence on the natural and treated course of HIV among IDUs. We have characterized the rates and risk factors for incident HIV infection and for progression to AIDS or death, described patterns of risk behavior, and determined barriers to optimal HIV care. Since availability of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), optimal HIV care is now achieved by early HIV testing; prompt linkage to HIV care, timely initiation of ART, high adherence, retention in care, and prolonged virological suppression. Drug use may have detrimental effects at each stage of this HIV Care Continuum. Proposed is a multidisciplinary research agenda with the primary objective to continue the epidemiological, pathogenesis, behavioral, and clinical characterization of the evolving HIV epidemic among IDUs as they age and drug use patterns change. While the cohort has and continues to be a platform for an array of studies critical to addressing critical on HIV and drug use, this proposal emphasizes examination of IDUs' navigation of the HIV Care Continuum. We aim to characterize the dynamic nature of the Care Continuum and to identify the key determinants of successful navigation and the consequences of stagnation. Successful navigation entails consistent engagement in care with prompt ART initiation and prolonged viral suppression. In contrast, we introduce the concept of stagnation, incorporating navigation patterns involving a failure to progress and delayed or relapsing transitions through the Continuum. We will describe longitudinal navigation patterns, characterize the time required to transition through stages, and identify sociodemographic, behavioral, provider and neighborhood-level determinants of the primary navigation patterns. We hypothesize that less successful navigation (stagnation) in the Care Continuum will have serious clinical consequences, increasing the risk for both AIDS or non-AIDS events as well as death. The key impact of this aim is to illuminate mechanisms, identify modifiable risk factors, and provide novel insight to inform efficient and targeted intervention development to mitigate the consequences of less effective HIV care among IDUs. To achieve these aims, we continue biannual visits with interview, exam, and biospecimen collection supplemented by medical record review and registry linkage. ALIVE represents the minority, socially-marginalized population at highest risk for HIV progression and limited access to care in Baltimore and nationally. The ALIVE study remains well- positioned to address these emerging issues confronting aging HIV-infected IDUs, namely characterizing long- term outcomes and enhancing HIV care through improving navigation of the HIV Care Continuum.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal supports continuation of the AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) study which has followed disadvantaged, predominantly African American HIV-infected and at-risk injection drug users (IDUs) in a community-based cohort since 1988. ALIVE provides a platform for longitudinally measuring risk behavior, treatment outcomes, disease incidence and prevalence, and cause-specific mortality among aging HIV-infected IDUs while also supporting independently-funded investigations of HIV and drug use. Focusing on how IDUs' navigate the HIV Care Continuum, we aim to understand mechanisms, identify modifiable risk factors, and inform intervention development to improve the effectiveness of HIV care among IDUs.            ",The AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) Study,8597089,U01DA036297,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Baltimore ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Interview ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Effect of Peer Navigation and Contingency Management on Retention in HIV Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Consistent treatment with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral load (VL), prolonging life and improving quality of life for HIV+ persons. Suppressing VL benefits communities by reducing transmission to others. Mere availability of ART and care, however, is insufficient; the benefits of ART depend upon HIV+ persons' continuous visits to the health care provider, regular monitoring and regular delivery of medications, - known as retention in HIV care. In spite of national efforts, up to a quarter of HIV+ persons, especially low- income minorities, are out of care. Innovative interventions are therefore urgently needed to maximize engagement and retention in HIV care, self-reported adherence, as well as HIV-1 RNA viral load suppression. In pursuit of these aims, the proposed study will assess outcomes of the following interventions in comparison to usual care: 1) contingency management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that integrates both CM and PN (CA).  The interventions will then be implemented and evaluated in a fully powered Randomized Control Trial (RCT) using 1) contingency management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that integrates both CM and PN (CA).  to examine the effect of the interventions (CM and PN) compared to one another, to their combination (CA) and to usual care. A total of 660 inadequately retained individuals (165/group) will be recruited from publically-funded clinics providing HIV Care in Los Angeles County (LAC). These 495 intervention and 165 controls will be assessed through interviews, VL tests and electronic record review for HIV care visits. The evaluation will address retention in HIV care, use of ART medications, and viral load suppression outcomes, as well as intermediate variables, such as barriers to care, substance use, mental health, social support, self-efficacy, knowledge, stigma, and other factors that may affect the effectiveness of the intervention. We will also assess the costs of the intervention and potential cost savings from long-term intervention outcomes (cost offset and cost-effectiveness). If shown to be effective and cost-effective, this study could have substantial, widespread impact on both individual and public health in Los Angeles and other major metropolitan areas.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research strongly suggests that racial and ethnic disparities substantially and persistently affect retention in HIV care rates. In order to improve both individual and community HIV prevention and care outcomes, innovative interventions are urgently needed to target the underlying factors that contribute to these disparities in care. We therefore propose to evaluate the effectiveness of two distinct and promising cognitive behavioral strategy interventions: Peer Navigation (PN) and Contingency Management (CM), and their combination to optimize retention in HIV care among a vulnerable population of HIV+ individuals served by a safety net health care system that includes the second largest epicenter of HIV+ persons in

"Telemedicine to Improve Depression and Adherence in HIV+ Women in the Rural South     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression has been recognized as a strong predictor of HIV care non-adherence, and consequently of increased morbidity and mortality. HIV-infected women are disproportionally affected by co-morbid depression in comparison to HIV-infected men. However, interventions addressing the psychosocial needs of HIV-infected women, particularly in the rural Deep South of the United States where HIV prevalence remains high, are limited. To address this fundamental gap in HIV care of HIV-infected women, the long-term goal is to develop an effective intervention that significantly improves clinical outcomes in HIV-infected women by decreasing depression morbidity and simultaneously increasing both adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and retention in care. The objective of this application is to culturally adapt an established and effective cognitive- behavioral therapy for depression and antiretroviral therapy adherence (CBT-AD) and test its feasibility and acceptability to HIV care adherence among HIV-infected minority women living in the rural South of the US. Teleconferencing/telemedicine technology will be used to overcome structural barriers to health care access (e.g. transportation, access to mental health service providers) persistent in rural areas. To accomplish this objective, the specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To conduct formative research (i.e. focus groups, individual key informant interviews) among HIV-infected women and HIV care providers to inform the cultural adaptation of the CBT-AD intervention for HIV-infected women in rural areas of Alabama; 2) To systematically adapt the CBT-AD intervention to HIV-infected depressed women residing in rural Alabama and telemedicine technology, using an iterative open-label - non-randomized process; and 3) To assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the adapted CBT-AD in reducing depression and improving ART adherence and retention in care among HIV-infected depressed women via a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be recruited from three HIV care organizations serving 47 counties across Alabama, including 668 HIV-infected women in 2010. All sites are connected through telemedicine equipment facilitating the delivery of mental health service into rural areas in this proposal. The contribution of the proposed research is significant since it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lead to the development o therapies that meet the gender-specific, psychological and medical needs of HIV-infected women to improve adherence to ART and retention in care. The research proposed in this application is innovative because of: 1) Its focus on an understudied vulnerable population, namely HIV-infected women residing in the Deep South who have been shown to be economically disadvantaged and burdened by high rates of depression; 2) Its plan to culturally adapt an intervention that aims at decreasing depression morbidity and simultaneously increases retention and adherence to HIV care and 3) Its use of telemedicine technology, which will allow for barriers of access to care and mental health services to be addressed.          The proposed research is relevant to public health because it provides innovative solutions to obstacles related to antiretroviral therapy adherence and retention in care among HIV-infected women experiencing high rates of depression. Thus the proposed research directly meets the goals of the NIH's FY 2011 Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-related Research and the White House's National HIV/AIDS Strategy, which aim at reducing health disparities by studying interventions that impact adherence to HIV therapeutic regimens and medical care among HIV-infected women and girls. Furthermore it identifies the need for evaluating the impact of HIV- unrelated therapies and co-morbidities, including mental health disorders, on access to health care.

"Improving Retention in Care Among Postpartum HIV-infected Women in Mississippi     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a 5-year training and research program that will allow Dr. Aadia Rana to achieve her goal of becoming an independent patient-oriented investigator with expertise in HIV health services and health disparities, integrating research and public health practice. The proposed program will build on the candidate's prior experience in HIV clinical research by enhancing her skills in mixed methods, health services, and clinical trials research involving behavioral interventions. The training plan will take advantage of an exceptional mentoring team and institutional environment that involves close collaboration between Alpert Medical School of Brown University, the University of Mississippi Medical Center, and the Mississippi Department of Health. Postpartum minority HIV-infected women in the southern United States face substantial challenges in access and retention in HIV care. This novel research proposal utilizes a population-based approach in evaluating retention in care among postpartum minority women in the rural South, and integrates a mixed-methods approach to examine the socioeconomic, demographic, and structural determinants of retention in care in this vulnerable population. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To comprehensively describe linkage and retention to HIV care following delivery, and the socioeconomic, demographic and structural determinants of linking and retaining in HIV care among postpartum women in Mississippi; 2)To prospectively evaluate the cascade of diagnosis, linkage, and retention in HIV medical care and the socioeconomic, psychosocial, and structural determinants of linking and retaining in HIV care among postpartum HIV-infected women in Mississippi; 3) To characterize the psychosocial facilitators and barriers to successful linkage and retention to care following delivery using qualitative methods. We will then incorporate the results of all of these studies in a future trial piloting an intervention integrating clinic and public health systems aimed at improving retention in HIV care among perinatal HIV-infected in Mississippi. This research will lay the groundwork for a larger research program on HIV care that will include rigorous evaluation of interventions aimed at improving the delivery of HIV care in disadvantaged populations with consideration for cost-effectiveness.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will lead to an increased understanding of retention in care among postpartum minority women in the rural South. Improving linkage and retention to care following delivery will have significan impact on the success of the treatment as prevention strategy to decrease incidence of HIV infection and impact medical outcomes for women who experience disparities in access to care in the South. The objectives of this mixed methods research project are in line with the trans- NIH goal of reducing new HIV infections, addressing health disparities in HIV care, and improving outcomes for patients with HIV.                ",Improving Retention in Care Among Postpartum HIV-infected Women in Mississippi,8659724,K23MH100955,"['lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mississippi ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Effect of Peer Navigation and Contingency Management on Retention in HIV Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Consistent treatment with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral load (VL), prolonging life and improving quality of life for HIV+ persons. Suppressing VL benefits communities by reducing transmission to others. Mere availability of ART and care, however, is insufficient; the benefits of ART depend upon HIV+ persons' continuous visits to the health care provider, regular monitoring and regular delivery of medications, - known as retention in HIV care. In spite of national efforts, up to a quarter of HIV+ persons, especially low- income minorities, are out of care. Innovative interventions are therefore urgently needed to maximize engagement and retention in HIV care, self-reported adherence, as well as HIV-1 RNA viral load suppression. In pursuit of these aims, the proposed study will assess outcomes of the following interventions in comparison to usual care: 1) contingency management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that integrates both CM and PN (CA).  The interventions will then be implemented and evaluated in a fully powered Randomized Control Trial (RCT) using 1) contingency management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that integrates both CM and PN (CA).  to examine the effect of the interventions (CM and PN) compared to one another, to their combination (CA) and to usual care. A total of 660 inadequately retained individuals (165/group) will be recruited from publically-funded clinics providing HIV Care in Los Angeles County (LAC). These 495 intervention and 165 controls will be assessed through interviews, VL tests and electronic record review for HIV care visits. The evaluation will address retention in HIV care, use of ART medications, and viral load suppression outcomes, as well as intermediate variables, such as barriers to care, substance use, mental health, social support, self-efficacy, knowledge, stigma, and other factors that may affect the effectiveness of the intervention. We will also assess the costs of the intervention and potential cost savings from long-term intervention outcomes (cost offset and cost-effectiveness). If shown to be effective and cost-effective, this study could have substantial, widespread impact on both individual and public health in Los Angeles and other major metropolitan areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research strongly suggests that racial and ethnic disparities substantially and persistently affect retention in HIV care rates. In order to improve both individual and community HIV prevention and care outcomes, innovative interventions are urgently needed to target the underlying factors that contribute to these disparities in care. We therefore propose to evaluate the effectiveness of two distinct and promising cognitive behavioral strategy interventions: Peer Navigation (PN) and Contingency Management (CM), and their combination to optimize retention in HIV care among a vulnerable population of HIV+ individuals served by a safety net health care system that includes the second largest epicenter of HIV+ persons in

"Connecting People, Places, and Barriers:  The Effect of These Connections on Adhe DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a trained health geographer with expertise in the areas of social-ecological models, neighborhood effects, and Geographic Information System, I am further interested in expanding my research foci in the interface of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS, both from methodological and intervention perspectives. To that end, in the upcoming five years of training, I will devote my time to focused research on multidimensional correlates to adherence, retention, and HIV treatment outcomes among infected drug users using system science techniques. The ultimate goal is to design interventions to improve HIV treatment outcomes among this vulnerable population. To achieve this goal, I will work with an internationally recognized group of mentors to obtain training in the epidemiology of substance use disorders, HIV transmission and treatment, social network analysis, and design of interventions. My specific objectives to achieve this career goal are: 1. Enhance my background and understanding of existing literature on behavioral and clinical interventions to  seek, test, treat, and retain in care among drug users with HIV infection. 2. A. Advance expertise in theory, visualization, and application of social network analysis, including  egocentric network, whole network, and longitudinal networks. Incorporate spatial dependency to  innovatively advance social network metrics to spatial-social network metrics.  B. Develop expertise in research methods necessary to design, perform, and evaluate randomized  controlled trials. 3. Gain experience in intervention development, testing, implementation, and dissemination that will address  multidimensional barriers to adherence and retention in care among HIV positive drug users. 4. Development of an independent career path in behavioral intervention-oriented research focused on the  intersection between substance abuse and HIV by successfully writing and receipt of a R01 grant.  Given the vital importance of mentoring in the process of training and career development, I have assembled a strong interdisciplinary panel of mentors and consultants who will provide guidance throughout my five years of advanced training. Dr. Frederick Altice will serve as my primary mentor (substance abuse, HIV, intervention), with Drs. Michael Copenhaver (HIV, intervention) and Carl Latkin (social network analysis, neighborhood effects, intervention) as co-mentors. I will further consult Drs. Ofer Harel for biostatistics, Lesie Snyder for health communication, and Michael Emch for geographical theories of health research. The training will provide opportunities to conduct two research projects for vulnerable drug users with HIV infection. Study 1: To inform the development of an intervention by examining multidimensional (individual- social-ecological) correlates of adherence to ART, retention in care, and HIV treatment outcomes among drug using HIV positive population. [Year 1, 2, 3 (Part)] This is a secondary analysis using data from a randomized controlled trial (Project STRIDE, Altice, R01 DA030768) and its 'Social Network and Neighborhood' Supplement. To this I add the following aims:  Specific Aim 1: Extend social network metrics (i.e., derived from network structure) to spatial-social metrics (based on both network structure and spatial proximity between subjects and their network members).  Specific Aim 2: Visualize and map the 'activity space' patterns of subjects in a Geographic Information Science interface, including visits to routine locations of positive and negative influence. This is significantly different tha the just the residential location of the subjects.  Specific Aim 3: Examine the combined effect of individual, social relationships, activity space, and neighborhood correlates of adherence to ART, retention, and HIV treatment outcomes modeled on a robust multidimensional social-ecological framework. Study 2: To develop and pilot a spatial-network driven intervention with short message services (SMS) that will optimize adherence to ART, retention in care, and HIV treatment outcomes for HIV positive drug users. [Year 3(Part), 4, 5]  Phase 1: Select social network members (or alters) who will have stronger effect on the subjects (or egos) adherence to ART, retention, and HIV treatment outcomes. Formative evaluations of ego's activity space and composition and features of their social networks from Study 1 will determine the selection protocol. Phase 2: Conduct a pilot to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacyof a novel spatial- network driven intervention with SMS. The intervention has three arms: 1) Ego in HIV care with two alters assigned highest Interaction Index value, living inside ego's activity space receiving SMS, 2) Egos in HIV care with two alters assigned highest Interaction Index values, living outside the activity space receiving SMS, and 3) Egos in HIV care with no intervention (observational arm). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: First, identify barriers to adherence, retention in care, and HIV treatment outcomes among drug users with HIV infection using a multidimensional (individual, social relationships, activity space, and neighborhoods) social- ecological framework. Second, using correlates from these dimensions (specifically geographic proximity and interaction with social network members) a spatial-network-driven intervention is developed to improve adherence and HIV treatment outcomes. These projects will address the critical retention component of HIV treatment cascade and reduce ""fall-offs"" among positive drug users.","Connecting People, Places, and Barriers:  The Effect of These Connections on Adhe",8896708,K01DA037794,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' 6,14-Ethenomorphinan-7-methanol, 17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-alpha-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4,5-epoxy-18,19-dihydro-3-hydroxy-6-methoxy-alpha-methyl-, (5alpha,7alpha(S))- ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Improving engagement in HIV care for high-risk women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender women (assigned `male' at birth but who do not identify as male) are disproportionately impacted by HIV and have culturally unique barriers and facilitators to engagement in HIV care. Transgender women living with HIV (TWH) are less likely than others to take antiretroviral therapy (ART), and those who initiate ART have lower rates of ART adherence, lower self-efficacy for integrating ART into daily routines, and report fewer positive interactions with health care providers than non-transgender adults. As a result, TWH have an almost three-fold higher viral load than non-transgender adults in San Francisco; in Los Angeles, TWH are less likely to be virally suppressed than any other behavioral risk group. In our formative work, we have identified culturally-specific and modifiable barriers to HIV treatment engagement among TWH, including prioritization of transition-related health care (i.e. hormone therapy) at the expense of HIV treatment, avoidance of HIV care settings due to past negative health care experiences, misinformation about ART including potential drug interactions with hormones, intensified HIV stigma, low levels of social support, and poor coping skills. There are both individual and public health consequences to poor engagement in care among TWH stemming from high transmission risk factors, including substance abuse, high numbers of sex partners, engagement in sex work, and high rates of mental illness. These findings strongly suggest that TWH face unique challenges to engaging in and adhering to HIV treatment, and that the public health consequences for poor engagement in this population are of grave concern. Interventions to mitigate these barriers to engagement in care are critical in efforts to alter the pattern of HIV-related disparities that lead to disproportionately poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable and marginalized population. We propose a randomized controlled trial of a theory- driven, population-specific, piloted intervention to improve engagement in care for TWH. Grounded in the investigators' Models of Gender Affirmation and Health Care Empowerment, the proposed research is the first to systematically intervene on complex barriers to optimal engagement in HIV care for TWH. We have developed and piloted the Healthy Divas intervention to optimize engagement in HIV care for TWH at elevated risk for treatment failure and consequential morbidity, mortality, and transmission of HIV.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed trial is grounded in a novel transgender-specific framework and is the culmination of years of work in a community at heightened risk for HIV treatment failure and transmission of HIV to others. If effective, the proposed intervention approach has the potential to optimize health outcomes in a population highly burdened by HIV while preventing further transmission.                ",Improving engagement in HIV care for high-risk women,8992854,R01MH106373,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Appointment ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Critical Care ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' indexing ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' male ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Silicones ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Misinformation ', ' Coping Skills ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Shelter facility ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' uptake ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Life ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' transsexual ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' health care model ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' virus load ', ' Viral load measurement ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' trial comparing ', ' stem ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' primary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' intervention effect ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,955346,0.1988959647999412
"Development of a Couple-Based Mobile Health Intervention for Enhancing HIV Care Engagement Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to other racial/ethnic groups in the US, Black men who have sex with men (MSM), once diagnosed, are less likely to be optimally engaged in HIV care and treatment. This undermines the promise of recent prevention approaches for reducing the disproportionate effects of HIV/AIDS on Black communities, emphasizing the urgency for increased research focus and intervention development. Understanding HIV care engagement in the context of the dyad may be part of a comprehensive effort to addressing multilevel influences on HIV care engagement outcomes that are unique to HIV+ Black MSM towards achieving the maximum public health benefit of treatment-as-prevention. However, the scarcity of dyad-level research limits our understanding of couple dynamics involved in HIV care engagement to inform intervention development targeting the couple, underscoring the need for couple-based studies of relational dynamics important to the HIV care engagement of the HIV+ partner(s). Mobile technology-based strategies (mHealth) offer tremendous potential as an acceptable, feasible, and effective intervention platform for enhancing HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black MSM in couples by facilitating couple dynamics optimal to HIV care engagement. Further, mHealth offers potential in addressing limitations in previous intervention research with couples, one of which is the dissipation of intervention effects over time due to absence of booster sessions. Therefore, the aims of the study are to: elucidate the effects of couple dynamics on HIV care engagement among partnered synthesize the quantitative and qualitative (mixed methods) outcomes from Aim 1 to identify the issues the intervention will target, and to iteratively determine core components of a couple-based intervention for HIV+ Black MSM (Aim 2); and develop a novel, technology-based intervention prototype for enhancing HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black MSM in couples (Aim 3). HIV+ Black MSM (Aim 1); The overall objective of this application is to achieve a better understanding of the couple dynamics involved in HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black men in same-sex relationships. The end goal is the development of an mHealth tool that targets couple dynamics important to enhancing HIV care engagement. Through these aims, I will acquire additional training necessary for my career development in (a) theory and mixed methods for conducting couple-based research, (b) formative research in intervention development, and (c) prototype design.

"Improving Retention in Care Among Postpartum HIV-infected Women in Mississippi DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a 5-year training and research program that will allow Dr. Aadia Rana to achieve her goal of becoming an independent patient-oriented investigator with expertise in HIV health services and health disparities, integrating research and public health practice. The proposed program will build on the candidate's prior experience in HIV clinical research by enhancing her skills in mixed methods, health services, and clinical trials research involving behavioral interventions. The training plan will take advantage of an exceptional mentoring team and institutional environment that involves close collaboration between Alpert Medical School of Brown University, the University of Mississippi Medical Center, and the Mississippi Department of Health. Postpartum minority HIV-infected women in the southern United States face substantial challenges in access and retention in HIV care. This novel research proposal utilizes a population-based approach in evaluating retention in care among postpartum minority women in the rural South, and integrates a mixed-methods approach to examine the socioeconomic, demographic, and structural determinants of retention in care in this vulnerable population. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To comprehensively describe linkage and retention to HIV care following delivery, and the socioeconomic, demographic and structural determinants of linking and retaining in HIV care among postpartum women in Mississippi; 2)To prospectively evaluate the cascade of diagnosis, linkage, and retention in HIV medical care and the socioeconomic, psychosocial, and structural determinants of linking and retaining in HIV care among postpartum HIV-infected women in Mississippi; 3) To characterize the psychosocial facilitators and barriers to successful linkage and retention to care following delivery using qualitative methods. We will then incorporate the results of all of these studies in a future trial piloting an intervention integrating clinic and public health systems aimed at improving retention in HIV care among perinatal HIV-infected in Mississippi. This research will lay the groundwork for a larger research program on HIV care that will include rigorous evaluation of interventions aimed at improving the delivery of HIV care in disadvantaged populations with consideration for cost-effectiveness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will lead to an increased understanding of retention in care among postpartum minority women in the rural South. Improving linkage and retention to care following delivery will have significan impact on the success of the treatment as prevention strategy to decrease incidence of HIV infection and impact medical outcomes for women who experience disparities in access to care in the South. The objectives of this mixed methods research project are in line with the trans- NIH goal of reducing new HIV infections, addressing health disparities in HIV care, and improving outcomes for patients with HIV.",Improving Retention in Care Among Postpartum HIV-infected Women in Mississippi,8871795,K23MH100955,"['lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mississippi ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Addressing Barriers to Retention in HIV Care for Hispanic Immigrants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient engagement in HIV care encompasses a cascade of events from HIV diagnosis to retention in care. Each step is vital in achieving the goal of virologic suppression and improved health outcomes. Compromising this clinical imperative is the nearly 50% of HIV-infected individuals in the US who are not in continuous HIV care. The HIV epidemic poses a particularly severe problem in Hispanic populations. While Hispanics comprise 16% of the US population, they comprise 20% of new HIV infections. Immigrants make up 42% of new HIV diagnoses in Hispanics. Emerging interventions to improve retention in HIV care in the general HIV-infected population have not been adequately studied in Hispanic immigrants, a growing segment of the population where risk for poor outcomes is a precarious reality. Factors specific both to Hispanic cultures and to immigrant status are essential to highlight for effective intervention development. A better understanding of these factors could lead to improved, tailored approaches to retention in HIV care for Hispanic immigrants, improvement in health outcomes, and a reduction in ongoing HIV transmission. CANDIDATE: My specialized training in clinical infectious disease, public health, and Hispanic studies, coupled with extensive resources at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), uniquely position me to accomplish these aims. I have five peer-reviewed research articles directly related to HIV outcomes and the consequences of adherence to care in resource-limited settings, and extensive clinical experience caring for HIV-infected individuals as well as immigrants. RESEARCH: I will conduct formative qualitative research with Hispanic immigrants infected with HIV and their medical providers to understand factors (e.g. individual preferences, structural barriers) and agents (e.g. role of the family) that influence decision-making around retention in primary HIV care. I will give specific attention to generating novel intervention ideas to improve retention in HIV care through these in-depth interviews with patients and the multi-disciplinary providers within an HIV provider team including physicians, nurses, social workers, case managers, and community health workers (Aim 1). I will expand the Andersen Model of Health Services Use to include conceptual models of health disparities in order to evaluate societal, clinic/system- level, and individual determinants of HIV care utilization. Guided by this conceptual model, formative research, and community stakeholder feedback, we will identify the most significant and modifiable factors that determine retention in HIV care for the study population in order to inform the development of an intervention. We will develop and pilot test a culturally-tailored intervention (Aim 2). The intervention will target Hispanic immigrants who are not retained in HIV care, and for whom there are limited culturally relevant interventions. We will intervene at a particularly vulnerable period in the HIV care cascade, retention in care, where care interruption poses substantial consequences for both the individual, due to risk of clinical decline and risk-taking behaviors, and for public health, due threat of resulting HIV transmission. Standardization of the intervention will occur through iterative refinements based on participant and community advisory board feedback. Through a focused randomized pilot trial (Aim 3), we will further refine study procedures and perform preliminary power analyses in preparation for a larger, more definitive test of the intervention directed through submission of an R01 proposal at the end of the award. TRAINING/MENTORING: My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing culturally-tailored community-based interventions to improve outcomes in HIV and other chronic diseases for vulnerable populations. I will need rigorous training in methodologies that will enable me to fully capture factors, such as culture and context, and processes, such as acculturation, that influence use of HIV care for Hispanic immigrants. Training in community-engaged methods will facilitate effective development and deployment of novel interventions in the community setting. To complement my prior training in clinical care and HIV outcomes research, I have outlined a plan for intensive training in community-based participatory research, qualitative research, behavioral theory, and intervention development. This training will occur through graduate-level coursework as well as through intensive supervision with my mentors, who are internationally- recognized leaders in areas of research directly related to the proposal. My mentorship team also has a strong foothold in community-based partnerships for research and HIV care delivery in Massachusetts and nationally. Furthermore, this project advances the institutional strategic priorities of the CDC, NIMH and the Office of AIDS Research, notably, to reduce HIV health disparities and to improve medical care for people living with HIV. The successful completion of this research will position me as an expert in retention in care for HIV-infected Hispanic immigrants, and more generally will enable me to address challenges in vulnerable populations burdened with chronic illnesses that require innovative models for disease management. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of the 1.2 million HIV-infected individuals in the US, nearly 50% are not engaged in regular HIV care and 80% do not show viral load suppression, a marker of HIV treatment success. Among Hispanic patients with HIV, immigrants represent 40% of new HIV cases, an important public health disparity that reflects a confluence of ill-defined risks and barriers to health care. This Career Development Award will address the knowledge gap in barriers to retention in HIV care for Hispanic immigrants, and will leverage this information to develop and pilot test culturally-relevant approaches to improve retention in care, a critical yet underdeveloped area of public health research.",Addressing Barriers to Retention in HIV Care for Hispanic

"Evaluating ART for All HIV Seropositives: Can it work with the hardest cases? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On World AIDS Day, December 1, 2011, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) announced a new policy that all HIV seropositives should be offered antiretroviral treatment (ART) regardless of CD4 cell count. The new policy was based primarily on ""treatment as prevention"" as a method for not only improving the health of people living with HIV who initiate ART early, but also as a means of reducing transmission of the virus. The NYCDOHMH set an ambitious goal for this new policy: by one year post HIV diagnosis, 80% of new HIV diagnoses will have reached viral suppression. There are over 3,400 new HIV infections occurring annually in NYC; recent data indicate 38% reached durable viral suppression in 2006-07 (i.e., all viral loads 400 copies/mL). The policy goal is ambitious, but if it were to be achieved, it would almost certainly lead to an ""AIDS-free generation"" - the central theme of the 2012 International AIDS Conference - in the city with the largest local HIV epidemic in the US. There are serious difficulties in achieving this policy goal, notably the persistent racial/ethnic disparities in HIV infection in the city, especially among African-Americans, and drug-related sexual transmission. The overarching purpose of this research is to provide multisystem data to evaluate the implementation of the policy and help determine the most efficient use of available resources for achieving the policy goal. The design and methods are informed by the ecological systems model, while the RE-AIM model guides the overall assessment of the implementation of the new policy. The study aims are: 1) to assess durable viral suppression (i.e., two consecutive viral load tests 400 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL of plasma) within 12 months of diagnosis among a) STD clinic cohort (N = 300) with problem substance use, and b) all new HIV diagnoses in NYC occurring during the project funding period (N=approximately 3,400/year); 2) to assess key indicators along the HIV treatment cascade among the STD clinic cohort as the percentage who (a) link to HIV care; (b) receive a recommendation to initiate ART; (c) initiate ART treatment; and (d) adhere to ART treatment; 3) to assess multisystem predictors of durable viral load suppression and other HIV treatment cascade indicators among the STD clinic cohort and cohort of all new HIV diagnoses in NYC, to include individual (e.g., race/ethnicity, substance use) and geospatial factors (e.g., socioeconomic conditions, social disorder, social cohesion, and spatial access to HIV-related healthcare); 4) to describe and contextualize quantitative outcomes in Aims 1-3 using STD cohort qualitative data; and 5) to describe the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of HIV treatment policies among HIV primary care providers. The endpoint of durable viral suppression increases public health relevance as the primary indicator of HIV transmission risk. Data will be used to inform further implementation of the new policy, and in particular, to guide allocation of resources to reach the policy goal. Recommendations will be produced by a Collaborative Board comprised of community stakeholders and clinical researchers.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) has adopted a policy of offering anti- retroviral treatment (ART) to all newly diagnosed HIV seropositive persons, regardless of CD4 count, with a goal of reaching viral suppression in 80% of HIV seropositive persons within 12 months of diagnosis. If this ambitious policy goal can be achieved, it would be a major step towards an ""AIDS-free generation"" in the US city with the largest AIDS epidemic. The proposed research will evaluate the implementation of this policy, conducted in partnership with the DOHMH, and with recommendations for improvements informed through continuous feedback from a community collaborative board.",Evaluating ART for All HIV Seropositives: Can it work with the hardest cases?,8816068,R01DA035707,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Adoption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Life ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' cohesion ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Data ', ' International AIDS ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment adherence ', ' surveillance data ', ' ']",NIDA,ST.

"Using Biomarkers to Understand the HIV Epidemic in a Community Sample of Black MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are disproportionately burdened with new and existing HIV infection. This is largely attributable to disparities in the HIV care continuum, a multistage care model that starts with diagnosis, is followed by linkage and retention in care, requires the prescription of and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and ends with viral suppression. Not only does the last stage represent control of HIV disease necessary for the health of individuals, it also makes possible the virtual elimination of sexual transmission of HIV infection to others; disparities in HIV treatment are disparities in HIV prevention. Supplementing behavioral data with information on CD4 count, ART use, and viral suppression are needed since these are biological markers of the care continuum that influence infection dynamics. We are currently collecting a random sample of BMSM attending Black Pride events (the ""Black Pride study,"" R01NR013865, PI: Stall) to understand factors associated with continuum disparities. Recent scientific advances suggest the need to enhance behavioral research with biological markers. Self-report may misclassify unknown HIV infection among BMSM; two studies demonstrate many who would have otherwise been classified as having unknown infection actually had detectable levels of ART or were virally suppressed. We may be inefficiently investing resources if diagnosis is not the continuum stage driving disparities. We must also explore the extent to which self-report may misclassify BMSM in other stages of the HIV care continuum. With these findings, and our theoretical framework, we hypothesize that the same factors that inhibit viral suppression (e.g., syndemic production, HIV stigma) are the same that influence discordance between self-report and biological data. We propose the use of dried blood spot (DBS) lab techniques to analyze CD4, ART, and viral load by collecting minute quantities of blood from BMSM. This study will address the following three Specific Aims:(1) Examine differences in operationalizing HIV care continuum position using self-report and biological data, (2) Explore HIV care continuum position and associated factors using a combination of behavioral and biological outcome data, and (3) Describe acceptability of using DBS in a community sample of BMSM. Completion of these aims will generate the most comprehensive understanding of the care continuum among BMSM to date, and will help inform best practices for research endeavors that seek to employ a combination of behavioral and biological data. This research will maximize intervention success for BMSM by allowing for the confident identification, and consequently the ability to target, sources of HIV disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is relevant to both public health practice and science for two primary reasons. First, the combination of biological outcome data with a detailed behavioral questionnaire will greatly enhance our understanding of the HIV care continuum among Black MSM.

"Development of a Couple-Based Mobile Health Intervention for Enhancing HIV Care Engagement Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to other racial/ethnic groups in the US, Black men who have sex with men (MSM), once diagnosed, are less likely to be optimally engaged in HIV care and treatment. This undermines the promise of recent prevention approaches for reducing the disproportionate effects of HIV/AIDS on Black communities, emphasizing the urgency for increased research focus and intervention development. Understanding HIV care engagement in the context of the dyad may be part of a comprehensive effort to addressing multilevel influences on HIV care engagement outcomes that are unique to HIV+ Black MSM towards achieving the maximum public health benefit of treatment-as-prevention. However, the scarcity of dyad-level research limits our understanding of couple dynamics involved in HIV care engagement to inform intervention development targeting the couple, underscoring the need for couple-based studies of relational dynamics important to the HIV care engagement of the HIV+ partner(s). Mobile technology-based strategies (mHealth) offer tremendous potential as an acceptable, feasible, and effective intervention platform for enhancing HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black MSM in couples by facilitating couple dynamics optimal to HIV care engagement. Further, mHealth offers potential in addressing limitations in previous intervention research with couples, one of which is the dissipation of intervention effects over time due to absence of booster sessions. Therefore, the aims of the study are to: elucidate the effects of couple dynamics on HIV care engagement among partnered synthesize the quantitative and qualitative (mixed methods) outcomes from Aim 1 to identify the issues the intervention will target, and to iteratively determine core components of a couple-based intervention for HIV+ Black MSM (Aim 2); and develop a novel, technology-based intervention prototype for enhancing HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black MSM in couples (Aim 3). HIV+ Black MSM (Aim 1); The overall objective of this application is to achieve a better understanding of the couple dynamics involved in HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black men in same-sex relationships. The end goal is the development of an mHealth tool that targets couple dynamics important to enhancing HIV care engagement. Through these aims, I will acquire additional training necessary for my career development in (a) theory and mixed methods for conducting couple-based research, (b) formative research in intervention development, and (c) prototype design. These research and career development activities will build the foundation to my becoming an independent, NIH-funded investigator with skills to conduct couple-based intervention research that is part of a comprehensive effort in HIV prevention integrating advances in technology and behavioral medicine to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV/AIDS among Black men is a US public health crisis, emphasizing the urgency for increased research focus and intervention development. The overall objective of this application is to achieve a better understanding of the couple dynamics involved in HIV care engagement among partnered HIV+ Black men.

"Effect of Peer Navigation and Contingency Management on Retention in HIV Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Consistent treatment with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral load (VL), prolonging life and improving quality of life for HIV+ persons. Suppressing VL benefits communities by reducing transmission to others. Mere availability of ART and care, however, is insufficient; the benefits of ART depend upon HIV+ persons' continuous visits to the health care provider, regular monitoring and regular delivery of medications, - known as retention in HIV care. In spite of national efforts, up to a quarter of HIV+ persons, especially low- income minorities, are out of care. Innovative interventions are therefore urgently needed to maximize engagement and retention in HIV care, self-reported adherence, as well as HIV-1 RNA viral load suppression. In pursuit of these aims, the proposed study will assess outcomes of the following interventions in comparison to usual care: 1) contingency management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that integrates both CM and PN (CA).  The interventions will then be implemented and evaluated in a fully powered Randomized Control Trial (RCT) using 1) contingency management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that integrates both CM and PN (CA).  to examine the effect of the interventions (CM and PN) compared to one another, to their combination (CA) and to usual care. A total of 660 inadequately retained individuals (165/group) will be recruited from publically-funded clinics providing HIV Care in Los Angeles County (LAC). These 495 intervention and 165 controls will be assessed through interviews, VL tests and electronic record review for HIV care visits. The evaluation will address retention in HIV care, use of ART medications, and viral load suppression outcomes, as well as intermediate variables, such as barriers to care, substance use, mental health, social support, self-efficacy, knowledge, stigma, and other factors that may affect the effectiveness of the intervention. We will also assess the costs of the intervention and potential cost savings from long-term intervention outcomes (cost offset and cost-effectiveness). If shown to be effective and cost-effective, this study could have substantial, widespread impact on both individual and public health in Los Angeles and other major metropolitan areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research strongly suggests that racial and ethnic disparities substantially and persistently affect retention in HIV care rates. In order to improve both individual and community HIV prevention and care outcomes, innovative interventions are urgently needed to target the underlying factors that contribute to these disparities in care. We therefore propose to evaluate the effectiveness of two distinct and promising cognitive behavioral strategy interventions: Peer Navigation (PN) and Contingency Management (CM), and their combination to optimize retention in HIV care among a vulnerable population of HIV+ individuals served by a safety net health care system that includes the second largest epicenter of HIV+ persons in

"Using Biomarkers to Understand the HIV Epidemic in a Community Sample of Black MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are disproportionately burdened with new and existing HIV infection. This is largely attributable to disparities in the HIV care continuum, a multistage care model that starts with diagnosis, is followed by linkage and retention in care, requires the prescription of and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and ends with viral suppression. Not only does the last stage represent control of HIV disease necessary for the health of individuals, it also makes possible the virtual elimination of sexual transmission of HIV infection to others; disparities in HIV treatment are disparities in HIV prevention. Supplementing behavioral data with information on CD4 count, ART use, and viral suppression are needed since these are biological markers of the care continuum that influence infection dynamics. We are currently collecting a random sample of BMSM attending Black Pride events (the ""Black Pride study,"" R01NR013865, PI: Stall) to understand factors associated with continuum disparities. Recent scientific advances suggest the need to enhance behavioral research with biological markers. Self-report may misclassify unknown HIV infection among BMSM; two studies demonstrate many who would have otherwise been classified as having unknown infection actually had detectable levels of ART or were virally suppressed. We may be inefficiently investing resources if diagnosis is not the continuum stage driving disparities. We must also explore the extent to which self-report may misclassify BMSM in other stages of the HIV care continuum. With these findings, and our theoretical framework, we hypothesize that the same factors that inhibit viral suppression (e.g., syndemic production, HIV stigma) are the same that influence discordance between self-report and biological data. We propose the use of dried blood spot (DBS) lab techniques to analyze CD4, ART, and viral load by collecting minute quantities of blood from BMSM. This study will address the following three Specific Aims:(1) Examine differences in operationalizing HIV care continuum position using self-report and biological data, (2) Explore HIV care continuum position and associated factors using a combination of behavioral and biological outcome data, and (3) Describe acceptability of using DBS in a community sample of BMSM. Completion of these aims will generate the most comprehensive understanding of the care continuum among BMSM to date, and will help inform best practices for research endeavors that seek to employ a combination of behavioral and biological data. This research will maximize intervention success for BMSM by allowing for the confident identification, and consequently the ability to target, sources of HIV disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is relevant to both public health practice and science for two primary reasons.

"mHealth for ART adherence by HIV+ African Americans age 45 & older ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environment and Health Group (EHG), Inc., in collaboration with a number of Boston MA and Columbia SC based organizations, seeks to enhance, test, and commercialize an individually-tailored, culturally-sensitive, positive-psychology and behavioral-economics based, mobile health intervention to promote ART adherence, increase ART self-efficacy and reduce feelings of stress burden among HIV positive African Americans age 45 and older. African Americans represent a growing portion (41%) of people living with HIV (CDC, 2012; 2014); by 2015, those age 50+ will account for half of all cases of HIV/AIDS in the U.S. (NIDA, 2012). Poor ART adherence contributes to disparities in HIV/AIDS outcomes among older African Americans. The proposed project is based on EHG's previous research with HIV+, age 50 years and older, African American adults. That research revealed personalized pill reminder text messages with positive-psychology based motivational and educational messages are effective at addressing two major barriers to ART adherence in this group: 1) memory deficits resulting from the combined effects of HIV, cognitive aging, and increased allostatic load, and 2) low motivation due to lack of ART self efficacy and negative affect. Findings showed significant improvement in ART adherence scores and marginally significant improvement in ART self- efficacy scores. While affect scores did not change, qualitative findings showed the intervention helped reduce feelings of stress burden. Supporting ART adherence is key to reducing health disparities among HIV+ African Americans. Doing so for those, age 45 and older-who are most vulnerable to cumulative, age-accelerating effects of HIV infection and allostatic load-is urgent, which is why we are lowering the age cut-off from 50 to 45 in Phase II. To date, no ART adherence support intervention has been developed for this highly-vulnerable group. The Phase II project will enhance the existing mobile intervention by offering: 1) a two-way communication capability through which participants can: i) indicate ""pill taken"" in response to pill reminders, and ii) receive a positive visual icon as behavioral-economics based reinforcement for ""pill taken"" responses; 2) live, real-time pharmacist counseling and medication support; and, 3) the addition of opt-in smoking cessation educational and motivational texts. Overall aims are to: 1) expand mhealth intervention to incorporate new Phase II features; 2) evaluate effectiveness in an RCT of HIV+ African Americans age 45 and older; and 3) prepare marketing and commercialization plans. Our long-term goal is to increase ART adherence, thus decreasing health disparities, among HIV+, African-Americans, age 45+.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: According to the CDC (2013), there are approximately 215,000 African Americans in the age group of 45 and older who are living with an HIV diagnosis. Unfortunately, many African-Americans will die earlier from HIV/AIDS than their white, non-Hispanic counterparts, due in large part, to lack of adherence to Antiretroviral therapy (ART). The proposed mhealth intervention seeks to increase ART adherence among HIV+ African- Americans, who are over the age of 45, thus improving health outcomes and reducing disparities in this group.            ",mHealth for ART adherence by HIV+ African Americans age 45 & older,9065147,R44MD007161,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Boston ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communication ', ' Counseling ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Holidays ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Marketing ', ' Memory ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Delivering High-Quality HIV Care in the South: System-Level Policy Alternatives PROJECT SUMMARY While clinical care for HIV has made tremendous advances, the majority of persons living with HIV in the US do not receive the evidence-based care that will allow them to fully extend life and improve health. Lack of effective HIV care is particularly problematic in the Southern region, the epicenter of the US HIV epidemic and where poverty, uninsurance, rurality, and a constrained health workforce further threaten effective care. Research suggests that system-level factors, or the structural and policy-related aspects of health care delivery, have the potential to improve quality of care and health outcomes. But little is known about their role in the context of HIV care delivery, quality of care, and health outcomes. The proposed research will study how two modifiable system-level factors—geographic accessibility to care and physician payment policies—affect quality of HIV care and population outcomes, including new HIV infections, along the HIV care continuum in the US South. Because racial and ethnic minorities face increased barriers to HIV care, we pay special attention to how these system-level factors may contribute to disparities in quality of HIV care and population outcomes along the HIV care continuum. The research involves developing a novel database that combines multiple data sources, including Medicaid administrative claims files, HIV surveillance data, and county and state characteristics from national datasets. Our approach will rely on state-of-the-art spatial network analysis and data visualization (mapping), statistical tests using econometric methods, and systems science forecasting techniques that have been used to study quality of care and population health outcomes. The work moves beyond examination of core quality of HIV care measures to include HIV-related preventive care measures that collectively are critical to reducing HIV morbidity and mortality. In investigating these factors, the study will answer a number of important questions. How do geographic accessibility, measured in travel time to receive care, and physician payment for services affect quality of HIV care in the South? Are these effects different among racial and ethnic minorities? Do improvements in geographic accessibility or increased physician payments reduce new HIV infections and racial and ethnic disparities along the HIV care continuum? The proposed study will address these questions and others. By quantifying the role of system-level factors in quality of HIV care and population health along the HIV care continuum, as well as understanding disparities in these effects, the research will provide valuable information to state and federal policy makers who seek to address systemic challenges to effective HIV care, efficiently allocate scarce resources, and improve public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Improving geographic access to care (measured in travel time to receive care) and assuring adequate physician payments for services are potential pathways to improve care for HIV patients in the Southern states, the center of the US HIV epidemic. This project investigates the effects of these pathways on quality of HIV care and on population health, including new HIV infections, and the differences in these effects across populations--particularly racial and ethnic minorities who face increased barriers to HIV care. This study will guide future federal and state policy regarding the geographic placement of HIV services and payments for physicians, which will lead to improved health for HIV patients in the US South.",Delivering High-Quality HIV Care in the South: System-Level Policy Alternatives,9203796,R01MD011277,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Appointment ', ' Attention ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Fasting ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Maps ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' flu immunisation ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' federal policy ', ' population health ', ' surveillance data ', ' data visualization ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' ']",NIMHD,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,382719,0.23241742546215244
"Scale-up of an Internet-Delivered Randomized Controlled Trial for HIV+ Men Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved survival for those living with HIV. However, low-level ART adherence can impede viral suppression, which presents a major public health challenge due to the probability of further HIV transmission. In the U.S., gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) accounted for 70% of new HIV infections in 2014. What is more concerning is that 60% of HIV-positive GBMSM are not adherent to ART. Further, disparities exist among HIV-positive minority racial/ethnicity GBMSM, who are less likely to be engaged in HIV care, are less adherent to their ART, and more likely to have detectable HIV viremia than White GBMSM. It has been established that ART adherence reduces HIV RNA levels in blood and semen, and studies show that viral suppression is associated with decreased transmission of HIV to sexual partners. This study is a supplement to the parent study (R01 MH100973), an online, video-based 2-arm intervention for 1,500 high-risk, virally unsuppressed or sub-optimally ART adherent U.S. HIV-positive GBMSM who are being followed for 12 months. In this supplement, we propose to use dried blood spot (DBS) kits to: verify participant self-reported viral load and quantify levels of HIV viremia among participants after 12-month follow-up. Recent online studies of GBMSM have shown relatively high uptake of home collection of biomarker data at an approximately 70% return rate. Improved DBS collection materials (HemaSpot™) have been developed, streamlining blood collection. To our knowledge, the proposed study would be the first to implement at-home DBS collection in a high-risk, HIV-positive GBMSM online study population using a state-of-the-art DBS collection device. The proposed supplement will increase the value of the parent project by: 1) determining the proportion of men enrolled in an online behavioral intervention who have an undetectable HIV viral load, post 12-month follow-up, 2) providing a comparison between laboratory-measured viral load and self-reported viral load, and 3) engaging priority populations (e.g., young minority HIV-positive GBMSM who experience health disparities) in healthcare/self-care-related activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preventing transmission in virally unsuppressed HIV+ MSM who have unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) with serodiscordant partners can have a great public health impact with the potential to be cost-effective and scalable, both goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) and the 2013 Trans-NIH Plan for reducing new HIV infections.

"Disparities in the HIV Care Continuum among Hispanics in the United States ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic has disproportionately affected the Hispanic population in the United States (US). Hispanics face the second-highest prevalence and incidence rates of HIV. Hispanics are also more likely to receive HIV care at later stages of HIV disease progression relative to any other racial or ethnic group. A complex set of unique individual- and structural-level factors confront this population and contribute to the burden of health disparities in HIV care and treatment experienced by Hispanics. In 2015, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States: Updated to 2020 (NHAS) set forth goals to reduce HIV-related disparities in high-risk populations, such as Hispanics, and to increase the proportion of individuals successfully engaged at all levels of the spectrum of HIV care and treatment. This spectrum, termed the HIV care continuum (HIVCC), has become a high-priority area for intervention. Increasing the proportions of HIV-infected individuals who progress through and ultimately reach the last stage of the HIVCC (viral suppression) has been shown to prevent over 90% of new HIV infections. To address the Hispanic population's unique HIV-related needs, it is critical to monitor trends in HIV care indicators for improvement over time and to identify the factors underlying HIV care in this population for the development of tailored public health interventions. We aim to: 1) estimate trends in the proportion of adult Hispanics that were in the last three steps of the HIVCC (retention in HIV care, prescription of antiretrovirl therapy [ART], and viral suppression) from 2004 to 2014; 2) identify demographic factors and behavioral targets for interventions to improve retention in HIV care, ART use, and viral suppression among Hispanic adults in HIV care in the US; and 3) explore the nature of progression through the last three steps of the HIVCC among adult Hispanics and identify the structural-level barriers and facilitators influencing this progression using qualitative research methods. For Aims 1 and 2, we will use data from the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD). The NA-ACCORD offers the largest-available source of longitudinal data on HIV- infected Hispanics (>15,000) in the US and has been endorsed by the Institute of Medicine as an appropriate data source for monitoring progress in NHAS goals. We will conduct qualitative in-depth interviews (N=25) with HIV-infected Hispanics in Baltimore City in Aim 3 to obtain a rich, complementary understanding of structural- level factors influencing HIVCC proportions among Hispanics. The results of this research will inform strategies designed to achieve NHAS goals to reduce health disparities and improve HIV care among Hispanics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics in the United States face unique, complex challenges to HIV prevention, medical care, and treatment, demonstrating the imperative need for public health interventions that are specifically tailored to this important population. The results of the proposed research will provide a strong basis with which to inform interventions designed to reduce persistent HIV-related health disparities by increasing the proportion of Hispanics that are retained in HIV clinical care, are prescribed antiretroviral therapy, and ultimately achieve HIV viral suppression. Increased rates of viral suppression among Hispanics will, in turn, contribute to reduced HIV transmission and improved HIV-related health outcomes in this population.        ",Disparities in the HIV Care Continuum among Hispanics in the United States,9136350,F31AI124794,"['Accounting ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Baltimore ', ' Cities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Persons ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Nature ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Viral ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' attributable fraction ', ' Population Attributable Risks ', ' Population Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' public health intervention ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,48576,0.24263908330845893
"Identifying and Engaging Urban HIV infected and uninfected YBMSM in care Project Summary The U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy 2020 calls for increasing access to care and improving outcomes of people living with HIV and targeting biomedical prevention efforts (including access to pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) where HIV is most heavily concentrated. Baltimore, MD; Washington, DC; and Philadelphia, PA (BWP) are disproportionately burdened by high rates of new cases of HIV infection, with disproportionate rates in young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) aged 15 to 24. High incidence underscores the need for increased identification, linkage and initiation in HIV and preventive care for YBMSM. Grants focused on high rates directly address NIH research priorities to reduce health disparities in the incidence of HI, in ART outcomes or in high HIV prevalent or high-risk areas. This innovative proposal seeks to test, treat and retain YBMSM living in BWP along the prevention and treatment continuums using the following aims: Aim 1. Identify and recruit young (ages 15-24) black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) in 3 urban cities who are (1) HIV-infected, not virally suppressed; and (2) high-risk HIV uninfected YBMSM, including gender variant and questioning men, using respondent driven sampling with targeted seed identification; Aim 2. Compare the efficacy of two study arms (mobile-enhanced engagement intervention (MEI) vs. standard of care (SOC)) to achieve sustained retention (measured by ≥ 4 follow up visits per 18 months) and engagement in HIV care (measured by durable viral suppression (HIV VL < 200 copies/ml) and substance treatment among 300 HIV infected YBMSM who are not virally suppressed and recruited from RDS; and Aim 3. Modify and implement mobile-enhanced intervention for 300 high-risk HIV uninfected YBMSM, recruited from RDS to promote linkage, retention and engagement of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and substance treatment uptake over 12 months, comparing younger (15-19) and older (20-24) participants. The mobile-enhanced engagement intervention is driven by the expressed and self-determined needs of each HIV infected and uninfected participant and includes care navigation, engagement, treatment and adherence, with a supplemental SBIRT+ intervention, to support YBMSM who face barriers accessing substance use treatment. By building upon existing case management services and flexibility to be adapted across ages and maturity and for prevention services, this intervention has the ability to transform networks, HIV and prevention care in YBMSM in cities with very high primary and secondary HIV transmission. Project Narrative This 3-city proposal seeks to address disparities of HIV in YBMSM in a multilevel intervention to identify, link retain and engage, high-risk uninfected and HIV infected urban YBMSM in prevention and treatment cascade. The mobile-enhanced engagement intervention is driven by the expressed and self-determined needs of each HIV infected and uninfected participant and includes care navigation, engagement, treatment and adherence, with a supplemental SBIRT+ intervention, to support YBMSM who face barriers accessing substance use treatment.

"Using MOST to optimize an HIV care continuum intervention for vulnerable populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than half of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. are insufficiently engaged in HIV primary care and not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), mainly African Americans and Latinos. In the proposed project, two experienced and productive behavioral scientists will employ a potent and innovative research methodology, the Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST), to develop a highly efficacious, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum. Whereas randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are valuable for evaluating the efficacy of multi-component interventions as a package, they are not designed to evaluate which specific components contribute to efficacy. MOST, a pioneering, engineering-inspired framework, addresses this problem through highly efficient randomized experimentation to assess the performance of individual intervention components and their interactions. We propose to use MOST to engineer an intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum for African American and Latino PLHA not well engaged in care and not taking ART. Further, the intervention will be optimized for cost-effectiveness. This efficiency and cost-effectiveness are critical in a time of constrained resources, and will also increase the intervention's future scalability. NIH has signaled its interest in MOST, and this is the first study to apply it in the ield of adult HIV treatment. A similar set of multi-level factors impede both HIV care and ART initiation for African American and Latino PLHA, primary among them individual (e.g., substance use, distrust, fear), social (e.g., stigma), and structural-level barriers (e.g., difficulties accesing ancillary services). Guided by a multi-level social cognitive theory, the study will evaluate 5 distinct intervention components (i.e., Motivational Interviewing sessions, pre-adherence preparation, support groups, peer mentorship, and patient navigation), each designed to address a specific barrier to HIV care and ART initiation. These components are well-grounded in the empirical literature and were found acceptable, feasible, and promising with respect to efficacy in a preliminary study. Study aims are: 1) using a highly efficient experimental design, identify which of 5 components contribute meaningfully to improvement in viral suppression, and secondary outcomes of ART adherence and engagement in HIV primary care; 2) identify mediators and moderators of component efficacy; and 3) using a mathematical modeling approach, build the most cost-effective and efficient intervention package from the efficacious components. A heterogeneous sample of African American and Latino PLHA (with respect to age, substance use, and sexual minority status) will be recruited with a proven hybrid sampling method using targeted sampling in community settings and peer recruitment (N=512). This highly innovative and significant study, which addresses a high- priority research area (NIH NOT-OD-15-137), will produce an HIV care continuum intervention for the nation's most vulnerable PLHA, optimized for cost-effectiveness, and with exceptional levels of efficacy, efficiency, and scalability.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study targets the large population of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. who are both insufficiently engaged in HIV primary care and not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), who are mainly African American/Black and Latino. NIH has emphasized the urgent need for new research approaches to advance intervention science, and the proposed project employs a new, potent, and innovative research methodology, the Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST), a framework for developing highly efficacious, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective interventions. The proposed study has the highest public health significance: it addresses a vulnerable population of PLHA, including the critically important subpopulations of men who have sex with men (MSM) and substance users; will develop an efficient and cost effective intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum for these vulnerable groups; and addresses two areas highlighted in the August 2015 notice on research priorities from the NIH Office of AIDS Research (NOT-OD-15-137) , namely, engaging PLHA in prevention/treatment services, and reducing HIV/AIDS-related racial/ethnic disparities.        ",Using MOST to optimize an HIV care continuum intervention for vulnerable populations,9137118,R01DA040480,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Hair ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Self Determination ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Preparation ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' sexual minority ', ' intrinsic motivation ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,1161504,0.19543391353938494
"Connecting People, Places, and Barriers:  The Effect of These Connections on Adhe DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a trained health geographer with expertise in the areas of social-ecological models, neighborhood effects, and Geographic Information System, I am further interested in expanding my research foci in the interface of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS, both from methodological and intervention perspectives. To that end, in the upcoming five years of training, I will devote my time to focused research on multidimensional correlates to adherence, retention, and HIV treatment outcomes among infected drug users using system science techniques. The ultimate goal is to design interventions to improve HIV treatment outcomes among this vulnerable population. To achieve this goal, I will work with an internationally recognized group of mentors to obtain training in the epidemiology of substance use disorders, HIV transmission and treatment, social network analysis, and design of interventions. My specific objectives to achieve this career goal are: 1. Enhance my background and understanding of existing literature on behavioral and clinical interventions to  seek, test, treat, and retain in care among drug users with HIV infection. 2. A. Advance expertise in theory, visualization, and application of social network analysis, including  egocentric network, whole network, and longitudinal networks.

Development of an independent career path in behavioral intervention-oriented research focused on the  intersection between substance abuse and HIV by successfully writing and receipt of a R01 grant.  Given the vital importance of mentoring in the process of training and career development, I have assembled a strong interdisciplinary panel of mentors and consultants who will provide guidance throughout my five years of advanced training. Dr. Frederick Altice will serve as my primary mentor (substance abuse, HIV, intervention), with Drs. Michael Copenhaver (HIV, intervention) and Carl Latkin (social network analysis, neighborhood effects, intervention) as co-mentors. I will further consult Drs. Ofer Harel for biostatistics, Lesie Snyder for health communication, and Michael Emch for geographical theories of health research. The training will provide opportunities to conduct two research projects for vulnerable drug users with HIV infection. Study 1: To inform the development of an intervention by examining multidimensional (individual- social-ecological) correlates of adherence to ART, retention in care, and HIV treatment outcomes among drug using HIV positive population. [Year 1, 2, 3 (Part)] This is a secondary analysis using data from a randomized controlled trial (Project STRIDE, Altice, R01 DA030768) and its 'Social Network and Neighborhood' Supplement. To this I add the following aims:  Specific Aim 1: Extend social network metrics (i.e., derived from network structure) to spatial-social metrics (based on both network structure and spatial proximity between subjects and their network members).  Specific Aim 2: Visualize and map the 'activity space' patterns of subjects in a Geographic Information Science interface, including visits to routine locations of positive and negative influence. This is significantly different tha the just the residential location of the subjects.  Specific Aim 3: Examine the combined effect of individual, social relationships, activity space, and neighborhood correlates of adherence to ART, retention, and HIV treatment outcomes modeled on a robust multidimensional social-ecological framework. Study 2: To develop and pilot a spatial-network driven intervention with short message services (SMS) that will optimize adherence to ART, retention in care, and HIV treatment outcomes for HIV positive drug users. [Year 3(Part), 4, 5]  Phase 1: Select social network members (or alters) who will have stronger effect on the subjects (or egos) adherence to ART, retention, and HIV treatment outcomes. Formative evaluations of ego's activity space and composition and features of their social networks from Study 1 will determine the selection protocol. Phase 2: Conduct a pilot to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacyof a novel spatial- network driven intervention with SMS. The intervention has three arms: 1) Ego in HIV care with two alters assigned highest Interaction Index value, living inside ego's activity space receiving SMS, 2) Egos in HIV care with two alters assigned highest Interaction Index values, living outside the activity space receiving SMS, and 3) Egos in HIV care with no intervention (observational arm). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: First, identify barriers to adherence, retention in care, and HIV treatment outcomes among drug users with HIV infection using a multidimensional (individual, social relationships, activity space, and neighborhoods) social- ecological framework. Second, using correlates from these dimensions (specifically geographic proximity and interaction with social network members) a spatial-network-driven intervention is developed to improve adherence and HIV treatment outcomes. These projects will address the critical retention component of HIV treatment cascade and reduce ""fall-offs"" among positive drug users.","Connecting People, Places, and Barriers:  The Effect of These Connections on Adhe",9118164,K01DA037794,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Improving engagement in HIV care for high-risk women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender women (assigned `male' at birth but who do not identify as male) are disproportionately impacted by HIV and have culturally unique barriers and facilitators to engagement in HIV care. Transgender women living with HIV (TWH) are less likely than others to take antiretroviral therapy (ART), and those who initiate ART have lower rates of ART adherence, lower self-efficacy for integrating ART into daily routines, and report fewer positive interactions with health care providers than non-transgender adults. As a result, TWH have an almost three-fold higher viral load than non-transgender adults in San Francisco; in Los Angeles, TWH are less likely to be virally suppressed than any other behavioral risk group. In our formative work, we have identified culturally-specific and modifiable barriers to HIV treatment engagement among TWH, including prioritization of transition-related health care (i.e. hormone therapy) at the expense of HIV treatment, avoidance of HIV care settings due to past negative health care experiences, misinformation about ART including potential drug interactions with hormones, intensified HIV stigma, low levels of social support, and poor coping skills. There are both individual and public health consequences to poor engagement in care among TWH stemming from high transmission risk factors, including substance abuse, high numbers of sex partners, engagement in sex work, and high rates of mental illness. These findings strongly suggest that TWH face unique challenges to engaging in and adhering to HIV treatment, and that the public health consequences for poor engagement in this population are of grave concern. Interventions to mitigate these barriers to engagement in care are critical in efforts to alter the pattern of HIV-related disparities that lead to disproportionately poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable and marginalized population. We propose a randomized controlled trial of a theory- driven, population-specific, piloted intervention to improve engagement in care for TWH. Grounded in the investigators' Models of Gender Affirmation and Health Care Empowerment, the proposed research is the first to systematically intervene on complex barriers to optimal engagement in HIV care for TWH. We have developed and piloted the Healthy Divas intervention to optimize engagement in HIV care for TWH at elevated risk for treatment failure and consequential morbidity, mortality, and transmission of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed trial is grounded in a novel transgender-specific framework and is the culmination of years of work in a community at heightened risk for HIV treatment failure and transmission of HIV to others. If effective, the proposed intervention approach has the potential to optimize health outcomes in a population highly burdened by HIV while preventing further transmission.",Improving engagement in HIV care for high-risk women,9139973,R01MH106373,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Appointment ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Critical Care ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' indexing ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' male ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Silicones ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Misinformation ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Shelter facility ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Failure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' uptake ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Life ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' health care model ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' virus load ', ' Viral load measurement ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Adherence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' trial comparing ', ' stem ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,935579,0.1988959647999412
"Addressing Barriers to Retention in HIV Care for Hispanic Immigrants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient engagement in HIV care encompasses a cascade of events from HIV diagnosis to retention in care. Each step is vital in achieving the goal of virologic suppression and improved health outcomes. Compromising this clinical imperative is the nearly 50% of HIV-infected individuals in the US who are not in continuous HIV care. The HIV epidemic poses a particularly severe problem in Hispanic populations. While Hispanics comprise 16% of the US population, they comprise 20% of new HIV infections. Immigrants make up 42% of new HIV diagnoses in Hispanics. Emerging interventions to improve retention in HIV care in the general HIV-infected population have not been adequately studied in Hispanic immigrants, a growing segment of the population where risk for poor outcomes is a precarious reality. Factors specific both to Hispanic cultures and to immigrant status are essential to highlight for effective intervention development. A better understanding of these factors could lead to improved, tailored approaches to retention in HIV care for Hispanic immigrants, improvement in health outcomes, and a reduction in ongoing HIV transmission. CANDIDATE: My specialized training in clinical infectious disease, public health, and Hispanic studies, coupled with extensive resources at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), uniquely position me to accomplish these aims. I have five peer-reviewed research articles directly related to HIV outcomes and the consequences of adherence to care in resource-limited settings, and extensive clinical experience caring for HIV-infected individuals as well as immigrants. RESEARCH: I will conduct formative qualitative research with Hispanic immigrants infected with HIV and their medical providers to understand factors (e.g. individual preferences, structural barriers) and agents (e.g. role of the family) that influence decision-making around retention in primary HIV care. I will give specific attention to generating novel intervention ideas to improve retention in HIV care through these in-depth interviews with patients and the multi-disciplinary providers within an HIV provider team including physicians, nurses, social workers, case managers, and community health workers (Aim 1). I will expand the Andersen Model of Health Services Use to include conceptual models of health disparities in order to evaluate societal, clinic/system- level, and individual determinants of HIV care utilization. Guided by this conceptual model, formative research, and community stakeholder feedback, we will identify the most significant and modifiable factors that determine retention in HIV care for the study population in order to inform the development of an intervention. We will develop and pilot test a culturally-tailored intervention (Aim 2). The intervention will target Hispanic immigrants who are not retained in HIV care, and for whom there are limited culturally relevant interventions. We will intervene at a particularly vulnerable period in the HIV care cascade, retention in care, where care interruption poses substantial consequences for both the individual, due to risk of clinical decline and risk-taking behaviors, and for public health, due threat of resulting HIV transmission. Standardization of the intervention will occur through iterative refinements based on participant and community advisory board feedback. Through a focused randomized pilot trial (Aim 3), we will further refine study procedures and perform preliminary power analyses in preparation for a larger, more definitive test of the intervention directed through submission of an R01 proposal at the end of the award. TRAINING/MENTORING: My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing culturally-tailored community-based interventions to improve outcomes in HIV and other chronic diseases for vulnerable populations. I will need rigorous training in methodologies that will enable me to fully capture factors, such as culture and context, and processes, such as acculturation, that influence use of HIV care for Hispanic immigrants. Training in community-engaged methods will facilitate effective development and deployment of novel interventions in the community setting. To complement my prior training in clinical care and HIV outcomes research, I have outlined a plan for intensive training in community-based participatory research, qualitative research, behavioral theory, and intervention development. This training will occur through graduate-level coursework as well as through intensive supervision with my mentors, who are internationally- recognized leaders in areas of research directly related to the proposal. My mentorship team also has a strong foothold in community-based partnerships for research and HIV care delivery in Massachusetts and nationally. Furthermore, this project advances the institutional strategic priorities of the CDC, NIMH and the Office of AIDS Research, notably, to reduce HIV health disparities and to improve medical care for people living with HIV. The successful completion of this research will position me as an expert in retention in care for HIV-infected Hispanic immigrants, and more generally will enable me to address challenges in vulnerable populations burdened with chronic illnesses that require innovative models for disease management. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of the 1.2 million HIV-infected individuals in the US, nearly 50% are not engaged in regular HIV care and 80% do not show viral load suppression, a marker of HIV treatment success. Among Hispanic patients with HIV, immigrants represent 40% of new HIV cases, an important public health disparity that reflects a confluence of ill-defined risks and barriers to health care. This Career Development Award will address the knowledge gap in barriers to retention in HIV care for Hispanic immigrants, and will leverage this information to develop and pilot test culturally-relevant approaches to improve retention in care, a critical yet underdeveloped area of public health research.",Addressing Barriers to Retention in HIV Care for Hispanic

"Unified Intervention to Impact HIV Care Continuum This pragmatic adaptive clinical trial will test the effects of a Stigma-Motivational-Decision intervention designed to increase HIV treatment engagement, retention, and medication adherence for substance using adolescents and young adults (AYA) living with HIV who are not in clinical care. The intervention uses a uniquely unified counseling approach at multiple points along the HIV continuum of care. In a first step, we will use multiple modes of outreach including social media, passive media, clinic records, and chain referrals to seek and identify HIV positive AYA (age 16 to 25) who are out of HIV care. In Step 2, HIV positive AYA who are out of HIV care and substance using will be enrolled in a phone-delivered counseling intervention to address substance use, HIV stigmas, medical care-related concerns, structural barriers, and other challenges to engaging youth in HIV care. Counseling will be provided weekly until the time participants are engaged in care, with a maximum of 12 sessions (up 3-months). We will therefore determine the number of theory-based phone intervention sessions needed (minimally effective dose) for care engagement and the associated costs. Once engaged in care, Step 3 will conduct a randomized trial to test the comparative effects and cost effectiveness of interactive text messaging with opportunities for ongoing supportive problem solving versus text message reminders to sustain long-term retention in care and medication adherence. HIV positive AYA are likely to drop out of care because of known challenges such as substance use, social barriers such as stigma, and concerns regarding treatment. Our 3-step study will use a single theory-based approach to determine the number of phone-delivered Stigma-Motivational-Decision counseling intervention sessions necessary to achieve engagement or re-engagement in HIV care, and will test the effects of a low-cost approach to sustaining long-term retention in care and medication adherence. Participants will be out of care at baseline and counseled with up to 12 weekly phone-delivered intervention sessions until they confirm engagement in HIV care. The study will determine the minimally effective counseling dose needed to engage substance using HIV positive AYA in care. Once participants attend HIV medical appointments, they will be randomized to either: (a) 15-months of ongoing weekly mobile phone text message check-ins with the opportunity for brief problem-focused phone support or (b) weekly text message reminders. The study will test the effects of the counseling and text messaging interventions on maintaining HIV care retention, medication adherence, and HIV viral suppression over 18-months. The primary endpoint in this trial is HIV RNA suppression. We will perform economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of the engagement-retention-adherence intervention. The proposed pragmatic adaptive trial will therefore determine the minimally effective dose of counseling and the effects of a low-burden retention/adherence intervention to maintain retention in care and avoid relapse to non-adherence for AYA living with HIV. Retention in HIV care and persistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy effectively manages HIV infection, suppresses HIV replication, preserves the immune system, and reduces HIV infectiousness. Unfortunately, young people living with HIV who use alcohol and other drugs are often out of care or at risk of dropping out of HIV care. The proposed research will conduct a pragmatic adaptive clinical trial to determine the number of theory-based behavioral counseling sessions needed to engage young individuals in HIV care, and compare two text messaging interventions designed to support long-term retention in HIV care, medication adherence, and HIV viral suppression.",Unified Intervention to Impact HIV Care Continuum,9233354,R01DA043068,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Age ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Records ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Running ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus Replication ', ' virus multiplication ', ' viral replication ', ' viral multiplication ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' economic evaluation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Staging ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' medical appointment ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' comparative ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment adherence ', ' substance using adolescents ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' number theory ', ' diophantine approximation ', ' HIV-infected adolescents ', ' HIV infections in adolescents ', ' HIV infection in adolescence ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' social media ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2016,729750,0.19382299006848236
"The AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) represent a marginalized population with substantial disparities in health care access and outcomes. Since 1988, the AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) study has followed disadvantaged, predominantly African American HIV-infected and at-risk IDUs in a community-based observational cohort, providing important evidence on the natural and treated course of HIV among IDUs. We have characterized the rates and risk factors for incident HIV infection and for progression to AIDS or death, described patterns of risk behavior, and determined barriers to optimal HIV care. Since availability of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), optimal HIV care is now achieved by early HIV testing; prompt linkage to HIV care, timely initiation of ART, high adherence, retention in care, and prolonged virological suppression. Drug use may have detrimental effects at each stage of this HIV Care Continuum. Proposed is a multidisciplinary research agenda with the primary objective to continue the epidemiological, pathogenesis, behavioral, and clinical characterization of the evolving HIV epidemic among IDUs as they age and drug use patterns change. While the cohort has and continues to be a platform for an array of studies critical to addressing critical on HIV and drug use, this proposal emphasizes examination of IDUs' navigation of the HIV Care Continuum. We aim to characterize the dynamic nature of the Care Continuum and to identify the key determinants of successful navigation and the consequences of stagnation. Successful navigation entails consistent engagement in care with prompt ART initiation and prolonged viral suppression. In contrast, we introduce the concept of stagnation, incorporating navigation patterns involving a failure to progress and delayed or relapsing transitions through the Continuum. We will describe longitudinal navigation patterns, characterize the time required to transition through stages, and identify sociodemographic, behavioral, provider and neighborhood-level determinants of the primary navigation patterns. We hypothesize that less successful navigation (stagnation) in the Care Continuum will have serious clinical consequences, increasing the risk for both AIDS or non-AIDS events as well as death. The key impact of this aim is to illuminate mechanisms, identify modifiable risk factors, and provide novel insight to inform efficient and targeted intervention development to mitigate the consequences of less effective HIV care among IDUs. To achieve these aims, we continue biannual visits with interview, exam, and biospecimen collection supplemented by medical record review and registry linkage. ALIVE represents the minority, socially-marginalized population at highest risk for HIV progression and limited access to care in Baltimore and nationally. The ALIVE study remains well- positioned to address these emerging issues confronting aging HIV-infected IDUs, namely characterizing long- term outcomes and enhancing HIV care through improving navigation of the HIV Care Continuum. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal supports continuation of the AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) study which has followed disadvantaged, predominantly African American HIV-infected and at-risk injection drug users (IDUs) in a community-based cohort since 1988. ALIVE provides a platform for longitudinally measuring risk behavior, treatment outcomes, disease incidence and prevalence, and cause-specific mortality among aging HIV-infected IDUs while also supporting independently-funded investigations of HIV and drug use.

"Evaluating ART for All HIV Seropositives: Can it work with the hardest cases? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On World AIDS Day, December 1, 2011, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) announced a new policy that all HIV seropositives should be offered antiretroviral treatment (ART) regardless of CD4 cell count. The new policy was based primarily on ""treatment as prevention"" as a method for not only improving the health of people living with HIV who initiate ART early, but also as a means of reducing transmission of the virus. The NYCDOHMH set an ambitious goal for this new policy: by one year post HIV diagnosis, 80% of new HIV diagnoses will have reached viral suppression. There are over 3,400 new HIV infections occurring annually in NYC; recent data indicate 38% reached durable viral suppression in 2006-07 (i.e., all viral loads 400 copies/mL). The policy goal is ambitious, but if it were to be achieved, it would almost certainly lead to an ""AIDS-free generation"" - the central theme of the 2012 International AIDS Conference - in the city with the largest local HIV epidemic in the US. There are serious difficulties in achieving this policy goal, notably the persistent racial/ethnic disparities in HIV infection in the city, especially among African-Americans, and drug-related sexual transmission. The overarching purpose of this research is to provide multisystem data to evaluate the implementation of the policy and help determine the most efficient use of available resources for achieving the policy goal. The design and methods are informed by the ecological systems model, while the RE-AIM model guides the overall assessment of the implementation of the new policy. The study aims are: 1) to assess durable viral suppression (i.e., two consecutive viral load tests 400 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL of plasma) within 12 months of diagnosis among a) STD clinic cohort (N = 300) with problem substance use, and b) all new HIV diagnoses in NYC occurring during the project funding period (N=approximately 3,400/year); 2) to assess key indicators along the HIV treatment cascade among the STD clinic cohort as the percentage who (a) link to HIV care; (b) receive a recommendation to initiate ART; (c) initiate ART treatment; and (d) adhere to ART treatment; 3) to assess multisystem predictors of durable viral load suppression and other HIV treatment cascade indicators among the STD clinic cohort and cohort of all new HIV diagnoses in NYC, to include individual (e.g., race/ethnicity, substance use) and geospatial factors (e.g., socioeconomic conditions, social disorder, social cohesion, and spatial access to HIV-related healthcare); 4) to describe and contextualize quantitative outcomes in Aims 1-3 using STD cohort qualitative data; and 5) to describe the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of HIV treatment policies among HIV primary care providers. The endpoint of durable viral suppression increases public health relevance as the primary indicator of HIV transmission risk. Data will be used to inform further implementation of the new policy, and in particular, to guide allocation of resources to reach the policy goal. Recommendations will be produced by a Collaborative Board comprised of community stakeholders and clinical researchers.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) has adopted a policy of offering anti- retroviral treatment (ART) to all newly diagnosed HIV seropositive persons, regardless of CD4 count, with a goal of reaching viral suppression in 80% of HIV seropositive persons within 12 months of diagnosis. If this ambitious policy goal can be achieved, it would be a major step towards an ""AIDS-free generation"" in the US city with the largest AIDS epidemic. The proposed research will evaluate the implementation of this policy, conducted in partnership with the DOHMH, and with recommendations for improvements informed through continuous feedback from a community collaborative board.",Evaluating ART for All HIV Seropositives: Can it work with the hardest cases?,9208297,R01DA035707,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Adoption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Life ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' cohesion ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Data ', ' International AIDS ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment adherence ', ' surveillance data ', ' seropositive ', ' viral transmission ', ' virus transmission ', ' ']",NIDA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,656358,0.0783636202126265
"Social Capital and Engagement in Care Among Young Black Men who have Sex with Men Living with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Nationally, over one-quarter of new HIV infections occur in adolescents and young adults, and the brunt of this youth epidemic is being borne by young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). HIV-positive YBMSM are additionally at high risk for suboptimal engagement in care, which has implications for individual morbidity and mortality as well as further transmission within the community. At the same time, prior work has demonstrated significant resilience and supportive social relationships among HIV-positive YBMSM. The unique strengths and vulnerabilities of YBMSM must be better understood in order to develop effective interventions that improve individual and public health outcomes. This proposal outlines an approach that seeks to integrate community-based participatory research with clinical research methods in order to understand the relationships between social network characteristics and engagement in HIV care among YBMSM. Specifically, we will focus on characterizing and augmenting YBMSM’s social capital, which we define as the sum of actual and potential resources contained in an individual’s social network. We will first conduct formative research with HIV-positive YBMSM as well as key informants from the community, to better understand the sources and characteristics of social capital among YBMSM. Next, with the guidance of a youth community advisory board, we will develop an intervention to augment social capital among HIV-positive YBMSM by engaging them in group projects aimed at community- oriented action. Finally, we will pilot test our intervention in a randomized controlled trial and assess its feasibility and acceptability as well as its impact on social capital and HIV care engagement outcomes. We are proposing a unique, strengths-based approach to augmenting HIV care engagement among YBMSM, and we believe that our utilization of community-based participatory methods will lead to the development of an intervention which is acceptable and sustainable in this population. Such novel strategies for improving engagement in care among YBMSM are critically needed to promote individual health and well-being, prevent secondary transmission, and decrease health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Innovative strategies are needed to promote engagement in HIV care among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). Social capital, which refers to the sum of an individual’s resource-containing network connections, has been proposed as a positive influence on engagement in care among people living with HIV. We therefore propose to develop and test a novel group-based intervention to enhance social capital and HIV care engagement among YBMSM utilizing a participatory, youth-centered approach to encourage community- oriented action.",Social Capital and Engagement in Care Among Young Black Men who have Sex with Men Living with HIV,9165689,U01PS005112,[''],NCHHSTP,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,263801,0.1198741796485349
"Improving Retention in Care Among Postpartum HIV-infected Women in Mississippi DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a 5-year training and research program that will allow Dr. Aadia Rana to achieve her goal of becoming an independent patient-oriented investigator with expertise in HIV health services and health disparities, integrating research and public health practice. The proposed program will build on the candidate's prior experience in HIV clinical research by enhancing her skills in mixed methods, health services, and clinical trials research involving behavioral interventions. The training plan will take advantage of an exceptional mentoring team and institutional environment that involves close collaboration between Alpert Medical School of Brown University, the University of Mississippi Medical Center, and the Mississippi Department of Health. Postpartum minority HIV-infected women in the southern United States face substantial challenges in access and retention in HIV care. This novel research proposal utilizes a population-based approach in evaluating retention in care among postpartum minority women in the rural South, and integrates a mixed-methods approach to examine the socioeconomic, demographic, and structural determinants of retention in care in this vulnerable population. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To comprehensively describe linkage and retention to HIV care following delivery, and the socioeconomic, demographic and structural determinants of linking and retaining in HIV care among postpartum women in Mississippi; 2)To prospectively evaluate the cascade of diagnosis, linkage, and retention in HIV medical care and the socioeconomic, psychosocial, and structural determinants of linking and retaining in HIV care among postpartum HIV-infected women in Mississippi; 3) To characterize the psychosocial facilitators and barriers to successful linkage and retention to care following delivery using qualitative methods. We will then incorporate the results of all of these studies in a future trial piloting an intervention integrating clinic and public health systems aimed at improving retention in HIV care among perinatal HIV-infected in Mississippi. This research will lay the groundwork for a larger research program on HIV care that will include rigorous evaluation of interventions aimed at improving the delivery of HIV care in disadvantaged populations with consideration for cost-effectiveness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will lead to an increased understanding of retention in care among postpartum minority women in the rural South. Improving linkage and retention to care following delivery will have significan impact on the success of the treatment as prevention strategy to decrease incidence of HIV infection and impact medical outcomes for women who experience disparities in access to care in the South. The objectives of this mixed methods research project are in line with the trans- NIH goal of reducing new HIV infections, addressing health disparities in HIV care, and improving outcomes for patients with HIV.",Improving Retention in Care Among Postpartum HIV-infected Women in Mississippi,9063086,K23MH100955,"['lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mississippi ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Improving engagement in HIV care for high-risk women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender women (assigned `male' at birth but who do not identify as male) are disproportionately impacted by HIV and have culturally unique barriers and facilitators to engagement in HIV care. Transgender women living with HIV (TWH) are less likely than others to take antiretroviral therapy (ART), and those who initiate ART have lower rates of ART adherence, lower self-efficacy for integrating ART into daily routines, and report fewer positive interactions with health care providers than non-transgender adults. As a result, TWH have an almost three-fold higher viral load than non-transgender adults in San Francisco; in Los Angeles, TWH are less likely to be virally suppressed than any other behavioral risk group. In our formative work, we have identified culturally-specific and modifiable barriers to HIV treatment engagement among TWH, including prioritization of transition-related health care (i.e. hormone therapy) at the expense of HIV treatment, avoidance of HIV care settings due to past negative health care experiences, misinformation about ART including potential drug interactions with hormones, intensified HIV stigma, low levels of social support, and poor coping skills. There are both individual and public health consequences to poor engagement in care among TWH stemming from high transmission risk factors, including substance abuse, high numbers of sex partners, engagement in sex work, and high rates of mental illness. These findings strongly suggest that TWH face unique challenges to engaging in and adhering to HIV treatment, and that the public health consequences for poor engagement in this population are of grave concern. Interventions to mitigate these barriers to engagement in care are critical in efforts to alter the pattern of HIV-related disparities that lead to disproportionately poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable and marginalized population. We propose a randomized controlled trial of a theory- driven, population-specific, piloted intervention to improve engagement in care for TWH. Grounded in the investigators' Models of Gender Affirmation and Health Care Empowerment, the proposed research is the first to systematically intervene on complex barriers to optimal engagement in HIV care for TWH. We have developed and piloted the Healthy Divas intervention to optimize engagement in HIV care for TWH at elevated risk for treatment failure and consequential morbidity, mortality, and transmission of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed trial is grounded in a novel transgender-specific framework and is the culmination of years of work in a community at heightened risk for HIV treatment failure and transmission of HIV to others. If effective, the proposed intervention approach has the potential to optimize health outcomes in a population highly burdened by HIV while preventing further transmission.",Improving engagement in HIV care for high-risk women,9312318,R01MH106373,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Appointment ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Critical Care ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' indexing ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Los Angeles ', ' male ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Silicones ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' virology ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Misinformation ', ' Coping Skills ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Shelter facility ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' uptake ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' health care model ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Viral load measurement ', ' virus load ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' trial comparing ', ' stem ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' follow up assessment ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,788397,0.1988959647999412
"Influence of neighborhoods and networks on the HIV care continuum among HIV-infected MSM in NYC Men who have sex with men (MSM) are highly impacted by HIV in the U.S. Marked disparities by race/ethnicity exist in HIV infection rates and engagement and retention in care along the HIV care continuum. Higher HIV acquisition rates among Black MSM are not fully explained by individual-level risk behaviors, while lower engagement and retention in care are exacerbated by factors that extend beyond the individual. In order to develop comprehensive, multi-level interventions to improve completion of steps along the HIV care continuum for Black and White MSM, it is critical to understand the mechanisms in which neighborhoods and social and sexual networks influence retention in care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, and viral suppression, and ascertain how these pathways differ by race/ethnicity. Using a socioecological theoretical framework, we propose to identify neighborhood-and network-level characteristics associated with HIV care outcomes among Black, non-Hispanic and White, non-Hispanic HIVinfected MSM in New York City (NYC) in a longitudinal study. We will focus on 3 potential neighborhoods of influence: home, social, and health facility access neighborhoods. We will investigate the influence of 4 neighborhood-level characteristic domains: (1) community violence, physical disorder, and social disorganization; (2) neighborhood alcohol and other drug (AOD) use-associated factors; (3) neighborhood-level social norms; (4) community resources. In this proposal, we will explore the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To use spatial analysis to characterize clustering and spatial trends in HIV care outcomes (retention in care, ART adherence, and viral suppression) among Black and White HIV-infected MSM in NYC. Aim 2: To examine HIV care outcomes by race/ethnicity among Black and White HIV-infected MSM in NYC in relationship to longitudinal changes in: 2A. Exposure to neighborhoods of potential influence (home, social, health facility access). 2B. Neighborhood characteristics in four conceptual domains (community violence/physical disorder/social disorganization, neighborhood AOD use-associated factors, neighborhood-level social norms, community resources). 2C. Social and sexual networks. Aim 3: To use multilevel modeling to assess associations among changes over time in exposure to the 4 neighborhood characteristic domains and changes in social and sexual networks with HIV care outcomes by race/ethnicity, while assessing the potential mediating effects of individual- and network-level factors. The study will employ an innovative approach combining geospatial mapping of neighborhoods with methods from the field of spatial statistics and an existing, extensive geospatial database. The study will have direct implications for the design of neighborhood- and network-level interventions to improve the HIV care continuum for MSM, particularly for Black MSM. The study purpose is to examine the neighborhoods in which HIV-infected Black and White men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City live, socialize, and get HIV medical care and the structure and make-up of social and sexual networks (connections between friends, family members, and sex partners) over time, and to assess the relationship of these characteristics to being retained in HIV care, adhering to HIV drugs, and achieving undetectable HIV viral load.

"Identifying and Engaging Urban HIV infected and uninfected YBMSM in care Project Summary The U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy 2020 calls for increasing access to care and improving outcomes of people living with HIV and targeting biomedical prevention efforts (including access to pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) where HIV is most heavily concentrated. Baltimore, MD; Washington, DC; and Philadelphia, PA (BWP) are disproportionately burdened by high rates of new cases of HIV infection, with disproportionate rates in young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) aged 15 to 24. High incidence underscores the need for increased identification, linkage and initiation in HIV and preventive care for YBMSM. Grants focused on high rates directly address NIH research priorities to reduce health disparities in the incidence of HI, in ART outcomes or in high HIV prevalent or high-risk areas. This innovative proposal seeks to test, treat and retain YBMSM living in BWP along the prevention and treatment continuums using the following aims: Aim 1. Identify and recruit young (ages 15-24) black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) in 3 urban cities who are (1) HIV-infected, not virally suppressed; and (2) high-risk HIV uninfected YBMSM, including gender variant and questioning men, using respondent driven sampling with targeted seed identification; Aim 2. Compare the efficacy of two study arms (mobile-enhanced engagement intervention (MEI) vs. standard of care (SOC)) to achieve sustained retention (measured by ≥ 4 follow up visits per 18 months) and engagement in HIV care (measured by durable viral suppression (HIV VL < 200 copies/ml) and substance treatment among 300 HIV infected YBMSM who are not virally suppressed and recruited from RDS; and Aim 3. Modify and implement mobile-enhanced intervention for 300 high-risk HIV uninfected YBMSM, recruited from RDS to promote linkage, retention and engagement of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and substance treatment uptake over 12 months, comparing younger (15-19) and older (20-24) participants. The mobile-enhanced engagement intervention is driven by the expressed and self-determined needs of each HIV infected and uninfected participant and includes care navigation, engagement, treatment and adherence, with a supplemental SBIRT+ intervention, to support YBMSM who face barriers accessing substance use treatment. By building upon existing case management services and flexibility to be adapted across ages and maturity and for prevention services, this intervention has the ability to transform networks, HIV and prevention care in YBMSM in cities with very high primary and secondary HIV transmission. Project Narrative This 3-city proposal seeks to address disparities of HIV in YBMSM in a multilevel intervention to identify, link retain and engage, high-risk uninfected and HIV infected urban YBMSM in prevention and treatment cascade. The mobile-enhanced engagement intervention is driven by the expressed and self-determined needs of each HIV infected and uninfected participant and includes care navigation, engagement, treatment and adherence, with a supplemental SBIRT+ intervention, to support YBMSM who face barriers accessing substance use treatment.

"Delivering High-Quality HIV Care in the South: System-Level Policy Alternatives PROJECT SUMMARY While clinical care for HIV has made tremendous advances, the majority of persons living with HIV in the US do not receive the evidence-based care that will allow them to fully extend life and improve health. Lack of effective HIV care is particularly problematic in the Southern region, the epicenter of the US HIV epidemic and where poverty, uninsurance, rurality, and a constrained health workforce further threaten effective care. Research suggests that system-level factors, or the structural and policy-related aspects of health care delivery, have the potential to improve quality of care and health outcomes. But little is known about their role in the context of HIV care delivery, quality of care, and health outcomes. The proposed research will study how two modifiable system-level factors—geographic accessibility to care and physician payment policies—affect quality of HIV care and population outcomes, including new HIV infections, along the HIV care continuum in the US South. Because racial and ethnic minorities face increased barriers to HIV care, we pay special attention to how these system-level factors may contribute to disparities in quality of HIV care and population outcomes along the HIV care continuum. The research involves developing a novel database that combines multiple data sources, including Medicaid administrative claims files, HIV surveillance data, and county and state characteristics from national datasets. Our approach will rely on state-of-the-art spatial network analysis and data visualization (mapping), statistical tests using econometric methods, and systems science forecasting techniques that have been used to study quality of care and population health outcomes. The work moves beyond examination of core quality of HIV care measures to include HIV-related preventive care measures that collectively are critical to reducing HIV morbidity and mortality. In investigating these factors, the study will answer a number of important questions. How do geographic accessibility, measured in travel time to receive care, and physician payment for services affect quality of HIV care in the South? Are these effects different among racial and ethnic minorities? Do improvements in geographic accessibility or increased physician payments reduce new HIV infections and racial and ethnic disparities along the HIV care continuum? The proposed study will address these questions and others. By quantifying the role of system-level factors in quality of HIV care and population health along the HIV care continuum, as well as understanding disparities in these effects, the research will provide valuable information to state and federal policy makers who seek to address systemic challenges to effective HIV care, efficiently allocate scarce resources, and improve public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Improving geographic access to care (measured in travel time to receive care) and assuring adequate physician payments for services are potential pathways to improve care for HIV patients in the Southern states, the center of the US HIV epidemic. This project investigates the effects of these pathways on quality of HIV care and on population health, including new HIV infections, and the differences in these effects across populations--particularly racial and ethnic minorities who face increased barriers to HIV care. This study will guide future federal and state policy regarding the geographic placement of HIV services and payments for physicians, which will lead to improved health for HIV patients in the US South.",Delivering High-Quality HIV Care in the South: System-Level Policy Alternatives,9329479,R01MD011277,"['Affect ', ' Appointment ', ' Attention ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Fasting ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incentives ', ' Lipids ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' influenza virus vaccination ', ' flu immunisation ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' federal policy ', ' population health ', ' surveillance data ', ' data visualization ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' rurality ', ' ']",NIMHD,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,382194,0.23241742546215244
"Using MOST to optimize an HIV care continuum intervention for vulnerable populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than half of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. are insufficiently engaged in HIV primary care and not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), mainly African Americans and Latinos. In the proposed project, two experienced and productive behavioral scientists will employ a potent and innovative research methodology, the Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST), to develop a highly efficacious, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum. Whereas randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are valuable for evaluating the efficacy of multi-component interventions as a package, they are not designed to evaluate which specific components contribute to efficacy. MOST, a pioneering, engineering-inspired framework, addresses this problem through highly efficient randomized experimentation to assess the performance of individual intervention components and their interactions. We propose to use MOST to engineer an intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum for African American and Latino PLHA not well engaged in care and not taking ART. Further, the intervention will be optimized for cost-effectiveness. This efficiency and cost-effectiveness are critical in a time of constrained resources, and will also increase the intervention's future scalability. NIH has signaled its interest in MOST, and this is the first study to apply it in the ield of adult HIV treatment. A similar set of multi-level factors impede both HIV care and ART initiation for African American and Latino PLHA, primary among them individual (e.g., substance use, distrust, fear), social (e.g., stigma), and structural-level barriers (e.g., difficulties accesing ancillary services). Guided by a multi-level social cognitive theory, the study will evaluate 5 distinct intervention components (i.e., Motivational Interviewing sessions, pre-adherence preparation, support groups, peer mentorship, and patient navigation), each designed to address a specific barrier to HIV care and ART initiation. These components are well-grounded in the empirical literature and were found acceptable, feasible, and promising with respect to efficacy in a preliminary study. Study aims are: 1) using a highly efficient experimental design, identify which of 5 components contribute meaningfully to improvement in viral suppression, and secondary outcomes of ART adherence and engagement in HIV primary care; 2) identify mediators and moderators of component efficacy; and 3) using a mathematical modeling approach, build the most cost-effective and efficient intervention package from the efficacious components. A heterogeneous sample of African American and Latino PLHA (with respect to age, substance use, and sexual minority status) will be recruited with a proven hybrid sampling method using targeted sampling in community settings and peer recruitment (N=512). This highly innovative and significant study, which addresses a high- priority research area (NIH NOT-OD-15-137), will produce an HIV care continuum intervention for the nation's most vulnerable PLHA, optimized for cost-effectiveness, and with exceptional levels of efficacy, efficiency, and scalability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study targets the large population of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. who are both insufficiently engaged in HIV primary care and not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), who are mainly African American/Black and Latino. NIH has emphasized the urgent need for new research approaches to advance intervention science, and the proposed project employs a new, potent, and innovative research methodology, the Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST), a framework for developing highly efficacious, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective interventions. The proposed study has the highest public health significance: it addresses a vulnerable population of PLHA, including the critically important subpopulations of men who have sex with men (MSM) and substance users; will develop an efficient and cost effective intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum for these vulnerable groups; and addresses two areas highlighted in the August 2015 notice on research priorities from the NIH Office of AIDS Research (NOT-OD-15-137) , namely, engaging PLHA in prevention/treatment services, and reducing HIV/AIDS-related racial/ethnic disparities.",Using MOST to optimize an HIV care continuum intervention for vulnerable populations,9301510,R01DA040480,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Hair ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Self Determination ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Research Priority ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Preparation ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' sexual minority ', ' intrinsic motivation ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,1370384,0.19543391353938494
"mHealth for ART adherence by HIV+ African Americans age 45 & older ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environment and Health Group (EHG), Inc., in collaboration with a number of Boston MA and Columbia SC based organizations, seeks to enhance, test, and commercialize an individually-tailored, culturally-sensitive, positive-psychology and behavioral-economics based, mobile health intervention to promote ART adherence, increase ART self-efficacy and reduce feelings of stress burden among HIV positive African Americans age 45 and older. African Americans represent a growing portion (41%) of people living with HIV (CDC, 2012; 2014); by 2015, those age 50+ will account for half of all cases of HIV/AIDS in the U.S. (NIDA, 2012). Poor ART adherence contributes to disparities in HIV/AIDS outcomes among older African Americans. The proposed project is based on EHG's previous research with HIV+, age 50 years and older, African American adults. That research revealed personalized pill reminder text messages with positive-psychology based motivational and educational messages are effective at addressing two major barriers to ART adherence in this group: 1) memory deficits resulting from the combined effects of HIV, cognitive aging, and increased allostatic load, and 2) low motivation due to lack of ART self efficacy and negative affect. Findings showed significant improvement in ART adherence scores and marginally significant improvement in ART self- efficacy scores. While affect scores did not change, qualitative findings showed the intervention helped reduce feelings of stress burden. Supporting ART adherence is key to reducing health disparities among HIV+ African Americans. Doing so for those, age 45 and older-who are most vulnerable to cumulative, age-accelerating effects of HIV infection and allostatic load-is urgent, which is why we are lowering the age cut-off from 50 to 45 in Phase II. To date, no ART adherence support intervention has been developed for this highly-vulnerable group. The Phase II project will enhance the existing mobile intervention by offering: 1) a two-way communication capability through which participants can: i) indicate ""pill taken"" in response to pill reminders, and ii) receive a positive visual icon as behavioral-economics based reinforcement for ""pill taken"" responses; 2) live, real-time pharmacist counseling and medication support; and, 3) the addition of opt-in smoking cessation educational and motivational texts. Overall aims are to: 1) expand mhealth intervention to incorporate new Phase II features; 2) evaluate effectiveness in an RCT of HIV+ African Americans age 45 and older; and 3) prepare marketing and commercialization plans. Our long-term goal is to increase ART adherence, thus decreasing health disparities, among HIV+, African-Americans, age 45+. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: According to the CDC (2013), there are approximately 215,000 African Americans in the age group of 45 and older who are living with an HIV diagnosis. Unfortunately, many African-Americans will die earlier from HIV/AIDS than their white, non-Hispanic counterparts, due in large part, to lack of adherence to Antiretroviral therapy (ART). The proposed mhealth intervention seeks to increase ART adherence among HIV+ African- Americans, who are over the age of 45, thus improving health outcomes and reducing disparities in this group.",mHealth for ART adherence by HIV+ African Americans age 45 & older,9233205,R44MD007161,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Boston ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communication ', ' Counseling ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Holidays ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Marketing ', ' Memory ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Medication Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' pill ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Text ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' allostatic load ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' behavioral economics ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NIMHD,"ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH GROUP, INC.",R44,2017,369078,0.06618750625770427
"Understanding secondary prevention along the HIV care continuum among HIV+ Thai YMSM Project Summary  The HIV crisis in Bangkok men who have sex with men (MSM) is volatile with 31% HIV-infected and HIV incidence unbridled and ranging from 8.8% to 12.2% annually in young MSM (YMSM) aged 15-24 years. Consequently, HIV incidence in Bangkok YMSM is Asia’s highest, and in the absence of effective primary and secondary HIV prevention, will continue to increase. Scaling up ART has become the highest priority in responding to this crisis in Thailand. However, data are not available on the HIV care continuum, thus severely limiting critical information needed to design evidence-based secondary prevention interventions for linkage, retention and reengagement in HIV care. In accordance with the R21 funding mechanism, this exploratory study seeks to use the adapted socio-ecological framework to 1) conduct formative research with +YMSM, HIV clinicians and CBO leaders to investigatethe multi-level factors related to the HIV care continuum in Bangkok +YMSM; and 2) quantify the HIV care continuum in +YMSM, and examine the associated facilitators and barriers through a 9-month longitudinal, virtual cohort. A sub aim is to assess the feasibility of an online +YMSM cohort for future online intervention trials. Data from this proposed study by a new investigator will identify which secondary prevention strategies must be scaled in order to meet UNAIDS’ 90-90-90 goals. Findings from this study will not only fill critical gaps in the HIV care continuum literature, it will identify subgroups of +YMSM who are most left out from the health system and to whom targeted secondary prevention interventions should be developed. Project Narrative  There is an HIV crisis among young men who have sex with men (YMSM, 15 to 24 years) in Bangkok where 3 in 10 are positive. Scaling up ART among Bangkok +YMSM is critical to prevent onward transmission of HIV.This exploratory study will respond to this crisis by characterizing the HIV care continuum among +YMSM using an adapted multi-level socio-ecological framework.

"An HIV Retention in Care Intervention for Black MSM in Baltimore with a Job Readiness Component Project Summary  Retention in high-quality HIV care is critical for the health of people living with HIV (PLWH) as well as for reducing HIV transmission. One estimate of the HIV Continuum of Care for Black men how have sex with men (BMSM) in the US found that only 24% of BMSM are retained in care (RIC), 20% are on antiretroviral therapy, and 16% are virally suppressed. The structural factors that put men at increased risk for HIV, such as poverty, unemployment, and incarceration, also act as barriers to HIV care. The proposed project will develop and pilot test a retention in HIV care intervention for BMSM living in Baltimore that incorporates a job readiness component: Aim 1: Formative research for intervention development in practice settings One-to-one interviews with BMSM living with HIV will explore factors that facilitate engagement in care, unmet needs, and job readiness. Focus group discussions with key stakeholders will explore barriers and facilitators to implementing RIC interventions and the integration of job readiness into RIC programs. Aim 2: Develop and component test a RIC curriculum for BMSM with a job readiness component that is guided by Self-Determination Theory and an implementation science framework. Aim 3: Conduct a pilot RCT to assess feasibility and preliminary outcomes. A RCT with 50 BMSM living with HIV who are not virally suppressed will use mixed methods to assess acceptability, implementation, and limited efficacy. The primary outcome of interest will be viral suppression.  The proposed behavioral-medical intervention will be guided by Self-Determination Theory. In addition, the intervention will be developed using an implementation science framework, the Damschroer's Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, in order to promote sustainability and dissemination. This research reduces disparities in treatment outcomes in a severely underserved population of PLWH and will provide rigorous training and study in implementation science. This work is novel in that it: focuses on an underserved population, incorporates job readiness into HIV retention in care, and is guided by Self- Determination Theory. This research career development award will provide training to the recipient in the following three areas: implementation science, intervention development, and experimental design. This training will allow the recipient to achieve her career goal of conducting independent research to develop, test, and study the implementation of HIV prevention programs for underserved populations. Project Narrative Retention in HIV care is important for the health of people living with HIV as well as for reduction of HIV transmissions. Black men who have sex with men are one of the populations most disproportionately burdened by HIV.

"Technology Based Community Health Nursing to Improve cART Adherence and Virologic Suppression in Youth Living with HIV (TechN 2 CheckIN): A Regional Multi-site Study Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has disproportionately persisted as a public health threat to adolescents and young adults (AYA) from minority communities in the United States. HIV has evolved into a chronic disease, which can be managed in the outpatient setting with antiretroviral therapy (ART) designed to achieve virologic suppression and life expectancy equivalent for uninfected individuals. However, for AYA, huge disparities exist compared to adults, with greater proportions unaware of their status, lower rates of care engagement, retention, and initiation and maintenance of ART, resulting in higher rates of virologic non- suppression, and development of sequelae including immunologic deterioration and transmission. Interventions designed to improve outcomes for youth living with HIV (YLHIV) are being sponsored by agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, however, most target the early components of the continuum of care (identification, linkage, and ART initiation). Our research from the HIV Research Network shows that 30-40% of YLHIV are not virologically suppressed despite being in care, highlighting the need for novel interventions targeting the distal components of the care continuum. Community health nurse (CHN) interventions have been shown to increase access to appropriate resources, enhance health care utilization, and promote risk-reducing behavior among AYA. Use of short messaging service (SMS) messaging can further enhance clinical care by improving attendance at medical visits, medication adherence, and communication with the health care team. We have used these two modalities in randomized trials of youth with complex sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in low-income minority communities with high feasibility and acceptability amongst AYA and their families, remarkable improvements in visit completion, medication adherence, and reduction in recurrent STIs. The overarching goal of this project is to build on the evidence from this trial and to repurpose the intervention for YLHIV in the same community who are having challenges with care and medication non-adherence. We aim to compare the effectiveness of a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention (TECH-N 2 CHECK-IN) to a standard of care control group using a randomized trial design. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will result in higher rates of adherence to ART and virologic suppression. We have demonstrated our interdisciplinary team's capacity to follow urban AYA in the community, utilizing the combination of CHNs and outreach workers to optimize care according to national standards. TECH-IN 2 CHECK-IN aims to enroll 120 YLHIV followed at clinics specializing in HIV care in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan area who are challenged with treatment adherence and randomizing them to receive TECH-IN 2 CHECK-IN vs. standard of care. Results of this trial will inform best practices for engaging YLHIV by addressing the distal component of the continuum, critical to achieving the elusive 90-90-90 HIV goals.  Project Relevance Despite advances in HIV treatment, youth living with HIV (YLHIV) have profound challenges with adherence to care visits and antiretroviral therapy (ART), with 1/3 of YLHIV who are in care not reaching virologic suppression; however, few evidence-based interventions have been developed or studied that can improve these rates. We will repurpose a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention (TECH-N) with demonstrated efficacy for improving care adherence and reducing risk behaviors among youth from similar racial/ethnic, socioeconomic status and community backgrounds into an HIV-focused intervention (TECH-N 2 CHECK-IN) and use a randomized controlled trial design to compare it to standard of care for YLHIV who are non-adherent to care and ART using data on medication adherence, virologic suppression, and cost- effectiveness. If successful, this study will provide critical data to support the need for comprehensive, higher intensity community-based nursing services that leverage mHealth to assist the subset of the mostly racial/ethnic minority YLHIV who are challenged by the complexity of HIV care and to introduce a novel strategy to move the United States closer to meeting our 2020 National Health Objectives by embracing the United Nations 90-90-90 goals focused on effective treatment of YLHIV to end AIDS.",Technology Based Community Health Nursing to Improve cART Adherence and Virologic Suppression in Youth

"Addressing Barriers to Retention in HIV Care for Hispanic Immigrants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient engagement in HIV care encompasses a cascade of events from HIV diagnosis to retention in care. Each step is vital in achieving the goal of virologic suppression and improved health outcomes. Compromising this clinical imperative is the nearly 50% of HIV-infected individuals in the US who are not in continuous HIV care. The HIV epidemic poses a particularly severe problem in Hispanic populations. While Hispanics comprise 16% of the US population, they comprise 20% of new HIV infections. Immigrants make up 42% of new HIV diagnoses in Hispanics. Emerging interventions to improve retention in HIV care in the general HIV-infected population have not been adequately studied in Hispanic immigrants, a growing segment of the population where risk for poor outcomes is a precarious reality. Factors specific both to Hispanic cultures and to immigrant status are essential to highlight for effective intervention development. A better understanding of these factors could lead to improved, tailored approaches to retention in HIV care for Hispanic immigrants, improvement in health outcomes, and a reduction in ongoing HIV transmission. CANDIDATE: My specialized training in clinical infectious disease, public health, and Hispanic studies, coupled with extensive resources at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), uniquely position me to accomplish these aims. I have five peer-reviewed research articles directly related to HIV outcomes and the consequences of adherence to care in resource-limited settings, and extensive clinical experience caring for HIV-infected individuals as well as immigrants. RESEARCH: I will conduct formative qualitative research with Hispanic immigrants infected with HIV and their medical providers to understand factors (e.g. individual preferences, structural barriers) and agents (e.g. role of the family) that influence decision-making around retention in primary HIV care. I will give specific attention to generating novel intervention ideas to improve retention in HIV care through these in-depth interviews with patients and the multi-disciplinary providers within an HIV provider team including physicians, nurses, social workers, case managers, and community health workers (Aim 1). I will expand the Andersen Model of Health Services Use to include conceptual models of health disparities in order to evaluate societal, clinic/system- level, and individual determinants of HIV care utilization. Guided by this conceptual model, formative research, and community stakeholder feedback, we will identify the most significant and modifiable factors that determine retention in HIV care for the study population in order to inform the development of an intervention. We will develop and pilot test a culturally-tailored intervention (Aim 2). The intervention will target Hispanic immigrants who are not retained in HIV care, and for whom there are limited culturally relevant interventions. We will intervene at a particularly vulnerable period in the HIV care cascade, retention in care, where care interruption poses substantial consequences for both the individual, due to risk of clinical decline and risk-taking behaviors, and for public health, due threat of resulting HIV transmission. Standardization of the intervention will occur through iterative refinements based on participant and community advisory board feedback. Through a focused randomized pilot trial (Aim 3), we will further refine study procedures and perform preliminary power analyses in preparation for a larger, more definitive test of the intervention directed through submission of an R01 proposal at the end of the award. TRAINING/MENTORING: My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing culturally-tailored community-based interventions to improve outcomes in HIV and other chronic diseases for vulnerable populations. I will need rigorous training in methodologies that will enable me to fully capture factors, such as culture and context, and processes, such as acculturation, that influence use of HIV care for Hispanic immigrants. Training in community-engaged methods will facilitate effective development and deployment of novel interventions in the community setting. To complement my prior training in clinical care and HIV outcomes research, I have outlined a plan for intensive training in community-based participatory research, qualitative research, behavioral theory, and intervention development. This training will occur through graduate-level coursework as well as through intensive supervision with my mentors, who are internationally- recognized leaders in areas of research directly related to the proposal. My mentorship team also has a strong foothold in community-based partnerships for research and HIV care delivery in Massachusetts and nationally. Furthermore, this project advances the institutional strategic priorities of the CDC, NIMH and the Office of AIDS Research, notably, to reduce HIV health disparities and to improve medical care for people living with HIV. The successful completion of this research will position me as an expert in retention in care for HIV-infected Hispanic immigrants, and more generally will enable me to address challenges in vulnerable populations burdened with chronic illnesses that require innovative models for disease management. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of the 1.2 million HIV-infected individuals in the US, nearly 50% are not engaged in regular HIV care and 80% do not show viral load suppression, a marker of HIV treatment success. Among Hispanic patients with HIV, immigrants represent 40% of new HIV cases, an important public health disparity that reflects a confluence of ill-defined risks and barriers to health care. This Career Development Award will address the knowledge gap in barriers to retention in HIV care for Hispanic immigrants, and will leverage this information to develop and pilot test culturally-relevant approaches to improve retention in care, a critical yet underdeveloped area of public health research.",Addressing Barriers to Retention in HIV Care for Hispanic

"Disparities in the HIV Care Continuum among Hispanics in the United States ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic has disproportionately affected the Hispanic population in the United States (US). Hispanics face the second-highest prevalence and incidence rates of HIV. Hispanics are also more likely to receive HIV care at later stages of HIV disease progression relative to any other racial or ethnic group. A complex set of unique individual- and structural-level factors confront this population and contribute to the burden of health disparities in HIV care and treatment experienced by Hispanics. In 2015, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States: Updated to 2020 (NHAS) set forth goals to reduce HIV-related disparities in high-risk populations, such as Hispanics, and to increase the proportion of individuals successfully engaged at all levels of the spectrum of HIV care and treatment. This spectrum, termed the HIV care continuum (HIVCC), has become a high-priority area for intervention. Increasing the proportions of HIV-infected individuals who progress through and ultimately reach the last stage of the HIVCC (viral suppression) has been shown to prevent over 90% of new HIV infections. To address the Hispanic population's unique HIV-related needs, it is critical to monitor trends in HIV care indicators for improvement over time and to identify the factors underlying HIV care in this population for the development of tailored public health interventions. We aim to: 1) estimate trends in the proportion of adult Hispanics that were in the last three steps of the HIVCC (retention in HIV care, prescription of antiretrovirl therapy [ART], and viral suppression) from 2004 to 2014; 2) identify demographic factors and behavioral targets for interventions to improve retention in HIV care, ART use, and viral suppression among Hispanic adults in HIV care in the US; and 3) explore the nature of progression through the last three steps of the HIVCC among adult Hispanics and identify the structural-level barriers and facilitators influencing this progression using qualitative research methods. For Aims 1 and 2, we will use data from the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD). The NA-ACCORD offers the largest-available source of longitudinal data on HIV- infected Hispanics (>15,000) in the US and has been endorsed by the Institute of Medicine as an appropriate data source for monitoring progress in NHAS goals. We will conduct qualitative in-depth interviews (N=25) with HIV-infected Hispanics in Baltimore City in Aim 3 to obtain a rich, complementary understanding of structural- level factors influencing HIVCC proportions among Hispanics. The results of this research will inform strategies designed to achieve NHAS goals to reduce health disparities and improve HIV care among Hispanics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics in the United States face unique, complex challenges to HIV prevention, medical care, and treatment, demonstrating the imperative need for public health interventions that are specifically tailored to this important population. The results of the proposed research will provide a strong basis with which to inform interventions designed to reduce persistent HIV-related health disparities by increasing the proportion of Hispanics that are retained in HIV clinical care, are prescribed antiretroviral therapy, and ultimately achieve HIV viral suppression. Increased rates of viral suppression among Hispanics will, in turn, contribute to reduced HIV transmission and improved HIV-related health outcomes in this population.        ",Disparities in the HIV Care Continuum among Hispanics in the United States,9293885,F31AI124794,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Baltimore ', ' Cities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Persons ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' virology ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nature ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Viral ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Population Attributable Risks ', ' attributable fraction ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' public health intervention ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,49044,0.24263908330845893
"Development of a Couple-Based Mobile Health Intervention for Enhancing HIV Care Engagement Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to other racial/ethnic groups in the US, Black men who have sex with men (MSM), once diagnosed, are less likely to be optimally engaged in HIV care and treatment. This undermines the promise of recent prevention approaches for reducing the disproportionate effects of HIV/AIDS on Black communities, emphasizing the urgency for increased research focus and intervention development. Understanding HIV care engagement in the context of the dyad may be part of a comprehensive effort to addressing multilevel influences on HIV care engagement outcomes that are unique to HIV+ Black MSM towards achieving the maximum public health benefit of treatment-as-prevention. However, the scarcity of dyad-level research limits our understanding of couple dynamics involved in HIV care engagement to inform intervention development targeting the couple, underscoring the need for couple-based studies of relational dynamics important to the HIV care engagement of the HIV+ partner(s). Mobile technology-based strategies (mHealth) offer tremendous potential as an acceptable, feasible, and effective intervention platform for enhancing HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black MSM in couples by facilitating couple dynamics optimal to HIV care engagement. Further, mHealth offers potential in addressing limitations in previous intervention research with couples, one of which is the dissipation of intervention effects over time due to absence of booster sessions. Therefore, the aims of the study are to: elucidate the effects of couple dynamics on HIV care engagement among partnered synthesize the quantitative and qualitative (mixed methods) outcomes from Aim 1 to identify the issues the intervention will target, and to iteratively determine core components of a couple-based intervention for HIV+ Black MSM (Aim 2); and develop a novel, technology-based intervention prototype for enhancing HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black MSM in couples (Aim 3). HIV+ Black MSM (Aim 1); The overall objective of this application is to achieve a better understanding of the couple dynamics involved in HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black men in same-sex relationships. The end goal is the development of an mHealth tool that targets couple dynamics important to enhancing HIV care engagement. Through these aims, I will acquire additional training necessary for my career development in (a) theory and mixed methods for conducting couple-based research, (b) formative research in intervention development, and (c) prototype design. These research and career development activities will build the foundation to my becoming an independent, NIH-funded investigator with skills to conduct couple-based intervention research that is part of a comprehensive effort in HIV prevention integrating advances in technology and behavioral medicine to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV/AIDS among Black men is a US public health crisis, emphasizing the urgency for increased research focus and intervention development. The overall objective of this application is to achieve a better understanding of the couple dynamics involved in HIV care engagement among partnered HIV+ Black men.

"Improving Health Outcomes for Women Living with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Globally, transgender (`trans') women have 49 times higher odds of HIV infection compared to other groups and trans women living with HIV (TWH) access HIV care and adhere to medication at significantly lower rates than other at-risk groups. Poor engagement in HIV care for TWH is a result of reduced access to and avoidance of healthcare due to stigma and negative experiences with providers, and occurs in the context of social and economic marginalization that foments unstable employment and housing, familial alienation, limited social support, and substance abuse. Interventions to mitigate these barriers to care are critical to reducing HIV-related disparities and poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable population, particularly where disparities are most apparent, including Brazil. Peer-based navigation (PN) interventions have demonstrated success in improving engagement in HIV care in low-resource settings. Our research group is currently conducting a PN intervention (`I-Care') in rural South Africa that significantly improved both linkage to care and retention for men and women. While the PN intervention addresses HIV care engagement by providing social support and skills to work with health providers and family, it requires specific adaptation and a conceptual model that addresses the unique needs of TWH identified during formative research and in consultations with Brazilian stakeholders in 2015. We propose to develop and conduct a trans-specific PN intervention in Brazil, tentatively named `TransAmigas', which integrates the I-Care approach with the Model of Gender Affirmation (GA), developed by our research team to specifically address HIV prevention and care among trans women. We will use the ADAPT-ITT methodology to develop TransAmigas, incorporating the GA model in the Brazilian context (Aim 1). We will then conduct a pilot study to test the feasibility and acceptability of TransAmigas in São Paulo, Brazil (Aim 2) by randomizing TWH to the intervention (n=100) or to clinical referral (n=50). During the nine month pilot, we will track both navigator and patient adherence to the program, recruitment needs, cohort retention, and reported satisfaction and preferences for program content through surveys at baseline and nine months. Finally, we will prepare for a multi-site efficacy trial (Aim 3) by extracting clinical data from participants' records at the referral clinic, generating preliminary efficacy data by comparing retention in HIV care and viral load by intervention arm. Clinical data will inform future trial sample size. We will implement this study in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where universal access to care and public support for gender transition care provide an enabling environment for this work to be most effective and where the team has established academic partnerships and a collaboration with the State-run reference and training clinical site (CRT), which includes trans-specific clinical services. If feasible, acceptable, and ultimately proven efficacious, TransAmigas will be the first evidence-based HIV care intervention for TWH globally – filling a crucial gap in programming. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peer Navigation (PN) that is integrated with gender affirming programming for transgender women living with HIV (TWH) could significantly improve HIV care engagement and health outcomes in this population that suffers a disproportionate burden of HIV. This study, which will be implemented in São Paulo, Brazil, aims to integrate a successful PN model with the trans-specific Model of Gender Affirmation and then pilot the intervention using a randomized design. We will determine the acceptability and feasibility of this intervention for improving health outcomes among TWH, and glean needed information to prepare for a multi-site trial. There are currently no interventions proven to increase retention in HIV care and reduce viral load for TWH; as a result, this work will fill a large gap in evidence-based continuum of care

"A Mobile Health Application for Engagement in Care among Youth Living with HIV Abstract/Project Summary:  In the US, fewer than 6% of all youth living with HIV (YLWH) achieve HIV viral suppression. This health disparity extends to the entire HIV care continuum in that there is a strong association between younger age and later HIV diagnosis, lower engagement in care, lower levels of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, and worse HIV clinical outcomes. In response to this critical public health dilemma and aligned with the National Institute of Health's High Priority Topics of Research (i.e., “to reduce health disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections or in treatment outcomes of those living with HIV/AIDS”), our research team proposes to develop a novel mobile health application (“app”) to improve engagement in health care and ART adherence and to pilot test this mobile health app in 18-29 year-old YLWH. The aims of our study are to: Aim 1: Build on our theory-guided model and formative work to complete the development of our novel personalized mobile health app, WYZ (pronounced “wise”), for improved HIV clinical outcomes among YLWH. Our research team will work with the University of California, San Francisco's Information Services Unit to complete the development of WYZ using an iterative Human-Centered Design approach. This will be done by adding data integration with pharmacy and laboratory databases, creation of an Android-compatible version of the app based on our in-progress iOS version, refinement based on user-experience data from field testing, and qualitative interviews with the primary care providers of the youth participating in the field testing. Aim 2: Conduct a pilot randomized trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical impact (i.e., adherence, plasma HIV RNA, and CD4+ cell count) of the use of WYZ among YLWH and their HCPs. Aim 2 consists of two sub-aims: 2a. Examine feasibility and acceptability of the use of WYZ based on defined metrics, acceptability through qualitative exit interviews, and preliminary clinical impact by virologic/immunologic outcomes with participants randomized to the intervention versus the wait-list control. 2b. Assess the acceptability of WYZ by participants' HCPs through individual qualitative interviews.  We hypothesize that our mobile health app will be feasible and acceptable and will result in improved HIV clinical outcomes. Our study is significant because it has the potential to improve engagement in care, ART adherence, and clinical outcomes among YLWH. Our study is innovative because we will employ a novel suite of technology-based methods to improve information, motivation, and behavioral skills in YLWH. Upon completion, we will be ready to test the efficacy of this app in a subsequent large-scale RCT among this population that is disproportionately impacted by HIV and at elevated risk for poor clinical outcomes. Narrative: The research in this R34 proposal is relevant because: (1) it will complete the development of our novel personalized mobile health app for improved HIV clinical outcomes among youth living with HIV; (2) it will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical impact of the use of this app among youth living with HIV in a 12-month pilot randomized trial; and (3) it will examine the acceptability of this app by participants' healthcare providers.",A Mobile Health Application for Engagement in Care among Youth Living with HIV,9404104,R34MH114604,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Awareness ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Focus Groups ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Services ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' San Francisco ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' virology ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Adolescent Medicine Trials Network ', ' Adolescent Trials Network ', ' health application ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' health information technology ', ' population health ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' tailored health care ', ' tailored healthcare ', ' Android ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R34,2017,277375,0.08180582925160193
"FANMI: Community Cohort Care for HIV-Infected Adolescent Girls in Haiti Abstract: Sexually active HIV-infected adolescent girls are an extremely vulnerable and underserved population. If treated promptly with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and retained in care, individuals have a near normal life expectancy. Further, ART will decrease vertical and sexual HIV transmission in a population who are sexually active, have high rates of pregnancy and multiple seronegative partners. However, in Haiti and other resource poor countries, HIV-infected adolescents are three times more likely to be lost from care than adults, with only approximately 50% of HIV-infected teens remaining in care at one year. We have developed FANMI (My Family), an innovative model to improve HIV care for adolescent girls. HIV- infected girls age 16-19 years attend monthly HIV care in cohorts of 5-8 peers. All HIV care takes place in a community center rather than in a medical clinic. Each monthly visit integrates clinical care, peer group counseling, and social activities in a single session by the same provider to simplify care and strengthen the relationships between peers and providers. Preliminary data from our pilot study suggest dramatic improvements in retention with 91% of girls remaining in care at one year. Primary Aim: To conduct a randomized controlled trial at the GHESKIO Center in Port au Prince, Haiti. We will randomize 160 HIV-infected girls age 16-19 years (80 per arm) to FANMI versus standard of care with the primary study endpoint being alive and in care at 12 months. We will have >80% power to detect an improvement in retention at 12 months from 60% in the standard group to 85% in FANMI. Secondary Aims: To compare FANMI versus standard care on the following outcomes:  a. Plasma HIV-1 RNA < 1000 copies/µl at 12 months. We predict that 30% of participants in the standard  arm will have a suppressed viral load at 12 months compared to 60% in the FAMNI arm due to improved  retention, increased visit attendance, and improved ART adherence.  b. Sexual risk behavior: self-reported sexual activity, condom use, incidence of sexually-transmitted infections,  and pregnancy rate over 12 months.  c. Acceptability: We will conduct in-depth interviews to evaluate FANMI and factors associated with retention.  d. Health care utilization and costs of FANMI versus standard care. FANMI has the potential to dramatically improve HIV-infected adolescent treatment outcomes across the HIV care cascade and serve as a model of adolescent HIV care in Haiti and other resource-poor countries. NARRATIVE Retention of adolescents in HIV care is essential for prevention of morbidity, mortality, and HIV transmission, but in Haiti, HIV-infected adolescents are three times more likely to be lost from HIV care than adults, with only 50% of HIV-infected teens remaining in care at one year.

"Social Capital and Engagement in Care Among Young Black Men who have Sex with Men Living with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Nationally, over one-quarter of new HIV infections occur in adolescents and young adults, and the brunt of this youth epidemic is being borne by young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). HIV-positive YBMSM are additionally at high risk for suboptimal engagement in care, which has implications for individual morbidity and mortality as well as further transmission within the community. At the same time, prior work has demonstrated significant resilience and supportive social relationships among HIV-positive YBMSM. The unique strengths and vulnerabilities of YBMSM must be better understood in order to develop effective interventions that improve individual and public health outcomes. This proposal outlines an approach that seeks to integrate community-based participatory research with clinical research methods in order to understand the relationships between social network characteristics and engagement in HIV care among YBMSM. Specifically, we will focus on characterizing and augmenting YBMSM’s social capital, which we define as the sum of actual and potential resources contained in an individual’s social network. We will first conduct formative research with HIV-positive YBMSM as well as key informants from the community, to better understand the sources and characteristics of social capital among YBMSM. Next, with the guidance of a youth community advisory board, we will develop an intervention to augment social capital among HIV-positive YBMSM by engaging them in group projects aimed at community- oriented action. Finally, we will pilot test our intervention in a randomized controlled trial and assess its feasibility and acceptability as well as its impact on social capital and HIV care engagement outcomes. We are proposing a unique, strengths-based approach to augmenting HIV care engagement among YBMSM, and we believe that our utilization of community-based participatory methods will lead to the development of an intervention which is acceptable and sustainable in this population. Such novel strategies for improving engagement in care among YBMSM are critically needed to promote individual health and well-being, prevent secondary transmission, and decrease health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Innovative strategies are needed to promote engagement in HIV care among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). Social capital, which refers to the sum of an individual’s resource-containing network connections, has been proposed as a positive influence on engagement in care among people living with HIV. We therefore propose to develop and test a novel group-based intervention to enhance social capital and HIV care engagement among YBMSM utilizing a participatory, youth-centered approach to encourage community- oriented action.",Social Capital and Engagement in Care Among Young Black Men who have Sex with Men Living with HIV,9431052,U01PS005112,[''],NCHHSTP,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,319733,0.1198741796485349
"Effect of Peer Navigation and Contingency Management on Retention in HIV Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Consistent treatment with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral load (VL), prolonging life and improving quality of life for HIV+ persons. Suppressing VL benefits communities by reducing transmission to others. Mere availability of ART and care, however, is insufficient; the benefits of ART depend upon HIV+ persons' continuous visits to the health care provider, regular monitoring and regular delivery of medications, - known as retention in HIV care. In spite of national efforts, up to a quarter of HIV+ persons, especially low- income minorities, are out of care. Innovative interventions are therefore urgently needed to maximize engagement and retention in HIV care, self-reported adherence, as well as HIV-1 RNA viral load suppression. In pursuit of these aims, the proposed study will assess outcomes of the following interventions in comparison to usual care: 1) contingency management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that integrates both CM and PN (CA).  The interventions will then be implemented and evaluated in a fully powered Randomized Control Trial (RCT) using 1) contingency management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that integrates both CM and PN (CA).  to examine the effect of the interventions (CM and PN) compared to one another, to their combination (CA) and to usual care. A total of 660 inadequately retained individuals (165/group) will be recruited from publically-funded clinics providing HIV Care in Los Angeles County (LAC). These 495 intervention and 165 controls will be assessed through interviews, VL tests and electronic record review for HIV care visits. The evaluation will address retention in HIV care, use of ART medications, and viral load suppression outcomes, as well as intermediate variables, such as barriers to care, substance use, mental health, social support, self-efficacy, knowledge, stigma, and other factors that may affect the effectiveness of the intervention. We will also assess the costs of the intervention and potential cost savings from long-term intervention outcomes (cost offset and cost-effectiveness). If shown to be effective and cost-effective, this study could have substantial, widespread impact on both individual and public health in Los Angeles and other major metropolitan areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research strongly suggests that racial and ethnic disparities substantially and persistently affect retention in HIV care rates. In order to improve both individual and community HIV prevention and care outcomes, innovative interventions are urgently needed to target the underlying factors that contribute to these disparities in care. We therefore propose to evaluate the effectiveness of two distinct and promising cognitive behavioral strategy interventions: Peer Navigation (PN) and Contingency Management (CM), and their combination to optimize retention in HIV care among a vulnerable population of HIV+ individuals served by a safety net health care system that includes the second largest epicenter of HIV+ persons in

"Disparities in Nursing Home Care Quality for Patients Living with HIV/AIDS Project Summary Thanks to the success of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US are living longer, and aging. With this success comes the new challenge of meeting the increasing need for nursing home (NH) care. Caring for these patients is complex. Aging PLWH experience complications of HIV and ART, high rates of HIV-Associated Non-AIDS conditions such as liver and lung disease, and high rates mental health disorders. Most NH providers have little experience caring for persons with this combination of medical issues. Unfortunately, very little is known about NH care for PLWH, such as what facilities they are admitted to, the quality of the care they receive, and the outcomes of that care. Absent such information it will not be possible to prepare and train NH staff to effectively and efficiently care for the large numbers of aging PLWH who in the next decade will need their care. The long term goal of this research is to drive the development of efficient, high quality NH care for PLWH. The objective of this application, the first step toward this long term goal, is to assemble and analyze national, population based data about the quality of, and variations in, NH care for PLWH. The central hypothesis motivating this proposal is that there are disparities in NH care for PLWH. We hypothesize, first, that PLWHs are likely to be admitted to lower quality NHs (“between” NH effects), and, second, that they are likely to get poorer care than HIV negative (HIV-) patients in those NHs (“within” NH effects). These hypotheses are based on several observations, including that disparities in care have been consistently found for PLWH, that hospitalization rates for HIV in the ART era have fallen so most NHs have not needed to learn how to provide post-acute (i.e., post-hospital) care for PLWH, and that there are volume- outcome relationships have been previously demonstrated in HIV care. The rationale for this work is that it will provide an evidence base for interventions to improve the quality of NH care for PLWH. The sample for this project will include PLWH admitted to NHs in nine high HIV prevalence states between 2001 and 2012, including those with Medicaid, Medicare, and Dual Eligibles. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Compare indicators of overall quality of NHs that have low, medium, and high experience caring for PLWH. 2) Compare the quality of care experienced by Medicaid HIV+ and HIV- patients in low, medium, and high HIV experience NHs. 3) Identify education, training, and attitudinal factors related to HIV care that differentiate high and low experience and high and low quality NHs from each other. We will accomplish this through qualitative interviews with Directors of Nursing from NHs selected based on findings from Aims 1-2. This approach is innovative because we propose is new ways to understand disparities in NH care for PLWH. The approach is significant because population-based data about the quality of care in the post-acute care sector for patients with HIV is a necessary precondition for evidence based clinical and policy interventions aimed at achieving the triple aim of better care, better health, and lower cost. PROJECT NARRATIVE Because of the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies (ART), patients with HIV infection are living longer. However, HIV infection and chronic ART use, in combination with the normal aging process, are producing new kinds of morbidity and disability for persons with HIV, including hospitalizations and the need for post- hospital or post-acute care. Understanding more about the quality and outcomes of post-acute care for persons with HIV can contribute in important ways to improving care quality, reducing the burdens of illness and disability, reducing disparities, and decreasing care costs for persons with HIV.",Disparities in Nursing Home Care Quality for Patients Living with HIV/AIDS,9313931,R01MH109394,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Liver diseases ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' hepatic disease ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nurse Administrator ', ' Vice President for Nursing ', ' Nurse Executive ', ' Director of Nursing ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' meetings ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' success ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV therapy ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' Nursing Home Nursing ', ' Long-Term Care Nursing ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' dual eligible ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' normal aging ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' HIV antiretroviral ', ' HIV anti-retroviral ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,606726,0.05742021708285582
"Evaluating ART for All HIV Seropositives: Can it work with the hardest cases? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On World AIDS Day, December 1, 2011, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) announced a new policy that all HIV seropositives should be offered antiretroviral treatment (ART) regardless of CD4 cell count. The new policy was based primarily on ""treatment as prevention"" as a method for not only improving the health of people living with HIV who initiate ART early, but also as a means of reducing transmission of the virus. The NYCDOHMH set an ambitious goal for this new policy: by one year post HIV diagnosis, 80% of new HIV diagnoses will have reached viral suppression. There are over 3,400 new HIV infections occurring annually in NYC; recent data indicate 38% reached durable viral suppression in 2006-07 (i.e., all viral loads 400 copies/mL). The policy goal is ambitious, but if it were to be achieved, it would almost certainly lead to an ""AIDS-free generation"" - the central theme of the 2012 International AIDS Conference - in the city with the largest local HIV epidemic in the US. There are serious difficulties in achieving this policy goal, notably the persistent racial/ethnic disparities in HIV infection in the city, especially among African-Americans, and drug-related sexual transmission. The overarching purpose of this research is to provide multisystem data to evaluate the implementation of the policy and help determine the most efficient use of available resources for achieving the policy goal. The design and methods are informed by the ecological systems model, while the RE-AIM model guides the overall assessment of the implementation of the new policy. The study aims are: 1) to assess durable viral suppression (i.e., two consecutive viral load tests 400 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL of plasma) within 12 months of diagnosis among a) STD clinic cohort (N = 300) with problem substance use, and b) all new HIV diagnoses in NYC occurring during the project funding period (N=approximately 3,400/year); 2) to assess key indicators along the HIV treatment cascade among the STD clinic cohort as the percentage who (a) link to HIV care; (b) receive a recommendation to initiate ART; (c) initiate ART treatment; and (d) adhere to ART treatment; 3) to assess multisystem predictors of durable viral load suppression and other HIV treatment cascade indicators among the STD clinic cohort and cohort of all new HIV diagnoses in NYC, to include individual (e.g., race/ethnicity, substance use) and geospatial factors (e.g., socioeconomic conditions, social disorder, social cohesion, and spatial access to HIV-related healthcare); 4) to describe and contextualize quantitative outcomes in Aims 1-3 using STD cohort qualitative data; and 5) to describe the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of HIV treatment policies among HIV primary care providers. The endpoint of durable viral suppression increases public health relevance as the primary indicator of HIV transmission risk. Data will be used to inform further implementation of the new policy, and in particular, to guide allocation of resources to reach the policy goal. Recommendations will be produced by a Collaborative Board comprised of community stakeholders and clinical researchers.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) has adopted a policy of offering anti- retroviral treatment (ART) to all newly diagnosed HIV seropositive persons, regardless of CD4 count, with a goal of reaching viral suppression in 80% of HIV seropositive persons within 12 months of diagnosis. If this ambitious policy goal can be achieved, it would be a major step towards an ""AIDS-free generation"" in the US city with the largest AIDS epidemic. The proposed research will evaluate the implementation of this policy, conducted in partnership with the DOHMH, and with recommendations for improvements informed through continuous feedback from a community collaborative board.",Evaluating ART for All HIV Seropositives: Can it work with the hardest cases?,9036976,R01DA035707,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Adoption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' cohesion ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Data ', ' International AIDS ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment adherence ', ' surveillance data ', ' viral transmission ', ' virus transmission ', ' illicit drug use ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NIDA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,599395,0.0783636202126265
"Youth Services Navigation Intervention for HIV+ adolescents and young adults being released from incarceration: A randomized control trial Project Summary/Abstract The continuum of HIV care has forced new focus on the urgency to identify and effectively serve high-need, under-resourced, and often transient populations to facilitate their receiving the necessary ongoing care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress HIV RNA viral load (VL). Crucial target groups for improving care along the continuum are young (aged 16-25), sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations being released from jail settings. HIV prevalence among incarcerated youth living with HIV (YLWH) is three times that of the general population and one in seven of all HIV+ persons experience incarceration each year. HIV incidence, prevalence, and incarceration rates are higher for blacks and Latinos than for any other group – these disparities are especially prominent among youth. Furthermore, only an estimated 6% of HIV+ youth are virally suppressed, due to poor retention and adherence to ART. Existing linkage and retention services are insufficient to meet the acute needs of criminal justice-involved (CJI) HIV+ youth, particularly in the high-need period following release from incarceration. Moreover, because of their lack of experience, many youths may struggle to obtain needed services and stabilize their living conditions. Disparities in HIV continuum outcomes are inextricably linked to incarceration, substance use disorders (SUDs), homelessness, and mental health (MH) problems among YLWH. If HIV is to be controlled and the benefits of ART experienced broadly, the problems of CJI YLWH must be addressed with innovative, youth-, and sexual and gender minority (SGM)- sensitive approaches. We propose to enroll 240 CJI YLWH, aged 16-25, incarcerated in Los Angeles and Chicago jails and juvenile detention facilities. We will randomize participants to the YSN intervention (n=120) vs. a usual-care control group (n=120). The youth services navigators (YSNs) will assist with addressing immediate unmet needs such as housing, transportation, and food prior to clinical care and ongoing; will guide intervention participants to a range of community services to support progress along the continuum of HIV care; and will provide direct ART adherence support. The proposed study has two Primary Specific Aims: 1. Adapt an existing peer navigation intervention for adults to create a Youth Service Navigation (YSN) intervention sensitive to SGM culture that guides youth to needed services along the continuum of HIV care. This intervention combines medical, substance use and mental health care with comprehensive reentry support for CJI YLWH, aged 16-25 upon release from large county jails and juvenile detention systems; 2. Using a two-group RCT design, we will test the effectiveness of the new YSN, youth SGM-sensitive intervention among CJI YLWH aged 16-25, compared to controls offered standard referrals to services. We will evaluate the YSN Intervention's effect on post-incarceration linkage, retention, adherence, and viral suppression, as well as on SUDs, mental health, services utilization, and met needs. Secondary Aims: We will assess YSN's effects on recidivism, costs and potential cost-offset/effectiveness.   Public Health Relevance Crucial target groups for improving care along the Continuum of Care are young (aged 16-25) HIV+ sexual and gender minority youths with criminal-justice involvement (CJI) – a population that is poorly retained in HIV care. If HIV is to be controlled and the benefits of ART advances experienced broadly, the problems of CJI young people living with HIV must be addressed with innovative, youth-, and sexual and gender minority-sensitive approaches. The proposed Youth Services Navigation intervention will address this gap, testing a youth- focused approach that is adapted from our successful intervention with HIV+ CJI adults.",Youth Services Navigation Intervention for HIV+ adolescents and young adults being released from incarceration: A randomized control trial,9395728,R01MD011773,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Chicago ', ' Community Health Services ', ' Community Services ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Control Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Housing ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Los Angeles ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Persons ', ' Probability ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' viral RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Shelter facility ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Gays ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' recidivism ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' contingency management ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' community re-entry ', ' community reentry ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' service utilization ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' successful intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' trial design ', ' navigator intervention ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,708966,0.09846469205675178

"The AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) represent a marginalized population with substantial disparities in health care access and outcomes. Since 1988, the AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) study has followed disadvantaged, predominantly African American HIV-infected and at-risk IDUs in a community-based observational cohort, providing important evidence on the natural and treated course of HIV among IDUs. We have characterized the rates and risk factors for incident HIV infection and for progression to AIDS or death, described patterns of risk behavior, and determined barriers to optimal HIV care. Since availability of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), optimal HIV care is now achieved by early HIV testing; prompt linkage to HIV care, timely initiation of ART, high adherence, retention in care, and prolonged virological suppression. Drug use may have detrimental effects at each stage of this HIV Care Continuum. Proposed is a multidisciplinary research agenda with the primary objective to continue the epidemiological, pathogenesis, behavioral, and clinical characterization of the evolving HIV epidemic among IDUs as they age and drug use patterns change. While the cohort has and continues to be a platform for an array of studies critical to addressing critical on HIV and drug use, this proposal emphasizes examination of IDUs' navigation of the HIV Care Continuum. We aim to characterize the dynamic nature of the Care Continuum and to identify the key determinants of successful navigation and the consequences of stagnation. Successful navigation entails consistent engagement in care with prompt ART initiation and prolonged viral suppression. In contrast, we introduce the concept of stagnation, incorporating navigation patterns involving a failure to progress and delayed or relapsing transitions through the Continuum. We will describe longitudinal navigation patterns, characterize the time required to transition through stages, and identify sociodemographic, behavioral, provider and neighborhood-level determinants of the primary navigation patterns. We hypothesize that less successful navigation (stagnation) in the Care Continuum will have serious clinical consequences, increasing the risk for both AIDS or non-AIDS events as well as death. The key impact of this aim is to illuminate mechanisms, identify modifiable risk factors, and provide novel insight to inform efficient and targeted intervention development to mitigate the consequences of less effective HIV care among IDUs. To achieve these aims, we continue biannual visits with interview, exam, and biospecimen collection supplemented by medical record review and registry linkage. ALIVE represents the minority, socially-marginalized population at highest risk for HIV progression and limited access to care in Baltimore and nationally. The ALIVE study remains well- positioned to address these emerging issues confronting aging HIV-infected IDUs, namely characterizing long- term outcomes and enhancing HIV care through improving navigation of the HIV Care Continuum. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal supports continuation of the AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) study which has followed disadvantaged, predominantly African American HIV-infected and at-risk injection drug users (IDUs) in a community-based cohort since 1988. ALIVE provides a platform for longitudinally measuring risk behavior, treatment outcomes, disease incidence and prevalence, and cause-specific mortality among aging HIV-infected IDUs while also supporting independently-funded investigations of HIV and drug use. Focusing on how IDUs' navigate the HIV Care Continuum, we aim to understand mechanisms, identify modifiable risk factors, and inform intervention development to improve the effectiveness of HIV care among IDUs.",The AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) Study,9391671,U01DA036297,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Baltimore ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"FANMI: Community Cohort Care for HIV-Infected Adolescent Girls in Haiti Abstract: Sexually active HIV-infected adolescent girls are an extremely vulnerable and underserved population. If treated promptly with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and retained in care, individuals have a near normal life expectancy. Further, ART will decrease vertical and sexual HIV transmission in a population who are sexually active, have high rates of pregnancy and multiple seronegative partners. However, in Haiti and other resource poor countries, HIV-infected adolescents are three times more likely to be lost from care than adults, with only approximately 50% of HIV-infected teens remaining in care at one year. We have developed FANMI (My Family), an innovative model to improve HIV care for adolescent girls. HIV- infected girls age 16-19 years attend monthly HIV care in cohorts of 5-8 peers. All HIV care takes place in a community center rather than in a medical clinic. Each monthly visit integrates clinical care, peer group counseling, and social activities in a single session by the same provider to simplify care and strengthen the relationships between peers and providers. Preliminary data from our pilot study suggest dramatic improvements in retention with 91% of girls remaining in care at one year. Primary Aim: To conduct a randomized controlled trial at the GHESKIO Center in Port au Prince, Haiti. We will randomize 160 HIV-infected girls age 16-19 years (80 per arm) to FANMI versus standard of care with the primary study endpoint being alive and in care at 12 months. We will have >80% power to detect an improvement in retention at 12 months from 60% in the standard group to 85% in FANMI. Secondary Aims: To compare FANMI versus standard care on the following outcomes:  a. Plasma HIV-1 RNA < 1000 copies/µl at 12 months. We predict that 30% of participants in the standard  arm will have a suppressed viral load at 12 months compared to 60% in the FAMNI arm due to improved  retention, increased visit attendance, and improved ART adherence.  b. Sexual risk behavior: self-reported sexual activity, condom use, incidence of sexually-transmitted infections,  and pregnancy rate over 12 months.  c. Acceptability: We will conduct in-depth interviews to evaluate FANMI and factors associated with retention.  d. Health care utilization and costs of FANMI versus standard care. FANMI has the potential to dramatically improve HIV-infected adolescent treatment outcomes across the HIV care cascade and serve as a model of adolescent HIV care in Haiti and other resource-poor countries. NARRATIVE Retention of adolescents in HIV care is essential for prevention of morbidity, mortality, and HIV transmission, but in Haiti, HIV-infected adolescents are three times more likely to be lost from HIV care than adults, with only 50% of HIV-infected teens remaining in care at one year. This study aims to evaluate a model of Cohort Care, in which HIV-infected adolescent girls are seen in the community in cohorts of 5-8 peers integrating clinical care, peer group counseling, and social activities in a single session by the same provider. This innovative model can be adopted in Haiti and other resource-poor settings to improve the survival of HIV-infected adolescents and decrease HIV transmission.",FANMI: Community Cohort Care for HIV-Infected Adolescent Girls in Haiti,9536094,R01HD091935,"['Adolescent Behavior ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Haiti ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Morbidity -

"Identifying and Engaging Urban HIV infected and uninfected YBMSM in care Project Summary The U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy 2020 calls for increasing access to care and improving outcomes of people living with HIV and targeting biomedical prevention efforts (including access to pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) where HIV is most heavily concentrated. Baltimore, MD; Washington, DC; and Philadelphia, PA (BWP) are disproportionately burdened by high rates of new cases of HIV infection, with disproportionate rates in young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) aged 15 to 24. High incidence underscores the need for increased identification, linkage and initiation in HIV and preventive care for YBMSM. Grants focused on high rates directly address NIH research priorities to reduce health disparities in the incidence of HI, in ART outcomes or in high HIV prevalent or high-risk areas. This innovative proposal seeks to test, treat and retain YBMSM living in BWP along the prevention and treatment continuums using the following aims: Aim 1. Identify and recruit young (ages 15-24) black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) in 3 urban cities who are (1) HIV-infected, not virally suppressed; and (2) high-risk HIV uninfected YBMSM, including gender variant and questioning men, using respondent driven sampling with targeted seed identification; Aim 2. Compare the efficacy of two study arms (mobile-enhanced engagement intervention (MEI) vs. standard of care (SOC)) to achieve sustained retention (measured by ≥ 4 follow up visits per 18 months) and engagement in HIV care (measured by durable viral suppression (HIV VL < 200 copies/ml) and substance treatment among 300 HIV infected YBMSM who are not virally suppressed and recruited from RDS; and Aim 3. Modify and implement mobile-enhanced intervention for 300 high-risk HIV uninfected YBMSM, recruited from RDS to promote linkage, retention and engagement of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and substance treatment uptake over 12 months, comparing younger (15-19) and older (20-24) participants. The mobile-enhanced engagement intervention is driven by the expressed and self-determined needs of each HIV infected and uninfected participant and includes care navigation, engagement, treatment and adherence, with a supplemental SBIRT+ intervention, to support YBMSM who face barriers accessing substance use treatment. By building upon existing case management services and flexibility to be adapted across ages and maturity and for prevention services, this intervention has the ability to transform networks, HIV and prevention care in YBMSM in cities with very high primary and secondary HIV transmission. Project Narrative This 3-city proposal seeks to address disparities of HIV in YBMSM in a multilevel intervention to identify, link retain and engage, high-risk uninfected and HIV infected urban YBMSM in prevention and treatment cascade.

"Corrections2Community: Post-release retention in HIV care for ex-inmates in South Africa PROJECT SUMMARY The availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has markedly reduced HIV-related mortality and morbidity in Africa. Yet HIV remains the leading cause of death among adult men and women in South Africa due fails to initiated ART or remain in care. Between 2 and 3% of HIV-infected men in South Africa pass through the corrections system annually. While incarcerated uptake of ART is excellent, unfortunately after release most are lost from care. Qualitative and quantitative research conducted by the research team with 492 ex-inmates in South Africa indicates that upon release from correctional settings, this population encounters confusion regarding where and when to receive care, long queueing times, family abandonment and limited social capital, enacted stigma, economic insecurity, and substance use (injection drug use reported by 11% of our participants). This project seeks to further characterize loss from care following release and to develop and pilot test a group support and HIV care model to retain ex-inmates in HIV care. This support group approach is based on adapting the South African community adherence clubs for a special vulnerable population. Such a care and support group for ex-inmates transitioning in care (a transition community adherence club or TCAC) has the potential to simultaneously address the multiple barriers to medical care through addressing social and care delivery barriers. We hypothesize that intervening on these levels will impact retention in care, virologic suppression, morbidity, and HIV transmission. The current proposal will allow for the development and piloting of this TCAC strategy to improve HIV care for ex-inmates to increase knowledge regarding care engagement for ex-inmates and to prepare for a randomized clinical trial of the TCAC powered for an effectiveness outcome of in-care with an undetectable viral load at 6 months after release. HIV remains the leading cause of death in South Africa as a result of a failure of people living with HIV to seek HIV treatment and be retained in care. After initiating antiretroviral therapy while incarcerated, most ex-inmates fail to remain engaged in care. The goal of this research is to reduce mortality, morbidity, and HIV transmission by developing an actionable approach to retaining these individuals in HIV care.",Corrections2Community: Post-release retention in HIV care for ex-inmates in South Africa,9481618,R34MH115777,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Communities ', ' Confusion ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' South Africa ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' virology ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Process Measure ', ' Caring ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Failure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' social attachment ', ' social bonding ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' correctional system ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' trial comparing ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' traditional care ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' group support ', ' arm ', ' injection drug use ', ' South African ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R34,2018,285048,0.20232332035220982
"An HIV Retention in Care Intervention for Black MSM in Baltimore with a Job Readiness Component Project Summary  Retention in high-quality HIV care is critical for the health of people living with HIV (PLWH) as well as for reducing HIV transmission. One estimate of the HIV Continuum of Care for Black men how have sex with men (BMSM) in the US found that only 24% of BMSM are retained in care (RIC), 20% are on antiretroviral therapy, and 16% are virally suppressed. The structural factors that put men at increased risk for HIV, such as poverty, unemployment, and incarceration, also act as barriers to HIV care. The proposed project will develop and pilot test a retention in HIV care intervention for BMSM living in Baltimore that incorporates a job readiness component: Aim 1: Formative research for intervention development in practice settings One-to-one interviews with BMSM living with HIV will explore factors that facilitate engagement in care, unmet needs, and job readiness. Focus group discussions with key stakeholders will explore barriers and facilitators to implementing RIC interventions and the integration of job readiness into RIC programs. Aim 2: Develop and component test a RIC curriculum for BMSM with a job readiness component that is guided by Self-Determination Theory and an implementation science framework. Aim 3: Conduct a pilot RCT to assess feasibility and preliminary outcomes. A RCT with 50 BMSM living with HIV who are not virally suppressed will use mixed methods to assess acceptability, implementation, and limited efficacy. The primary outcome of interest will be viral suppression.  The proposed behavioral-medical intervention will be guided by Self-Determination Theory. In addition, the intervention will be developed using an implementation science framework, the Damschroer's Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, in order to promote sustainability and dissemination. This research reduces disparities in treatment outcomes in a severely underserved population of PLWH and will provide rigorous training and study in implementation science. This work is novel in that it: focuses on an underserved population, incorporates job readiness into HIV retention in care, and is guided by Self- Determination Theory. This research career development award will provide training to the recipient in the following three areas: implementation science, intervention development, and experimental design. This training will allow the recipient to achieve her career goal of conducting independent research to develop, test, and study the implementation of HIV prevention programs for underserved populations. Project Narrative Retention in HIV care is important for the health of people living with HIV as well as for reduction of HIV transmissions. Black men who have sex with men are one of the populations most disproportionately burdened by HIV. This project will develop a HIV retention in care program for BMSM that includes a job readiness component and provide training to the recipient in implementation science, intervention development, and experimental design.",An HIV Retention in Care Intervention for Black MSM in Baltimore with a Job Readiness Component,9481337,K01MH111388,"['Baltimore ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Counseling ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Program Development ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Self Determination ', ' Social Marketing ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Testing ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Case Management ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Medical ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Training ', ' Employment Status ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' outreach ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' implementation research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' implementation science ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' workplace readiness ', ' workforce readiness ', ' work readiness ', ' job readiness ', ' career readiness ', ' career preparation ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' translational researcher ', ' translational investigator ', ' translational scientist ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' practice setting ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,153086,0.1342018139062915
"Improving engagement in HIV care for high-risk women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender women (assigned `male' at birth but who do not identify as male) are disproportionately impacted by HIV and have culturally unique barriers and facilitators to engagement in HIV care. Transgender women living with HIV (TWH) are less likely than others to take antiretroviral therapy (ART), and those who initiate ART have lower rates of ART adherence, lower self-efficacy for integrating ART into daily routines, and report fewer positive interactions with health care providers than non-transgender adults. As a result, TWH have an almost three-fold higher viral load than non-transgender adults in San Francisco; in Los Angeles, TWH are less likely to be virally suppressed than any other behavioral risk group. In our formative work, we have identified culturally-specific and modifiable barriers to HIV treatment engagement among TWH, including prioritization of transition-related health care (i.e. hormone therapy) at the expense of HIV treatment, avoidance of HIV care settings due to past negative health care experiences, misinformation about ART including potential drug interactions with hormones, intensified HIV stigma, low levels of social support, and poor coping skills. There are both individual and public health consequences to poor engagement in care among TWH stemming from high transmission risk factors, including substance abuse, high numbers of sex partners, engagement in sex work, and high rates of mental illness. These findings strongly suggest that TWH face unique challenges to engaging in and adhering to HIV treatment, and that the public health consequences for poor engagement in this population are of grave concern. Interventions to mitigate these barriers to engagement in care are critical in efforts to alter the pattern of HIV-related disparities that lead to disproportionately poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable and marginalized population. We propose a randomized controlled trial of a theory- driven, population-specific, piloted intervention to improve engagement in care for TWH. Grounded in the investigators' Models of Gender Affirmation and Health Care Empowerment, the proposed research is the first to systematically intervene on complex barriers to optimal engagement in HIV care for TWH. We have developed and piloted the Healthy Divas intervention to optimize engagement in HIV care for TWH at elevated risk for treatment failure and consequential morbidity, mortality, and transmission of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed trial is grounded in a novel transgender-specific framework and is the culmination of years of work in a community at heightened risk for HIV treatment failure and transmission of HIV to others. If effective, the proposed intervention approach has the potential to optimize health outcomes in a population highly burdened by HIV while preventing further transmission.",Improving engagement in HIV care for high-risk women,9548735,R01MH106373,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Appointment ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Critical Care ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Los Angeles ', ' male ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Silicones ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' virology ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Misinformation ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Shelter facility ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' uptake ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' health care model ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Viral load measurement ', ' virus load ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' trial comparing ', ' stem ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' primary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' intervention effect ', ' follow up assessment ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender women ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' Injections ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,781066,0.1988959647999412
"Multi-level Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health and Missed HIV Healthcare Provider Visits Project Summary/Abstract  Despite the benefits of engagement in HIV care, a substantial number of black people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are poorly retained in care in the United States. An individual's race cannot fully explain these observed disparities in retention in HIV care. Social and behavioral determinants of health including an individual's actions, social/physical environment, and access to health services are also modifiable contributors. However, studies on the combined impact of individual-, community-, infrastructure/health system-, and structural-level social and behavioral determinants of health on retention in HIV care, with specific attention to race, are lacking. The aims of this study are: 1) To develop and validate a predictive model which will include race as well as social and behavioral determinants of heath from multiple levels (individual-, community-, infrastructure/health system-, and structural-level) and; 2) To identify modifiable individual-level patient-reported outcomes (i.e. mental health, alcohol and substance use, quality of life, symptom burden) which partially or fully mediate the relationship between black race and missed visits, after accounting for less easily modifiable, community-and structural-level confounders. These results will inform the design of an intervention package aimed to reduce missed HIV healthcare provider visits for black patients, a population disproportionately affected by poor HIV health-related outcomes. Additionally, they will provide a predictive model that will allow point-of-care ascertainment of risk of missing visits in order to target this intervention package toward black patients most likely to benefit.  This research team is uniquely positioned to complete the work proposed in this application. The principal investigator, Dr. Pettit has significant experience in conducting epidemiologic studies of HIV outcomes in large multi-cohort collaborations. Dr. Mugavero, a co-investigator on this proposal, brings content expertise in retention in HIV care and experience conducting studies of HIV outcomes within the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Drs. Shepherd, Rebeiro, and Turan, also co-investigators on this proposal, bring complimentary skills in biostatistics and epidemiology as well as behavioral science and psychometrics required to carry out the analytic plan. Other resources available to the research team include Vanderbilt's Clinical and Translational Science Award, the Tennessee and University of Alabama Centers for AIDS Research, and the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) Core services.  The proposed studies will provide important insights into the contribution of factors from multiple levels on missed HIV healthcare provider visits among black PLWHA in the United States. Moreover, these findings will inform the design and evaluation of a future intervention or support package aimed at modifiable social and behavioral determinants of health in order to improve health outcomes and reduce racial disparities for HIV- infected persons. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance Social and behavioral determinants of health are known to contribute to poorer retention in HIV care and increased HIV-related mortality among black patients in the United States. Our understanding of these determinants from multiple levels (individual, community, infrastructure/health system, and structural levels) and their influence on racial disparities in missing HIV healthcare provider visits is incomplete. Further characterization of the association of social and behavioral determinants of health from multiple levels with retention in HIV care among blacks is critical for the development and evaluation of intervention support packages aimed to decrease the number of missed clinic visits and mortality in this population.",Multi-level Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health and Missed HIV Healthcare Provider Visits,9694085,R01MH113438,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Attention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Black race ', ' Budgets ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Criminal Law ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Tennessee ', ' Triage ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Viremia ', ' virusemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' viraemia ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Health Care Visit ', ' Healthcare Visit ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' Behavioral ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,98620,0.15681953362650117
"Risk and Resiliency among Vulnerable PLWHIV in Post-Hurricane Puerto Rico ABSTRACT In September 2017, the Caribbean region and southern United States was hit by four hurricanes (Irma, Harvey, Maria, and Nate), resulting in widespread and severe damage to infrastructure and ongoing disruption of social and economic systems throughout the region, including Puerto Rico. While the immediate and ongoing impact on public health has yet to be fully assessed, it may be expected that the it may also have serious consequences for a wide range of health outcomes, exacerbating pre-hurricane health disparities and placing even greater pressure on an already under-resourced health services infrastructure. Of particular concern in this application is the impact of the 2017 hurricanes on the large population of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) in Puerto Rico, including substantial proportions of vulnerable groups of women, men who have sex with men, and injection drug users. HIV testing rates among high-risk populations in PR have remained low throughout the HIV epidemic, as is engagement in HIV care, both of which contribute to increased secondary transmission. Late detection has inevitably contributed to late enrollment in care. Most PLWHIV in PR enter care with already serious compromised immune response, making them more vulnerable to HIV-related opportunistic infections and associated morbidity. Indeed PR has one of the highest HIV death rates in the US (roughly four times higher than the national average). Prior research on natural disasters of a similar in severity and scope, such as Hurricane Katrina, for example, showed that there was a significant impact on mental health (e.g., stress, trauma, etc.) and that combined external factors related to the accessibility of HIV care, resulted in significant changes in clinical HIV status. Positioned as a preliminary, R21 level initiative, we propose an exploratory study to assess whether there have been significant post-hurricane changes in clinical HIV status among PLWHIV in PR, and if so, what factors predict those changes. This application builds upon a well-established collaboration between HIV researchers in the School of Public Health at the University of Puerto Rico and Centro Latinoamericano de Enfermedades de Transmisión Sexual (CLETS), the largest HIV treatment center in PR. The ongoing CORE study within the CLETS clinic population provides a strategic opportunity to examine the impact of the 2017 hurricanes on clinical outcomes among PLWHIV in PR. We will adapt the CORE survey instruments to capture additional data related to post-hurricane behavioral risks, mental health status, and help-seeking and recover both pre-hurricane and post-hurricane clinical data for each study participant using a Targeted Chart Review process. We will examine the clinical data for three months prior to the hurricane and compare it with post-hurricane clinical data to assess whether there have been significant post-hurricane changes in HIV clinical status (CD4, viral load, OIs, etc.) among the PLWHIV, using data from the CORE survey to identify predictors of those changes. For example, post-hurricane gaps in the availability of HIV care, increased mental health distress (e.g., PTSD, anxiety, depression), and increased behavioral risk (notably in substance use) may individually and collectively have contributed to gaps in adherence. Failure to maintain viral suppression may have negative consequences for the health status of individual PLWHIV and may also amplify secondary transmission. The proposed study may inform ongoing efforts to restore critical health services for PLWHIV and inform future research in this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE In September 2017, the Caribbean region and southern U.S. was hit by four hurricanes (Irma, Harvey, Maria, and Nate), significantly impacting island populations in the region, including Puerto Rico. The proposed study will assess the impact of the ongoing natural disaster on increased risk for poor health outcomes among vulnerable populations living with HIV in Puerto Rico.",Risk and Resiliency among Vulnerable PLWHIV in Post-Hurricane Puerto Rico,9685291,R21MD013657,"['Anxiety ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Hurricane ', ' Incidence ', ' Island ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' United States Virgin Islands ', ' Virgin Islands ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Caring ', ' Opportunistic Infection AIDS ', ' HIV-Related Opportunistic Infections ', ' AIDS Associated Opportunistic Infection ', ' AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Failure ', ' Distress ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' PWID ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Services ', ' Participant ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Population Group ', ' Geographic state ', ' US State ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' treatment center ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' gulf coast ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' treatment adherence ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' service providers ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,R21,2018,225000,0.051382179185663686
"Youth Services Navigation Intervention for HIV+ adolescents and young adults being released from incarceration: A randomized control trial Project Summary/Abstract The continuum of HIV care has forced new focus on the urgency to identify and effectively serve high-need, under-resourced, and often transient populations to facilitate their receiving the necessary ongoing care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress HIV RNA viral load (VL). Crucial target groups for improving care along the continuum are young (aged 16-25), sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations being released from jail settings. HIV prevalence among incarcerated youth living with HIV (YLWH) is three times that of the general population and one in seven of all HIV+ persons experience incarceration each year. HIV incidence, prevalence, and incarceration rates are higher for blacks and Latinos than for any other group – these disparities are especially prominent among youth. Furthermore, only an estimated 6% of HIV+ youth are virally suppressed, due to poor retention and adherence to ART. Existing linkage and retention services are insufficient to meet the acute needs of criminal justice-involved (CJI) HIV+ youth, particularly in the high-need period following release from incarceration. Moreover, because of their lack of experience, many youths may struggle to obtain needed services and stabilize their living conditions. Disparities in HIV continuum outcomes are inextricably linked to incarceration, substance use disorders (SUDs), homelessness, and mental health (MH) problems among YLWH. If HIV is to be controlled and the benefits of ART experienced broadly, the problems of CJI YLWH must be addressed with innovative, youth-, and sexual and gender minority (SGM)- sensitive approaches. We propose to enroll 240 CJI YLWH, aged 16-25, incarcerated in Los Angeles and Chicago jails and juvenile detention facilities. We will randomize participants to the YSN intervention (n=120) vs. a usual-care control group (n=120). The youth services navigators (YSNs) will assist with addressing immediate unmet needs such as housing, transportation, and food prior to clinical care and ongoing; will guide intervention participants to a range of community services to support progress along the continuum of HIV care; and will provide direct ART adherence support. The proposed study has two Primary Specific Aims: 1. Adapt an existing peer navigation intervention for adults to create a Youth Service Navigation (YSN) intervention sensitive to SGM culture that guides youth to needed services along the continuum of HIV care. This intervention combines medical, substance use and mental health care with comprehensive reentry support for CJI YLWH, aged 16-25 upon release from large county jails and juvenile detention systems; 2. Using a two-group RCT design, we will test the effectiveness of the new YSN, youth SGM-sensitive intervention among CJI YLWH aged 16-25, compared to controls offered standard referrals to services. We will evaluate the YSN Intervention's effect on post-incarceration linkage, retention, adherence, and viral suppression, as well as on SUDs, mental health, services utilization, and met needs. Secondary Aims: We will assess YSN's effects on recidivism, costs and potential cost-offset/effectiveness.   Public Health Relevance Crucial target groups for improving care along the Continuum of Care are young (aged 16-25) HIV+ sexual and gender minority youths with criminal-justice involvement (CJI) – a population that is poorly retained in HIV care. If HIV is to be controlled and the benefits of ART advances experienced broadly, the problems of CJI young people living with HIV must be addressed with innovative, youth-, and sexual and gender minority-sensitive approaches. The proposed Youth Services Navigation intervention will address this gap, testing a youth- focused approach that is adapted from our successful intervention with HIV+ CJI adults.",Youth Services Navigation Intervention for HIV+ adolescents and young adults being released from incarceration: A randomized control trial,9540937,R01MD011773,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Chicago ', ' Community Health Services ', ' Community Services ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Housing ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Los Angeles ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Persons ', ' Probability ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' viral RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' Shelter facility ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Gays ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' recidivism ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' contingency management ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' community re-entry ', ' community reentry ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' successful intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender women ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' trial design ', ' navigator intervention ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' usual care control group ', ' usual care arm ', ' intervention participants ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,719944,0.09846469205675178
"A Mobile Health Application for Engagement in Care among Youth Living with HIV Abstract/Project Summary:  In the US, fewer than 6% of all youth living with HIV (YLWH) achieve HIV viral suppression. This health disparity extends to the entire HIV care continuum in that there is a strong association between younger age and later HIV diagnosis, lower engagement in care, lower levels of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, and worse HIV clinical outcomes. In response to this critical public health dilemma and aligned with the National Institute of Health's High Priority Topics of Research (i.e., “to reduce health disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections or in treatment outcomes of those living with HIV/AIDS”), our research team proposes to develop a novel mobile health application (“app”) to improve engagement in health care and ART adherence and to pilot test this mobile health app in 18-29 year-old YLWH. The aims of our study are to: Aim 1: Build on our theory-guided model and formative work to complete the development of our novel personalized mobile health app, WYZ (pronounced “wise”), for improved HIV clinical outcomes among YLWH. Our research team will work with the University of California, San Francisco's Information Services Unit to complete the development of WYZ using an iterative Human-Centered Design approach. This will be done by adding data integration with pharmacy and laboratory databases, creation of an Android-compatible version of the app based on our in-progress iOS version, refinement based on user-experience data from field testing, and qualitative interviews with the primary care providers of the youth participating in the field testing. Aim 2: Conduct a pilot randomized trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical impact (i.e., adherence, plasma HIV RNA, and CD4+ cell count) of the use of WYZ among YLWH and their HCPs. Aim 2 consists of two sub-aims: 2a. Examine feasibility and acceptability of the use of WYZ based on defined metrics, acceptability through qualitative exit interviews, and preliminary clinical impact by virologic/immunologic outcomes with participants randomized to the intervention versus the wait-list control. 2b. Assess the acceptability of WYZ by participants' HCPs through individual qualitative interviews.  We hypothesize that our mobile health app will be feasible and acceptable and will result in improved HIV clinical outcomes. Our study is significant because it has the potential to improve engagement in care, ART adherence, and clinical outcomes among YLWH. Our study is innovative because we will employ a novel suite of technology-based methods to improve information, motivation, and behavioral skills in YLWH. Upon completion, we will be ready to test the efficacy of this app in a subsequent large-scale RCT among this population that is disproportionately impacted by HIV and at elevated risk for poor clinical outcomes. Narrative: The research in this R34 proposal is relevant because: (1) it will complete the development of our novel personalized mobile health app for improved HIV clinical outcomes among youth living with HIV; (2) it will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical impact of the use of this app among youth living with HIV in a 12-month pilot randomized trial; and (3) it will examine the acceptability of this app by participants' healthcare providers.",A Mobile Health Application for Engagement in Care among Youth Living with HIV,9545089,R34MH114604,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Services ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' San Francisco ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' virology ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Adolescent Trials Network ', ' Adolescent Medicine Trials Network ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' health information technology ', ' population health ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' tailored healthcare ', ' tailored health care ', ' Android ', ' mHealth app ', ' Mobile Health App ', ' Mobile Health Application ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R34,2018,237750,0.08180582925160193
"Addressing Barriers to Retention in HIV Care for Hispanic Immigrants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient engagement in HIV care encompasses a cascade of events from HIV diagnosis to retention in care. Each step is vital in achieving the goal of virologic suppression and improved health outcomes. Compromising this clinical imperative is the nearly 50% of HIV-infected individuals in the US who are not in continuous HIV care. The HIV epidemic poses a particularly severe problem in Hispanic populations. While Hispanics comprise 16% of the US population, they comprise 20% of new HIV infections. Immigrants make up 42% of new HIV diagnoses in Hispanics. Emerging interventions to improve retention in HIV care in the general HIV-infected population have not been adequately studied in Hispanic immigrants, a growing segment of the population where risk for poor outcomes is a precarious reality. Factors specific both to Hispanic cultures and to immigrant status are essential to highlight for effective intervention development. A better understanding of these factors could lead to improved, tailored approaches to retention in HIV care for Hispanic immigrants, improvement in health outcomes, and a reduction in ongoing HIV transmission. CANDIDATE: My specialized training in clinical infectious disease, public health, and Hispanic studies, coupled with extensive resources at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), uniquely position me to accomplish these aims. I have five peer-reviewed research articles directly related to HIV outcomes and the consequences of adherence to care in resource-limited settings, and extensive clinical experience caring for HIV-infected individuals as well as immigrants. RESEARCH: I will conduct formative qualitative research with Hispanic immigrants infected with HIV and their medical providers to understand factors (e.g. individual preferences, structural barriers) and agents (e.g. role of the family) that influence decision-making around retention in primary HIV care. I will give specific attention to generating novel intervention ideas to improve retention in HIV care through these in-depth interviews with patients and the multi-disciplinary providers within an HIV provider team including physicians, nurses, social workers, case managers, and community health workers (Aim 1). I will expand the Andersen Model of Health Services Use to include conceptual models of health disparities in order to evaluate societal, clinic/system- level, and individual determinants of HIV care utilization. Guided by this conceptual model, formative research, and community stakeholder feedback, we will identify the most significant and modifiable factors that determine retention in HIV care for the study population in order to inform the development of an intervention. We will develop and pilot test a culturally-tailored intervention (Aim 2). The intervention will target Hispanic immigrants who are not retained in HIV care, and for whom there are limited culturally relevant interventions. We will intervene at a particularly vulnerable period in the HIV care cascade, retention in care, where care interruption poses substantial consequences for both the individual, due to risk of clinical decline and risk-taking behaviors, and for public health, due threat of resulting HIV transmission. Standardization of the intervention will occur through iterative refinements based on participant and community advisory board feedback. Through a focused randomized pilot trial (Aim 3), we will further refine study procedures and perform preliminary power analyses in preparation for a larger, more definitive test of the intervention directed through submission of an R01 proposal at the end of the award. TRAINING/MENTORING: My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing culturally-tailored community-based interventions to improve outcomes in HIV and other chronic diseases for vulnerable populations. I will need rigorous training in methodologies that will enable me to fully capture factors, such as culture and context, and processes, such as acculturation, that influence use of HIV care for Hispanic immigrants. Training in community-engaged methods will facilitate effective development and deployment of novel interventions in the community setting. To complement my prior training in clinical care and HIV outcomes research, I have outlined a plan for intensive training in community-based participatory research, qualitative research, behavioral theory, and intervention development. This training will occur through graduate-level coursework as well as through intensive supervision with my mentors, who are internationally- recognized leaders in areas of research directly related to the proposal. My mentorship team also has a strong foothold in community-based partnerships for research and HIV care delivery in Massachusetts and nationally. Furthermore, this project advances the institutional strategic priorities of the CDC, NIMH and the Office of AIDS Research, notably, to reduce HIV health disparities and to improve medical care for people living with HIV. The successful completion of this research will position me as an expert in retention in care for HIV-infected Hispanic immigrants, and more generally will enable me to address challenges in vulnerable populations burdened with chronic illnesses that require innovative models for disease management. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of the 1.2 million HIV-infected individuals in the US, nearly 50% are not engaged in regular HIV care and 80% do not show viral load suppression, a marker of HIV treatment success. Among Hispanic patients with HIV, immigrants represent 40% of new HIV cases, an important public health disparity that reflects a confluence of ill-defined risks and barriers to health care. This Career Development Award will address the knowledge gap in barriers to retention in HIV care for Hispanic immigrants, and will leverage this information to develop and pilot test culturally-relevant approaches to improve retention in care, a critical yet underdeveloped area of public health research.",Addressing Barriers to Retention in HIV Care for Hispanic

"Technology Based Community Health Nursing to Improve cART Adherence and Virologic Suppression in Youth Living with HIV (TechN 2 CheckIN): A Regional Multi-site Study Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has disproportionately persisted as a public health threat to adolescents and young adults (AYA) from minority communities in the United States. HIV has evolved into a chronic disease, which can be managed in the outpatient setting with antiretroviral therapy (ART) designed to achieve virologic suppression and life expectancy equivalent for uninfected individuals. However, for AYA, huge disparities exist compared to adults, with greater proportions unaware of their status, lower rates of care engagement, retention, and initiation and maintenance of ART, resulting in higher rates of virologic non- suppression, and development of sequelae including immunologic deterioration and transmission. Interventions designed to improve outcomes for youth living with HIV (YLHIV) are being sponsored by agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, however, most target the early components of the continuum of care (identification, linkage, and ART initiation). Our research from the HIV Research Network shows that 30-40% of YLHIV are not virologically suppressed despite being in care, highlighting the need for novel interventions targeting the distal components of the care continuum. Community health nurse (CHN) interventions have been shown to increase access to appropriate resources, enhance health care utilization, and promote risk-reducing behavior among AYA. Use of short messaging service (SMS) messaging can further enhance clinical care by improving attendance at medical visits, medication adherence, and communication with the health care team. We have used these two modalities in randomized trials of youth with complex sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in low-income minority communities with high feasibility and acceptability amongst AYA and their families, remarkable improvements in visit completion, medication adherence, and reduction in recurrent STIs. The overarching goal of this project is to build on the evidence from this trial and to repurpose the intervention for YLHIV in the same community who are having challenges with care and medication non-adherence. We aim to compare the effectiveness of a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention (TECH-N 2 CHECK-IN) to a standard of care control group using a randomized trial design. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will result in higher rates of adherence to ART and virologic suppression. We have demonstrated our interdisciplinary team's capacity to follow urban AYA in the community, utilizing the combination of CHNs and outreach workers to optimize care according to national standards. TECH-IN 2 CHECK-IN aims to enroll 120 YLHIV followed at clinics specializing in HIV care in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan area who are challenged with treatment adherence and randomizing them to receive TECH-IN 2 CHECK-IN vs. standard of care. Results of this trial will inform best practices for engaging YLHIV by addressing the distal component of the continuum, critical to achieving the elusive 90-90-90 HIV goals.  Project Relevance Despite advances in HIV treatment, youth living with HIV (YLHIV) have profound challenges with adherence to care visits and antiretroviral therapy (ART), with 1/3 of YLHIV who are in care not reaching virologic suppression; however, few evidence-based interventions have been developed or studied that can improve these rates. We will repurpose a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention (TECH-N) with demonstrated efficacy for improving care adherence and reducing risk behaviors among youth from similar racial/ethnic, socioeconomic status and community backgrounds into an HIV-focused intervention (TECH-N 2 CHECK-IN) and use a randomized controlled trial design to compare it to standard of care for YLHIV who are non-adherent to care and ART using data on medication adherence, virologic suppression, and cost- effectiveness. If successful, this study will provide critical data to support the need for comprehensive, higher intensity community-based nursing services that leverage mHealth to assist the subset of the mostly racial/ethnic minority YLHIV who are challenged by the complexity of HIV care and to introduce a novel strategy to move the United States closer to meeting our 2020 National Health Objectives by

"Improving Health Outcomes for Women Living with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Globally, transgender (`trans') women have 49 times higher odds of HIV infection compared to other groups and trans women living with HIV (TWH) access HIV care and adhere to medication at significantly lower rates than other at-risk groups. Poor engagement in HIV care for TWH is a result of reduced access to and avoidance of healthcare due to stigma and negative experiences with providers, and occurs in the context of social and economic marginalization that foments unstable employment and housing, familial alienation, limited social support, and substance abuse. Interventions to mitigate these barriers to care are critical to reducing HIV-related disparities and poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable population, particularly where disparities are most apparent, including Brazil. Peer-based navigation (PN) interventions have demonstrated success in improving engagement in HIV care in low-resource settings. Our research group is currently conducting a PN intervention (`I-Care') in rural South Africa that significantly improved both linkage to care and retention for men and women. While the PN intervention addresses HIV care engagement by providing social support and skills to work with health providers and family, it requires specific adaptation and a conceptual model that addresses the unique needs of TWH identified during formative research and in consultations with Brazilian stakeholders in 2015. We propose to develop and conduct a trans-specific PN intervention in Brazil, tentatively named `TransAmigas', which integrates the I-Care approach with the Model of Gender Affirmation (GA), developed by our research team to specifically address HIV prevention and care among trans women. We will use the ADAPT-ITT methodology to develop TransAmigas, incorporating the GA model in the Brazilian context (Aim 1). We will then conduct a pilot study to test the feasibility and acceptability of TransAmigas in São Paulo, Brazil (Aim 2) by randomizing TWH to the intervention (n=100) or to clinical referral (n=50). During the nine month pilot, we will track both navigator and patient adherence to the program, recruitment needs, cohort retention, and reported satisfaction and preferences for program content through surveys at baseline and nine months. Finally, we will prepare for a multi-site efficacy trial (Aim 3) by extracting clinical data from participants' records at the referral clinic, generating preliminary efficacy data by comparing retention in HIV care and viral load by intervention arm. Clinical data will inform future trial sample size. We will implement this study in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where universal access to care and public support for gender transition care provide an enabling environment for this work to be most effective and where the team has established academic partnerships and a collaboration with the State-run reference and training clinical site (CRT), which includes trans-specific clinical services. If feasible, acceptable, and ultimately proven efficacious, TransAmigas will be the first evidence-based HIV care intervention for TWH globally – filling a crucial gap in programming. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peer Navigation (PN) that is integrated with gender affirming programming for transgender women living with HIV (TWH) could significantly improve HIV care engagement and health outcomes in this population that suffers a disproportionate burden of HIV. This study, which will be implemented in São Paulo, Brazil, aims to integrate a successful PN model with the trans-specific Model of Gender Affirmation and then pilot the intervention using a randomized design. We will determine the acceptability and feasibility of this intervention for improving health outcomes among TWH, and glean needed information to prepare for a multi-site trial. There are currently no interventions proven to increase retention in HIV care and reduce viral load for TWH; as a result, this work will fill a large gap in evidence-based continuum of care

"Development of a Couple-Based Mobile Health Intervention for Enhancing HIV Care Engagement Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to other racial/ethnic groups in the US, Black men who have sex with men (MSM), once diagnosed, are less likely to be optimally engaged in HIV care and treatment. This undermines the promise of recent prevention approaches for reducing the disproportionate effects of HIV/AIDS on Black communities, emphasizing the urgency for increased research focus and intervention development. Understanding HIV care engagement in the context of the dyad may be part of a comprehensive effort to addressing multilevel influences on HIV care engagement outcomes that are unique to HIV+ Black MSM towards achieving the maximum public health benefit of treatment-as-prevention. However, the scarcity of dyad-level research limits our understanding of couple dynamics involved in HIV care engagement to inform intervention development targeting the couple, underscoring the need for couple-based studies of relational dynamics important to the HIV care engagement of the HIV+ partner(s). Mobile technology-based strategies (mHealth) offer tremendous potential as an acceptable, feasible, and effective intervention platform for enhancing HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black MSM in couples by facilitating couple dynamics optimal to HIV care engagement. Further, mHealth offers potential in addressing limitations in previous intervention research with couples, one of which is the dissipation of intervention effects over time due to absence of booster sessions. Therefore, the aims of the study are to: elucidate the effects of couple dynamics on HIV care engagement among partnered synthesize the quantitative and qualitative (mixed methods) outcomes from Aim 1 to identify the issues the intervention will target, and to iteratively determine core components of a couple-based intervention for HIV+ Black MSM (Aim 2); and develop a novel, technology-based intervention prototype for enhancing HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black MSM in couples (Aim 3). HIV+ Black MSM (Aim 1); The overall objective of this application is to achieve a better understanding of the couple dynamics involved in HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black men in same-sex relationships. The end goal is the development of an mHealth tool that targets couple dynamics important to enhancing HIV care engagement. Through these aims, I will acquire additional training necessary for my career development in (a) theory and mixed methods for conducting couple-based research, (b) formative research in intervention development, and (c) prototype design. These research and career development activities will build the foundation to my becoming an independent, NIH-funded investigator with skills to conduct couple-based intervention research that is part of a comprehensive effort in HIV prevention integrating advances in technology and behavioral medicine to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV/AIDS among Black men is a US public health crisis, emphasizing the urgency for increased research focus and intervention development. The overall objective of this application is to achieve a better understanding of the couple dynamics involved in HIV care engagement among partnered HIV+ Black men.

"Delivering High-Quality HIV Care in the South: System-Level Policy Alternatives PROJECT SUMMARY While clinical care for HIV has made tremendous advances, the majority of persons living with HIV in the US do not receive the evidence-based care that will allow them to fully extend life and improve health. Lack of effective HIV care is particularly problematic in the Southern region, the epicenter of the US HIV epidemic and where poverty, uninsurance, rurality, and a constrained health workforce further threaten effective care. Research suggests that system-level factors, or the structural and policy-related aspects of health care delivery, have the potential to improve quality of care and health outcomes. But little is known about their role in the context of HIV care delivery, quality of care, and health outcomes. The proposed research will study how two modifiable system-level factors—geographic accessibility to care and physician payment policies—affect quality of HIV care and population outcomes, including new HIV infections, along the HIV care continuum in the US South. Because racial and ethnic minorities face increased barriers to HIV care, we pay special attention to how these system-level factors may contribute to disparities in quality of HIV care and population outcomes along the HIV care continuum. The research involves developing a novel database that combines multiple data sources, including Medicaid administrative claims files, HIV surveillance data, and county and state characteristics from national datasets. Our approach will rely on state-of-the-art spatial network analysis and data visualization (mapping), statistical tests using econometric methods, and systems science forecasting techniques that have been used to study quality of care and population health outcomes. The work moves beyond examination of core quality of HIV care measures to include HIV-related preventive care measures that collectively are critical to reducing HIV morbidity and mortality. In investigating these factors, the study will answer a number of important questions. How do geographic accessibility, measured in travel time to receive care, and physician payment for services affect quality of HIV care in the South? Are these effects different among racial and ethnic minorities? Do improvements in geographic accessibility or increased physician payments reduce new HIV infections and racial and ethnic disparities along the HIV care continuum? The proposed study will address these questions and others. By quantifying the role of system-level factors in quality of HIV care and population health along the HIV care continuum, as well as understanding disparities in these effects, the research will provide valuable information to state and federal policy makers who seek to address systemic challenges to effective HIV care, efficiently allocate scarce resources, and improve public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Improving geographic access to care (measured in travel time to receive care) and assuring adequate physician payments for services are potential pathways to improve care for HIV patients in the Southern states, the center of the US HIV epidemic. This project investigates the effects of these pathways on quality of HIV care and on population health, including new HIV infections, and the differences in these effects across populations--particularly racial and ethnic minorities who face increased barriers to HIV care. This study will guide future federal and state policy regarding the geographic placement of HIV services and payments for physicians, which will lead to improved health for HIV patients in the US South.",Delivering High-Quality HIV Care in the South: System-Level Policy Alternatives,9470812,R01MD011277,"['Affect ', ' Appointment ', ' Attention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Incentives ', ' Lipids ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' influenza virus vaccination ', ' flu immunisation ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' federal policy ', ' population health ', ' surveillance data ', ' data visualization ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' rurality ', ' ']",NIMHD,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,375894,0.23241742546215244
"Multi-level Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health and Missed HIV Healthcare Provider Visits Project Summary/Abstract  Despite the benefits of engagement in HIV care, a substantial number of black people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are poorly retained in care in the United States. An individual's race cannot fully explain these observed disparities in retention in HIV care. Social and behavioral determinants of health including an individual's actions, social/physical environment, and access to health services are also modifiable contributors. However, studies on the combined impact of individual-, community-, infrastructure/health system-, and structural-level social and behavioral determinants of health on retention in HIV care, with specific attention to race, are lacking. The aims of this study are: 1) To develop and validate a predictive model which will include race as well as social and behavioral determinants of heath from multiple levels (individual-, community-, infrastructure/health system-, and structural-level) and; 2) To identify modifiable individual-level patient-reported outcomes (i.e. mental health, alcohol and substance use, quality of life, symptom burden) which partially or fully mediate the relationship between black race and missed visits, after accounting for less easily modifiable, community-and structural-level confounders. These results will inform the design of an intervention package aimed to reduce missed HIV healthcare provider visits for black patients, a population disproportionately affected by poor HIV health-related outcomes. Additionally, they will provide a predictive model that will allow point-of-care ascertainment of risk of missing visits in order to target this intervention package toward black patients most likely to benefit.  This research team is uniquely positioned to complete the work proposed in this application. The principal investigator, Dr. Pettit has significant experience in conducting epidemiologic studies of HIV outcomes in large multi-cohort collaborations. Dr. Mugavero, a co-investigator on this proposal, brings content expertise in retention in HIV care and experience conducting studies of HIV outcomes within the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Drs. Shepherd, Rebeiro, and Turan, also co-investigators on this proposal, bring complimentary skills in biostatistics and epidemiology as well as behavioral science and psychometrics required to carry out the analytic plan. Other resources available to the research team include Vanderbilt's Clinical and Translational Science Award, the Tennessee and University of Alabama Centers for AIDS Research, and the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) Core services.  The proposed studies will provide important insights into the contribution of factors from multiple levels on missed HIV healthcare provider visits among black PLWHA in the United States. Moreover, these findings will inform the design and evaluation of a future intervention or support package aimed at modifiable social and behavioral determinants of health in order to improve health outcomes and reduce racial disparities for HIV- infected persons. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance Social and behavioral determinants of health are known to contribute to poorer retention in HIV care and increased HIV-related mortality among black patients in the United States. Our understanding of these determinants from multiple levels (individual, community, infrastructure/health system, and structural levels) and their influence on racial disparities in missing HIV healthcare provider visits is incomplete. Further characterization of the association of social and behavioral determinants of health from multiple levels with retention in HIV care among blacks is critical for the development and evaluation of intervention support packages aimed to decrease the number of missed clinic visits and mortality in this population.",Multi-level Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health and Missed HIV Healthcare Provider Visits,9480177,R01MH113438,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Attention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Black race ', ' Budgets ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Criminal Law ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Tennessee ', ' Triage ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Viremia ', ' virusemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' viraemia ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Health Care Visit ', ' Healthcare Visit ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' Behavioral ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,406972,0.15681953362650117

among Black people who inject drugs, and identifying potential healthcare “resilience factors” that offset  negative impacts of exposures to hazardous neighborhood features, including those less malleable to change.  We will combine data from the longest-­running cohort of HIV-­infected Black people who have histories of  injecting drugs in Baltimore, Maryland (The AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience Study) in follow-­up for  two decades (1997-­2017) with administrative data on neighborhood-­level features, and will utilize rigorous  marginal structural modeling to accomplish the following aims: Aims 1 and 2: Assess longitudinal impacts of  exposure to neighborhood features (e.g., neighborhood drug market activity, spatial access to drug treatment  and syringe exchange programs, housing affordability, gentrification, etc.) measured at a single point in time  and cumulatively on lapses in HIV care and virologic failure among HIV-­infected Black people who inject drugs  in Baltimore, Maryland. Sub-­Aims 1 and 2: Explore whether healthcare factors (e.g., consistent and trustworthy  HIV care provider) modify the impact of “point-­in-­time” and cumulative exposures to neighborhood features on  subsequent lapses in HIV care and virologic failure among HIV-­infected Black people who inject drugs in  Baltimore, Maryland. The proposed study will advance national priorities by informing the development of an  intervention that connects HIV-­infected people who inject drugs to community-­based programs and social  services based on residential history and existing social capital within healthcare systems.       Priorities of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and NIH Office of AIDS Research include  increasing retention in HIV care and viral suppression among racial/ethnic minorities and people  who inject drugs. The proposed longitudinal study directly aligns with these priorities by (1)  identifying new modifiable neighborhood determinants of lapses in retention in HIV care and

"Understanding secondary prevention along the HIV care continuum among HIV+ Thai YMSM Project Summary  The HIV crisis in Bangkok men who have sex with men (MSM) is volatile with 31% HIV-infected and HIV incidence unbridled and ranging from 8.8% to 12.2% annually in young MSM (YMSM) aged 15-24 years. Consequently, HIV incidence in Bangkok YMSM is Asia’s highest, and in the absence of effective primary and secondary HIV prevention, will continue to increase. Scaling up ART has become the highest priority in responding to this crisis in Thailand. However, data are not available on the HIV care continuum, thus severely limiting critical information needed to design evidence-based secondary prevention interventions for linkage, retention and reengagement in HIV care. In accordance with the R21 funding mechanism, this exploratory study seeks to use the adapted socio-ecological framework to 1) conduct formative research with +YMSM, HIV clinicians and CBO leaders to investigatethe multi-level factors related to the HIV care continuum in Bangkok +YMSM; and 2) quantify the HIV care continuum in +YMSM, and examine the associated facilitators and barriers through a 9-month longitudinal, virtual cohort. A sub aim is to assess the feasibility of an online +YMSM cohort for future online intervention trials. Data from this proposed study by a new investigator will identify which secondary prevention strategies must be scaled in order to meet UNAIDS’ 90-90-90 goals. Findings from this study will not only fill critical gaps in the HIV care continuum literature, it will identify subgroups of +YMSM who are most left out from the health system and to whom targeted secondary prevention interventions should be developed. Project Narrative  There is an HIV crisis among young men who have sex with men (YMSM, 15 to 24 years) in Bangkok where 3 in 10 are positive. Scaling up ART among Bangkok +YMSM is critical to prevent onward transmission of HIV.This exploratory study will respond to this crisis by characterizing the HIV care continuum among +YMSM using an adapted multi-level socio-ecological framework. Data from this proposed study will inform the design and implementation of secondary prevention strategies to link, retain and reengage Bangkok +YMSM in HIV care.",Understanding secondary prevention along the HIV care continuum among HIV+ Thai YMSM,9459827,R21AI125042,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Asia ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Public Health ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' forced sex ', ' Rape ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Social isolation ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Thailand ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' uptake ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Visit ', ' cohort ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIAID,MAHIDOL UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,145489,0.18475336167875628
"Disparities in Nursing Home Care Quality for Patients Living with HIV/AIDS Project Summary Thanks to the success of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US are living longer, and aging. With this success comes the new challenge of meeting the increasing need for nursing home (NH) care. Caring for these patients is complex. Aging PLWH experience complications of HIV and ART, high rates of HIV-Associated Non-AIDS conditions such as liver and lung disease, and high rates mental health disorders. Most NH providers have little experience caring for persons with this combination of medical issues. Unfortunately, very little is known about NH care for PLWH, such as what facilities they are admitted to, the quality of the care they receive, and the outcomes of that care. Absent such information it will not be possible to prepare and train NH staff to effectively and efficiently care for the large numbers of aging PLWH who in the next decade will need their care. The long term goal of this research is to drive the development of efficient, high quality NH care for PLWH. The objective of this application, the first step toward this long term goal, is to assemble and analyze national, population based data about the quality of, and variations in, NH care for PLWH. The central hypothesis motivating this proposal is that there are disparities in NH care for PLWH. We hypothesize, first, that PLWHs are likely to be admitted to lower quality NHs (“between” NH effects), and, second, that they are likely to get poorer care than HIV negative (HIV-) patients in those NHs (“within” NH effects). These hypotheses are based on several observations, including that disparities in care have been consistently found for PLWH, that hospitalization rates for HIV in the ART era have fallen so most NHs have not needed to learn how to provide post-acute (i.e., post-hospital) care for PLWH, and that there are volume- outcome relationships have been previously demonstrated in HIV care. The rationale for this work is that it will provide an evidence base for interventions to improve the quality of NH care for PLWH. The sample for this project will include PLWH admitted to NHs in nine high HIV prevalence states between 2001 and 2012, including those with Medicaid, Medicare, and Dual Eligibles. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Compare indicators of overall quality of NHs that have low, medium, and high experience caring for PLWH. 2) Compare the quality of care experienced by Medicaid HIV+ and HIV- patients in low, medium, and high HIV experience NHs. 3) Identify education, training, and attitudinal factors related to HIV care that differentiate high and low experience and high and low quality NHs from each other. We will accomplish this through qualitative interviews with Directors of Nursing from NHs selected based on findings from Aims 1-2. This approach is innovative because we propose is new ways to understand disparities in NH care for PLWH. The approach is significant because population-based data about the quality of care in the post-acute care sector for patients with HIV is a necessary precondition for evidence based clinical and policy interventions aimed at achieving the triple aim of better care, better health, and lower cost. PROJECT NARRATIVE Because of the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies (ART), patients with HIV infection are living longer. However, HIV infection and chronic ART use, in combination with the normal aging process, are producing new kinds of morbidity and disability for persons with HIV, including hospitalizations and the need for post- hospital or post-acute care. Understanding more about the quality and outcomes of post-acute care for persons with HIV can contribute in important ways to improving care quality, reducing the burdens of illness and disability, reducing disparities, and decreasing care costs for persons with HIV.",Disparities in Nursing Home Care Quality for Patients Living with HIV/AIDS,9474679,R01MH109394,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Family ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Services ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Liver diseases ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' hepatic disease ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nurse Administrator ', ' Vice President for Nursing ', ' Nurse Executive ', ' Director of Nursing ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' meetings ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' success ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV therapy ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' longterm care nursing ', ' Nursing Home Nursing ', ' Long-Term Care Nursing ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' dual eligible ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' normal aging ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' HIV anti-retroviral ', ' HIV antiretroviral ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' care costs ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' ']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,691827,0.05742021708285582
"Disparities in the HIV Care Continuum among Hispanics in the United States ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic has disproportionately affected the Hispanic population in the United States (US). Hispanics face the second-highest prevalence and incidence rates of HIV. Hispanics are also more likely to receive HIV care at later stages of HIV disease progression relative to any other racial or ethnic group. A complex set of unique individual- and structural-level factors confront this population and contribute to the burden of health disparities in HIV care and treatment experienced by Hispanics. In 2015, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States: Updated to 2020 (NHAS) set forth goals to reduce HIV-related disparities in high-risk populations, such as Hispanics, and to increase the proportion of individuals successfully engaged at all levels of the spectrum of HIV care and treatment. This spectrum, termed the HIV care continuum (HIVCC), has become a high-priority area for intervention. Increasing the proportions of HIV-infected individuals who progress through and ultimately reach the last stage of the HIVCC (viral suppression) has been shown to prevent over 90% of new HIV infections. To address the Hispanic population's unique HIV-related needs, it is critical to monitor trends in HIV care indicators for improvement over time and to identify the factors underlying HIV care in this population for the development of tailored public health interventions. We aim to: 1) estimate trends in the proportion of adult Hispanics that were in the last three steps of the HIVCC (retention in HIV care, prescription of antiretrovirl therapy [ART], and viral suppression) from 2004 to 2014; 2) identify demographic factors and behavioral targets for interventions to improve retention in HIV care, ART use, and viral suppression among Hispanic adults in HIV care in the US; and 3) explore the nature of progression through the last three steps of the HIVCC among adult Hispanics and identify the structural-level barriers and facilitators influencing this progression using qualitative research methods. For Aims 1 and 2, we will use data from the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD). The NA-ACCORD offers the largest-available source of longitudinal data on HIV- infected Hispanics (>15,000) in the US and has been endorsed by the Institute of Medicine as an appropriate data source for monitoring progress in NHAS goals. We will conduct qualitative in-depth interviews (N=25) with HIV-infected Hispanics in Baltimore City in Aim 3 to obtain a rich, complementary understanding of structural- level factors influencing HIVCC proportions among Hispanics. The results of this research will inform strategies designed to achieve NHAS goals to reduce health disparities and improve HIV care among Hispanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics in the United States face unique, complex challenges to HIV prevention, medical care, and treatment, demonstrating the imperative need for public health interventions that are specifically tailored to this important population. The results of the proposed research will provide a strong basis with which to inform interventions designed to reduce persistent HIV-related health disparities by increasing the proportion of Hispanics that are retained in HIV clinical care, are prescribed antiretroviral therapy, and ultimately achieve HIV viral suppression. Increased rates of viral suppression among Hispanics will, in turn, contribute to reduced HIV transmission and improved HIV-related health outcomes in this population.",Disparities in the HIV Care Continuum among Hispanics in the United States,9507763,F31AI124794,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Baltimore ', ' Cities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Persons ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' virology ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nature ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Viral ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Population Attributable Risks ', ' attributable fraction ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' public health intervention ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,49524,0.24263908330845893
"Effect of Peer Navigation and Contingency Management on Retention in HIV Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Consistent treatment with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral load (VL), prolonging life and improving quality of life for HIV+ persons. Suppressing VL benefits communities by reducing transmission to others. Mere availability of ART and care, however, is insufficient; the benefits of ART depend upon HIV+ persons' continuous visits to the health care provider, regular monitoring and regular delivery of medications, - known as retention in HIV care. In spite of national efforts, up to a quarter of HIV+ persons, especially low- income minorities, are out of care. Innovative interventions are therefore urgently needed to maximize engagement and retention in HIV care, self-reported adherence, as well as HIV-1 RNA viral load suppression. In pursuit of these aims, the proposed study will assess outcomes of the following interventions in comparison to usual care: 1) contingency management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that integrates both CM and PN (CA).  The interventions will then be implemented and evaluated in a fully powered Randomized Control Trial (RCT) using 1) contingency management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that integrates both CM and PN (CA).  to examine the effect of the interventions (CM and PN) compared to one another, to their combination (CA) and to usual care. A total of 660 inadequately retained individuals (165/group) will be recruited from publically-funded clinics providing HIV Care in Los Angeles County (LAC). These 495 intervention and 165 controls will be assessed through interviews, VL tests and electronic record review for HIV care visits. The evaluation will address retention in HIV care, use of ART medications, and viral load suppression outcomes, as well as intermediate variables, such as barriers to care, substance use, mental health, social support, self-efficacy, knowledge, stigma, and other factors that may affect the effectiveness of the intervention. We will also assess the costs of the intervention and potential cost savings from long-term intervention outcomes (cost offset and cost-effectiveness). If shown to be effective and cost-effective, this study could have substantial, widespread impact on both individual and public health in Los Angeles and other major metropolitan areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research strongly suggests that racial and ethnic disparities substantially and persistently affect retention in HIV care rates. In order to improve both individual and community HIV prevention and care outcomes, innovative interventions are urgently needed to target the underlying factors that contribute to these disparities in care. We therefore propose to evaluate the effectiveness of two distinct and promising cognitive behavioral strategy interventions: Peer Navigation (PN) and Contingency Management (CM), and their combination to optimize retention in HIV care among a vulnerable population of HIV+ individuals served by a safety net health care system that includes the second largest epicenter of HIV+ persons in

"Connecting People, Places, and Barriers:  The Effect of These Connections on Adhe DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a trained health geographer with expertise in the areas of social-ecological models, neighborhood effects, and Geographic Information System, I am further interested in expanding my research foci in the interface of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS, both from methodological and intervention perspectives. To that end, in the upcoming five years of training, I will devote my time to focused research on multidimensional correlates to adherence, retention, and HIV treatment outcomes among infected drug users using system science techniques. The ultimate goal is to design interventions to improve HIV treatment outcomes among this vulnerable population. To achieve this goal, I will work with an internationally recognized group of mentors to obtain training in the epidemiology of substance use disorders, HIV transmission and treatment, social network analysis, and design of interventions. My specific objectives to achieve this career goal are: 1. Enhance my background and understanding of existing literature on behavioral and clinical interventions to  seek, test, treat, and retain in care among drug users with HIV infection. 2. A. Advance expertise in theory, visualization, and application of social network analysis, including  egocentric network, whole network, and longitudinal networks. Incorporate spatial dependency to  innovatively advance social network metrics to spatial-social network metrics.  B. Develop expertise in research methods necessary to design, perform, and evaluate randomized  controlled trials. 3. Gain experience in intervention development, testing, implementation, and dissemination that will address  multidimensional barriers to adherence and retention in care among HIV positive drug users. 4. Development of an independent career path in behavioral intervention-oriented research focused on the  intersection between substance abuse and HIV by successfully writing and receipt of a R01 grant.  Given the vital importance of mentoring in the process of training and career development, I have assembled a strong interdisciplinary panel of mentors and consultants who will provide guidance throughout my five years of advanced training. Dr. Frederick Altice will serve as my primary mentor (substance abuse, HIV, intervention), with Drs. Michael Copenhaver (HIV, intervention) and Carl Latkin (social network analysis, neighborhood effects, intervention) as co-mentors. I will further consult Drs. Ofer Harel for biostatistics, Lesie Snyder for health communication, and Michael Emch for geographical theories of health research. The training will provide opportunities to conduct two research projects for vulnerable drug users with HIV infection. Study 1: To inform the development of an intervention by examining multidimensional (individual- social-ecological) correlates of adherence to ART, retention in care, and HIV treatment outcomes among drug using HIV positive population. [Year 1, 2, 3 (Part)] This is a secondary analysis using data from a randomized controlled trial (Project STRIDE, Altice, R01 DA030768) and its 'Social Network and Neighborhood' Supplement. To this I add the following aims:  Specific Aim 1: Extend social network metrics (i.e., derived from network structure) to spatial-social metrics (based on both network structure and spatial proximity between subjects and their network members).  Specific Aim 2: Visualize and map the 'activity space' patterns of subjects in a Geographic Information Science interface, including visits to routine locations of positive and negative influence. This is significantly different tha the just the residential location of the subjects.  Specific Aim 3: Examine the combined effect of individual, social relationships, activity space, and neighborhood correlates of adherence to ART, retention, and HIV treatment outcomes modeled on a robust multidimensional social-ecological framework. Study 2: To develop and pilot a spatial-network driven intervention with short message services (SMS) that will optimize adherence to ART, retention in care, and HIV treatment outcomes for HIV positive drug users. [Year 3(Part), 4, 5]  Phase 1: Select social network members (or alters) who will have stronger effect on the subjects (or egos) adherence to ART, retention, and HIV treatment outcomes. Formative evaluations of ego's activity space and composition and features of their social networks from Study 1 will determine the selection protocol. Phase 2: Conduct a pilot to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacyof a novel spatial- network driven intervention with SMS. The intervention has three arms: 1) Ego in HIV care with two alters assigned highest Interaction Index value, living inside ego's activity space receiving SMS, 2) Egos in HIV care with two alters assigned highest Interaction Index values, living outside the activity space receiving SMS, and 3) Egos in HIV care with no intervention (observational arm). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: First, identify barriers to adherence, retention in care, and HIV treatment outcomes among drug users with HIV infection using a multidimensional (individual, social relationships, activity space, and neighborhoods) social- ecological framework. Second, using correlates from these dimensions (specifically geographic proximity and interaction with social network members) a spatial-network-driven intervention is developed to improve adherence and HIV treatment outcomes. These projects will address the critical retention component of HIV treatment cascade and reduce ""fall-offs"" among positive drug users.","Connecting People, Places, and Barriers:  The Effect of These Connections on Adhe",9535264,K01DA037794,"['Research Project Grants ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' Drug user ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Dependence ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' opioid dependent ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' International ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' health training ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population health ', ' arm ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' peer networks ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' retention rate ', ' formative evaluation ', ' formative assessment ', ' medication-assisted treatment ', ' secondary analysis ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Career Choice ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Using MOST to optimize an HIV care continuum intervention for vulnerable populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than half of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. are insufficiently engaged in HIV primary care and not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), mainly African Americans and Latinos. In the proposed project, two experienced and productive behavioral scientists will employ a potent and innovative research methodology, the Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST), to develop a highly efficacious, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum. Whereas randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are valuable for evaluating the efficacy of multi-component interventions as a package, they are not designed to evaluate which specific components contribute to efficacy. MOST, a pioneering, engineering-inspired framework, addresses this problem through highly efficient randomized experimentation to assess the performance of individual intervention components and their interactions. We propose to use MOST to engineer an intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum for African American and Latino PLHA not well engaged in care and not taking ART. Further, the intervention will be optimized for cost-effectiveness. This efficiency and cost-effectiveness are critical in a time of constrained resources, and will also increase the intervention's future scalability. NIH has signaled its interest in MOST, and this is the first study to apply it in the ield of adult HIV treatment. A similar set of multi-level factors impede both HIV care and ART initiation for African American and Latino PLHA, primary among them individual (e.g., substance use, distrust, fear), social (e.g., stigma), and structural-level barriers (e.g., difficulties accesing ancillary services). Guided by a multi-level social cognitive theory, the study will evaluate 5 distinct intervention components (i.e., Motivational Interviewing sessions, pre-adherence preparation, support groups, peer mentorship, and patient navigation), each designed to address a specific barrier to HIV care and ART initiation. These components are well-grounded in the empirical literature and were found acceptable, feasible, and promising with respect to efficacy in a preliminary study. Study aims are: 1) using a highly efficient experimental design, identify which of 5 components contribute meaningfully to improvement in viral suppression, and secondary outcomes of ART adherence and engagement in HIV primary care; 2) identify mediators and moderators of component efficacy; and 3) using a mathematical modeling approach, build the most cost-effective and efficient intervention package from the efficacious components. A heterogeneous sample of African American and Latino PLHA (with respect to age, substance use, and sexual minority status) will be recruited with a proven hybrid sampling method using targeted sampling in community settings and peer recruitment (N=512). This highly innovative and significant study, which addresses a high- priority research area (NIH NOT-OD-15-137), will produce an HIV care continuum intervention for the nation's most vulnerable PLHA, optimized for cost-effectiveness, and with exceptional levels of efficacy, efficiency, and scalability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study targets the large population of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. who are both insufficiently engaged in HIV primary care and not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), who are mainly African American/Black and Latino. NIH has emphasized the urgent need for new research approaches to advance intervention science, and the proposed project employs a new, potent, and innovative research methodology, the Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST), a framework for developing highly efficacious, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective interventions. The proposed study has the highest public health significance: it addresses a vulnerable population of PLHA, including the critically important subpopulations of men who have sex with men (MSM) and substance users; will develop an efficient and cost effective intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum for these vulnerable groups; and addresses two areas highlighted in the August 2015 notice on research priorities from the NIH Office of AIDS Research (NOT-OD-15-137) , namely, engaging PLHA in prevention/treatment services, and reducing HIV/AIDS-related racial/ethnic disparities.",Using MOST to optimize an HIV care continuum intervention for vulnerable populations,9459340,R01DA040480,"['Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Self Determination ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Research Priority ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Preparation ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' sexual minority ', ' intrinsic motivation ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Hair ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Hybrids ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,1424376,0.19543391353938494
"Unified Intervention to Impact HIV Care Continuum This pragmatic adaptive clinical trial will test the effects of a Stigma-Motivational-Decision intervention designed to increase HIV treatment engagement, retention, and medication adherence for substance using adolescents and young adults (AYA) living with HIV who are not in clinical care. The intervention uses a uniquely unified counseling approach at multiple points along the HIV continuum of care. In a first step, we will use multiple modes of outreach including social media, passive media, clinic records, and chain referrals to seek and identify HIV positive AYA (age 16 to 25) who are out of HIV care. In Step 2, HIV positive AYA who are out of HIV care and substance using will be enrolled in a phone-delivered counseling intervention to address substance use, HIV stigmas, medical care-related concerns, structural barriers, and other challenges to engaging youth in HIV care. Counseling will be provided weekly until the time participants are engaged in care, with a maximum of 12 sessions (up 3-months). We will therefore determine the number of theory-based phone intervention sessions needed (minimally effective dose) for care engagement and the associated costs. Once engaged in care, Step 3 will conduct a randomized trial to test the comparative effects and cost effectiveness of interactive text messaging with opportunities for ongoing supportive problem solving versus text message reminders to sustain long-term retention in care and medication adherence. HIV positive AYA are likely to drop out of care because of known challenges such as substance use, social barriers such as stigma, and concerns regarding treatment. Our 3-step study will use a single theory-based approach to determine the number of phone-delivered Stigma-Motivational-Decision counseling intervention sessions necessary to achieve engagement or re-engagement in HIV care, and will test the effects of a low-cost approach to sustaining long-term retention in care and medication adherence. Participants will be out of care at baseline and counseled with up to 12 weekly phone-delivered intervention sessions until they confirm engagement in HIV care. The study will determine the minimally effective counseling dose needed to engage substance using HIV positive AYA in care. Once participants attend HIV medical appointments, they will be randomized to either: (a) 15-months of ongoing weekly mobile phone text message check-ins with the opportunity for brief problem-focused phone support or (b) weekly text message reminders. The study will test the effects of the counseling and text messaging interventions on maintaining HIV care retention, medication adherence, and HIV viral suppression over 18-months. The primary endpoint in this trial is HIV RNA suppression. We will perform economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of the engagement-retention-adherence intervention. The proposed pragmatic adaptive trial will therefore determine the minimally effective dose of counseling and the effects of a low-burden retention/adherence intervention to maintain retention in care and avoid relapse to non-adherence for AYA living with HIV. Retention in HIV care and persistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy effectively manages HIV infection, suppresses HIV replication, preserves the immune system, and reduces HIV infectiousness. Unfortunately, young people living with HIV who use alcohol and other drugs are often out of care or at risk of dropping out of HIV care. The proposed research will conduct a pragmatic adaptive clinical trial to determine the number of theory-based behavioral counseling sessions needed to engage young individuals in HIV care, and compare two text messaging interventions designed to support long-term retention in HIV care, medication adherence, and HIV viral suppression.",Unified Intervention to Impact HIV Care

"PROMISE - Program Refinements to Optimize Model Impact and Scalability based on Evidence Abstract  In New York, the achievement of 90-90-90 goals is jeopardized not by limited access to affordable care and treatment, but by persistent disparities in HIV viral suppression (VS). Complex behavioral and structural barriers to achieving and maintaining VS require coordinated, combination approaches to meet medical and social service needs. In 2009, at 28 Ryan White Part A (RWPA)-funded agencies, the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) launched a multi-component HIV Care Coordination Program (CCP) directed toward the most vulnerable, high-need persons living with HIV (PLWH) in NYC. A systematic CCP effectiveness study began in 2013 (R01 MH101028; PIs: Irvine, Nash). Findings to date suggest that the CCP is superior to usual care for high-need subgroups of PLWH, but there remains substantial room for improvement in short- and long-term VS. In an immediate evidence-to- practice feedback loop, the DOHMH is implementing a refined CCP model in 2018. Greater focusing, tailoring and cues for delivery of key components are expected to increase CCP engagement, reach, fidelity, scalability, effectiveness and impact. The aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Estimate the effectiveness of the revised (vs. original) CCP on timely VS (≤4 months), using experimental methods (Aim 1); 2) Estimate the effectiveness of the revised CCP (vs. `usual care') on longer-term VS, including VS at 12 months and durable viral suppression (DVS) at 24-36 months, using rigorous observational comparison group methods (Aim 2); and 3) Identify attributes and drivers of provider and client engagement in the intervention and provider and client preferences for future revised-CCP delivery and receipt (Aim 3). Prior studies have not demonstrated any intervention to be effective at improving short- and long-term VS among the many PLWH with major barriers to HIV care continuum engagement. The proposed study, to be conducted on a large scale in real-world HIV service settings, will document the rollout and effects of evidence-informed implementation course corrections to an intervention model focused on these most vulnerable PLWH. In this way, the work will advance a second generation of interventions capable of strengthening the care continuum among PLWH who have been unable to achieve desired ART outcomes in existing interventions, due to major structural or psychosocial barriers. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health  The proposed large-scale study will test the hypotheses of a revised HIV care coordination intervention's benefits over the original intervention and over `usual care,' with respect to both short-term and long-term clinical outcomes. This project brings together multiple data sources for tracking HIV care continuum completion in relation to publicly funded services, to guide HIV policymakers in New York and elsewhere in making critical decisions about program adjustments to optimize viral load suppression with limited available resources. Through a partnership including the Institute for Implementation Science and Population Health at the City University of New York, the New York City Health Department and six direct service provider agencies, findings from the proposed study will immediately be translated to HIV services planning and practice improvements, thus reducing HIV-related mortality and morbidity and preventing further HIV transmission.",PROMISE - Program Refinements to Optimize Model Impact and Scalability based on Evidence,9580619,R01MH117793,"['Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' unstably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' instably housed ', ' housing instability ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' implementation science ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' population health ', ' course implementation ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' service providers ', ' Service setting ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Cities ', ' Client ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Cues ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Epidemic ', ' Evolution ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' ']",NIMH,GRADUATE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH POLICY,R01,2018,539704,0.12983542059462055
"Women-centered HIV care practices that facilitate HIV care retention and viral suppression in the presence of adverse sociocultural factors PROJECT SUMMARY Achieving high rates of retention in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy leads to high rates of viral suppression, which not only reduces mortality and improves quality of living, among people living with HIV infection, but also reduces HIV transmission within affected communities. HIV care outcomes among women have been suboptimal; in 2014, viral suppression was 52.6% among African Americans, 57.9% among Whites, and 59.8% among Latinas compared with 66.0% among White men. Women living with HIV infection are more likely to face barriers to successful HIV care such as child care burden, abuse, and extreme poverty than men. In addition, women, in particular women of color, can face multiple layers of stigma including those related to their race, ethnicity, HIV infection, drug use, and poverty status. Partly because the HIV epidemic initially affected mostly men, the HIV care system is not designed to meet women's special needs. Implementing women-centered HIV care has been proposed nationally and internationally as a way to address women's needs. However, this idea has not been well operationalized for HIV care and has not been examined in the context of the United States health care system including the Ryan White Program, which serves 65% of women living with HIV in the United States. Our central hypothesis is that the more women-centric a system is, the higher the likelihood of HIV care retention and viral suppression among women. The objective of this application is to identify effective provider and system women-centered HIV care practices within the Ryan White Program that positively influence HIV care retention and viral suppression among women experiencing sociocultural challenges. We will accomplish this objective with a mixed methods study examining patient intake and billing data from women enrolled in the Miami-Dade County Ryan White Program, conducting in-depth interviews with case managers, health care providers, administrators, and women living with HIV, and conducting a survey of 600 women living with HIV in the Miami- Dade County Ryan White Program. We propose the following three specific aims: 1) Identify sociocultural factors that influence HIV care retention and viral suppression, including those unique to women and those having a differential impact on African American, Haitian and Latina women; 2) Ascertain current and potential health care provider and system women-centered HIV care practices that may mitigate the effect of adverse sociocultural factors on HIV care retention and antiretroviral therapy adherence; 3) Identify specific health care provider and system women-centered HIV care practices that most strongly influence HIV care retention, adherence, and viral suppression among all women and in African American, Haitian and Latina women. This project addresses the National HIV/AIDS Strategy goals to increase access to care, improve health outcomes, and reduce HIV-related health disparities and the Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-Related Research call for research to promote HIV care engagement and to reduce disparities in treatment outcomes. NARRATIVE There is a critical need to improve HIV care outcomes and reduce health disparities among women living with HIV infection for their individual benefit and the benefit of their communities. This project will involve analysis of Ryan White Program administrative client intake and billing data, interviews of health care providers, case managers, and administrators, and interviews with women who are patients in the Ryan White HIV care program to identify effective ways for the health care system to better serve the needs of women, especially minority women, living with HIV infection.",Women-centered HIV care practices that facilitate HIV care retention and viral suppression in the presence of adverse sociocultural factors,9658129,R01MD013563,"['Affect ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Client ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Administrator ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Immigrant ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' metropolitan ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' therapy adherence ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' Intake ', ' International ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' care burden ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' billing data ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' retention rate ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' improved outcome ', ' Haitian ', ' Cuban ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,478211,0.27172353386086995
"mHealth for ART adherence by HIV+ African Americans age 45 & older ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environment and Health Group (EHG), Inc., in collaboration with a number of Boston MA and Columbia SC based organizations, seeks to enhance, test, and commercialize an individually-tailored, culturally-sensitive, positive-psychology and behavioral-economics based, mobile health intervention to promote ART adherence, increase ART self-efficacy and reduce feelings of stress burden among HIV positive African Americans age 45 and older. African Americans represent a growing portion (41%) of people living with HIV (CDC, 2012; 2014); by 2015, those age 50+ will account for half of all cases of HIV/AIDS in the U.S. (NIDA, 2012). Poor ART adherence contributes to disparities in HIV/AIDS outcomes among older African Americans. The proposed project is based on EHG's previous research with HIV+, age 50 years and older, African American adults. That research revealed personalized pill reminder text messages with positive-psychology based motivational and educational messages are effective at addressing two major barriers to ART adherence in this group: 1) memory deficits resulting from the combined effects of HIV, cognitive aging, and increased allostatic load, and 2) low motivation due to lack of ART self efficacy and negative affect. Findings showed significant improvement in ART adherence scores and marginally significant improvement in ART self- efficacy scores. While affect scores did not change, qualitative findings showed the intervention helped reduce feelings of stress burden. Supporting ART adherence is key to reducing health disparities among HIV+ African Americans. Doing so for those, age 45 and older-who are most vulnerable to cumulative, age-accelerating effects of HIV infection and allostatic load-is urgent, which is why we are lowering the age cut-off from 50 to 45 in Phase II. To date, no ART adherence support intervention has been developed for this highly-vulnerable group. The Phase II project will enhance the existing mobile intervention by offering: 1) a two-way communication capability through which participants can: i) indicate ""pill taken"" in response to pill reminders, and ii) receive a positive visual icon as behavioral-economics based reinforcement for ""pill taken"" responses; 2) live, real-time pharmacist counseling and medication support; and, 3) the addition of opt-in smoking cessation educational and motivational texts. Overall aims are to: 1) expand mhealth intervention to incorporate new Phase II features; 2) evaluate effectiveness in an RCT of HIV+ African Americans age 45 and older; and 3) prepare marketing and commercialization plans. Our long-term goal is to increase ART adherence, thus decreasing health disparities, among HIV+, African-Americans, age 45+. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: According to the CDC (2013), there are approximately 215,000 African Americans in the age group of 45 and older who are living with an HIV diagnosis. Unfortunately, many African-Americans will die earlier from HIV/AIDS than their white, non-Hispanic counterparts, due in large part, to lack of adherence to Antiretroviral therapy (ART). The proposed mhealth intervention seeks to increase ART adherence among HIV+ African- Americans, who are over the age of 45, thus improving health outcomes and reducing disparities in this group.",mHealth for ART adherence by HIV+ African Americans age 45 & older,9386667,R44MD007161,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Boston ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Communication ', ' Counseling ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Holidays ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Marketing ', ' Memory ', ' Morbidity -

"Using MOST to optimize an HIV care continuum intervention for vulnerable populations More than half of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. are insufficiently engaged in HIV primary care and not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), mainly African Americans and Latinos. In the proposed project, two experienced and productive behavioral scientists will employ a potent and innovative research methodology, the Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST), to develop a highly efficacious, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum. Whereas randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are valuable for evaluating the efficacy of multi-component interventions as a package, they are not designed to evaluate which specific components contribute to efficacy. MOST, a pioneering, engineering-inspired framework, addresses this problem through highly efficient randomized experimentation to assess the performance of individual intervention components and their interactions. We propose to use MOST to engineer an intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum for African American and Latino PLHA not well engaged in care and not taking ART. Further, the intervention will be optimized for cost-effectiveness. This efficiency and cost-effectiveness are critical in a time of constrained resources, and will also increase the intervention's future scalability. NIH has signaled its interest in MOST, and this is the first study to apply it in the field of adult HIV treatment. A similar set of multi-level factors impede both HIV care and ART initiation for African American and Latino PLHA, primary among them individual (e.g., substance use, distrust, fear), social (e.g., stigma), and structural-level barriers (e.g., difficulties accessing ancillary services). Guided by a multi-level social cognitive theory, the study will evaluate 5 distinct intervention components (i.e., Motivational Interviewing sessions, pre-adherence preparation, support groups, peer mentorship, and patient navigation), each designed to address a specific barrier to HIV care and ART initiation. These components are well-grounded in the empirical literature and were found acceptable, feasible, and promising with respect to efficacy in a preliminary study. Study aims are: 1) using a highly efficient experimental design, identify which of 5 components contribute meaningfully to improvement in viral suppression, and secondary outcomes of ART adherence and engagement in HIV primary care; 2) identify mediators and moderators of component efficacy; and 3) using a mathematical modeling approach, build the most cost-effective and efficient intervention package from the efficacious components. A heterogeneous sample of African American and Latino PLHA (with respect to age, substance use, and sexual minority status) will be recruited with a proven hybrid sampling method using targeted sampling in community settings and peer recruitment (N=512). This highly innovative and significant study, which addresses a high-priority research area (NIH NOT-OD-15-137), will produce an HIV care continuum intervention for the nation's most vulnerable PLHA, optimized for cost-effectiveness, and with exceptional levels of efficacy, efficiency, and scalability. Project Narrative: The present study targets the large population of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. who are both insufficiently engaged in HIV primary care and not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), who are mainly African American/Black and Latino. NIH has emphasized the urgent need for new research approaches to advance intervention science, and the proposed project employs a new, potent, and innovative research methodology, the Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST), a framework for developing highly efficacious, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective interventions. The proposed study has the highest public health significance: it addresses a vulnerable population of PLHA, including the critically important subpopulations of men who have sex with men (MSM) and substance users; will develop an efficient and cost effective intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum for these vulnerable groups; and addresses two areas highlighted in the August 2015 notice on research priorities from the NIH Office of AIDS Research (NOT-OD-15-137), namely, engaging PLHA in prevention/treatment services, and reducing HIV/AIDS-related racial/ethnic disparities.",Using MOST to optimize an HIV care continuum intervention for vulnerable populations,9925349,R01DA040480,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Hair ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Self Determination ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Research Priority ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Preparation ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' sexual minority ', ' intrinsic motivation ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,85495,0.19508084053099334
"Implementation of Seek, Test, Treat & Retain Strategies among People Who Inject Drugs in Malaysia Project Summary Most people living with HIV (PLWH) in Malaysia also have an opioid use disorder (OUD), yet only a minority receive ART and OUD treatment, resulting in increased mortality and HIV incidence. The proposed pragmatic, multisite, implementation and effectiveness research will evaluate a strategy to improve HIV treatment outcomes (increased rates of patients on ART with virological suppression, improved treatment retention and ART adherence) for PLWH with OUD. Engaging 4 large regional HIV/AIDS treatment centers in Malaysia, with a stepped rollout of the study protocol across the study sites, offset by one year with a random order of the sites initiation, the study will evaluate barriers and facilitators for implementation of improved care model and will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the model in a clinical trial. At each of the study sites, individuals testing HIV positive who also have OUD (n=4x70) will be enrolled to receive concurrent ART and MMT based on the usual care standards. Their patient level outcomes will be compared with individuals meeting the same inclusion criteria (n=4x70) and treated under the proposed improved model (post implementation evaluation). The usual care standard will consist of provision of ART and medical care for HIV and other medical HIV co- morbidities provided at the HIV/AIDS treatment center with an expedited and facilitated referral to a methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). The improved care model will include the usual care supplemented by continuing education and coaching of medical staff at HIV/AIDS and MMT clinics and by provision of additional peer-based counseling intervention focused on behavioral skills and strategies that patients can learn and master to achieve uninterrupted, long-term ART treatment participation while continuing OUD recovery through MMT. The primary outcome measure, rates of patients with virologic suppression (< 20 copies/mL) in the two care models will be assessed at 24 weeks. The secondary outcomes, also followed for 24 weeks, will include ART adherence measured by objective measures (tenofovir dried blood spots, clinic records) and self-report; decreased illicit opioid use measured by rates of opioid negative urine toxicology results and self-report; and improvements on other health-related and functional status outcomes. A statistically significant effect on the primary outcome and clinically meaningful effects on secondary outcomes favoring the improved care model are hypothesized. Concurrently at each study site, using implementation science mixed methods research tools and engaging key local stakeholders (treatment providers, patients, their families, and community activists), and evaluating clinical and healthcare data, the study will assess existing barriers (organizational, personnel, and community level factors) and uncover available resources and facilitators for a successful implementation of the improved care model. The research will provide critically important evidence for implementation of effective Seek-Test-Treat, and Retain models for PLWH and OUD throughout Malaysia and inform healthcare policy in other low to middle income countries and regions with limited healthcare resources. Project Narrative In Malaysia, similar to most countries where HIV-related mortality and incidence are concentrated in people who inject drugs (PWID), currently offered guideline-concordant HIV treatment for people living with HIV (PLWH) consists of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and medical care for HIV, hepatitis, TB, and other medical HIV co-morbidities provided at the specialty HIV/AIDS treatment center, but PLWH with co-occurring opioid use disorder (OUD) are referred to an outside OUD treatment program, typically a methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), and their ART initiation is delayed until they are stable in OUD recovery. Research and clinical evidence indicates that the overall effectiveness of this treatment model is low: only a small proportion of PLWH and OUD receive ART and MMT concurrently, and those who do, have low treatment adherence and/or discontinue both MMT and ART. The proposed pragmatic, multisite study will collect critically important evidence for overcoming barriers to implementation of fully integrated and effective Seek-Test-Treat and Retain (STTR) care models for PLWH with OUD in Malaysia, will provide a rigorous scientific test of the hypothesized comparative effectiveness advantage over the current models of care, and will inform healthcare policy guidelines in Malaysia and in other countries.","Implementation of Seek, Test, Treat & Retain Strategies among People Who Inject Drugs in Malaysia",9771403,R01DA047789,"['Blood ', ' Blood

"Corrections2Community: Post-release retention in HIV care for ex-inmates in South Africa PROJECT SUMMARY The availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has markedly reduced HIV-related mortality and morbidity in Africa. Yet HIV remains the leading cause of death among adult men and women in South Africa due fails to initiated ART or remain in care. Between 2 and 3% of HIV-infected men in South Africa pass through the corrections system annually. While incarcerated uptake of ART is excellent, unfortunately after release most are lost from care. Qualitative and quantitative research conducted by the research team with 492 ex-inmates in South Africa indicates that upon release from correctional settings, this population encounters confusion regarding where and when to receive care, long queueing times, family abandonment and limited social capital, enacted stigma, economic insecurity, and substance use (injection drug use reported by 11% of our participants). This project seeks to further characterize loss from care following release and to develop and pilot test a group support and HIV care model to retain ex-inmates in HIV care. This support group approach is based on adapting the South African community adherence clubs for a special vulnerable population. Such a care and support group for ex-inmates transitioning in care (a transition community adherence club or TCAC) has the potential to simultaneously address the multiple barriers to medical care through addressing social and care delivery barriers. We hypothesize that intervening on these levels will impact retention in care, virologic suppression, morbidity, and HIV transmission. The current proposal will allow for the development and piloting of this TCAC strategy to improve HIV care for ex-inmates to increase knowledge regarding care engagement for ex-inmates and to prepare for a randomized clinical trial of the TCAC powered for an effectiveness outcome of in-care with an undetectable viral load at 6 months after release.

"Multi-level Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health and Missed HIV Healthcare Provider Visits Project Summary/Abstract  Despite the benefits of engagement in HIV care, a substantial number of black people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are poorly retained in care in the United States. An individual's race cannot fully explain these observed disparities in retention in HIV care. Social and behavioral determinants of health including an individual's actions, social/physical environment, and access to health services are also modifiable contributors. However, studies on the combined impact of individual-, community-, infrastructure/health system-, and structural-level social and behavioral determinants of health on retention in HIV care, with specific attention to race, are lacking. The aims of this study are: 1) To develop and validate a predictive model which will include race as well as social and behavioral determinants of heath from multiple levels (individual-, community-, infrastructure/health system-, and structural-level) and; 2) To identify modifiable individual-level patient-reported outcomes (i.e. mental health, alcohol and substance use, quality of life, symptom burden) which partially or fully mediate the relationship between black race and missed visits, after accounting for less easily modifiable, community-and structural-level confounders. These results will inform the design of an intervention package aimed to reduce missed HIV healthcare provider visits for black patients, a population disproportionately affected by poor HIV health-related outcomes. Additionally, they will provide a predictive model that will allow point-of-care ascertainment of risk of missing visits in order to target this intervention package toward black patients most likely to benefit.  This research team is uniquely positioned to complete the work proposed in this application. The principal investigator, Dr. Pettit has significant experience in conducting epidemiologic studies of HIV outcomes in large multi-cohort collaborations. Dr. Mugavero, a co-investigator on this proposal, brings content expertise in retention in HIV care and experience conducting studies of HIV outcomes within the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Drs. Shepherd, Rebeiro, and Turan, also co-investigators on this proposal, bring complimentary skills in biostatistics and epidemiology as well as behavioral science and psychometrics required to carry out the analytic plan. Other resources available to the research team include Vanderbilt's Clinical and Translational Science Award, the Tennessee and University of Alabama Centers for AIDS Research, and the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) Core services.  The proposed studies will provide important insights into the contribution of factors from multiple levels on missed HIV healthcare provider visits among black PLWHA in the United States. Moreover, these findings will inform the design and evaluation of a future intervention or support package aimed at modifiable social and behavioral determinants of health in order to improve health outcomes and reduce racial disparities for HIV- infected persons. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance Social and behavioral determinants of health are known to contribute to poorer retention in HIV care and increased HIV-related mortality among black patients in the United States. Our understanding of these determinants from multiple levels (individual, community, infrastructure/health system, and structural levels) and their influence on racial disparities in missing HIV healthcare provider visits is incomplete. Further characterization of the association of social and behavioral determinants of health from multiple levels with retention in HIV care among blacks is critical for the development and evaluation of intervention support packages aimed to decrease the number of missed clinic visits and mortality in this population.",Multi-level Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health and Missed HIV Healthcare Provider Visits,9617291,R01MH113438,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Attention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Black race ', ' Budgets ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Criminal Law ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychometrics ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Tennessee ', ' Triage ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' virusemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' viraemia ', ' Viremia ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Health Care Visit ', ' Healthcare Visit ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,388719,0.15681953362650117
"Delivering High-Quality HIV Care in the South: System-Level Policy Alternatives PROJECT SUMMARY While clinical care for HIV has made tremendous advances, the majority of persons living with HIV in the US do not receive the evidence-based care that will allow them to fully extend life and improve health. Lack of effective HIV care is particularly problematic in the Southern region, the epicenter of the US HIV epidemic and where poverty, uninsurance, rurality, and a constrained health workforce further threaten effective care. Research suggests that system-level factors, or the structural and policy-related aspects of health care delivery, have the potential to improve quality of care and health outcomes. But little is known about their role in the context of HIV care delivery, quality of care, and health outcomes. The proposed research will study how two modifiable system-level factors—geographic accessibility to care and physician payment policies—affect quality of HIV care and population outcomes, including new HIV infections, along the HIV care continuum in the US South. Because racial and ethnic minorities face increased barriers to HIV care, we pay special attention to how these system-level factors may contribute to disparities in quality of HIV care and population outcomes along the HIV care continuum. The research involves developing a novel database that combines multiple data sources, including Medicaid administrative claims files, HIV surveillance data, and county and state characteristics from national datasets. Our approach will rely on state-of-the-art spatial network analysis and data visualization (mapping), statistical tests using econometric methods, and systems science forecasting techniques that have been used to study quality of care and population health outcomes. The work moves beyond examination of core quality of HIV care measures to include HIV-related preventive care measures that collectively are critical to reducing HIV morbidity and mortality. In investigating these factors, the study will answer a number of important questions. How do geographic accessibility, measured in travel time to receive care, and physician payment for services affect quality of HIV care in the South? Are these effects different among racial and ethnic minorities? Do improvements in geographic accessibility or increased physician payments reduce new HIV infections and racial and ethnic disparities along the HIV care continuum? The proposed study will address these questions and others. By quantifying the role of system-level factors in quality of HIV care and population health along the HIV care continuum, as well as understanding disparities in these effects, the research will provide valuable information to state and federal policy makers who seek to address systemic challenges to effective HIV care, efficiently allocate scarce resources, and improve public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Improving geographic access to care (measured in travel time to receive care) and assuring adequate physician payments for services are potential pathways to improve care for HIV patients in the Southern states, the center of the US HIV epidemic. This project investigates the effects of these pathways on quality of HIV care and on population health, including new HIV infections, and the differences in these effects across populations--particularly racial and ethnic minorities who face increased barriers to HIV care. This study will guide future federal and state policy regarding the geographic placement of HIV services and payments for physicians, which will lead to improved health for HIV patients in the US South.",Delivering High-Quality HIV Care in the South: System-Level Policy Alternatives,9689846,R01MD011277,"['Affect ', ' Appointment ', ' Attention ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Fasting ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incentives ', ' Lipids ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' vaccination against influenza ', ' influenza virus vaccination ', ' flu immunisation ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' federal policy ', ' population health ', ' surveillance data ', ' data visualization ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' rurality ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NIMHD,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,375894,0.23241742546215244
"FANMI: Community Cohort Care for HIV-Infected Adolescent Girls in Haiti Abstract: Sexually active HIV-infected adolescent girls are an extremely vulnerable and underserved population. If treated promptly with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and retained in care, individuals have a near normal life expectancy. Further, ART will decrease vertical and sexual HIV transmission in a population who are sexually active, have high rates of pregnancy and multiple seronegative partners. However, in Haiti and other resource poor countries, HIV-infected adolescents are three times more likely to be lost from care than adults, with only approximately 50% of HIV-infected teens remaining in care at one year. We have developed FANMI (My Family), an innovative model to improve HIV care for adolescent girls. HIV- infected girls age 16-19 years attend monthly HIV care in cohorts of 5-8 peers. All HIV care takes place in a community center rather than in a medical clinic. Each monthly visit integrates clinical care, peer group counseling, and social activities in a single session by the same provider to simplify care and strengthen the relationships between peers and providers. Preliminary data from our pilot study suggest dramatic improvements in retention with 91% of girls remaining in care at one year. Primary Aim: To conduct a randomized controlled trial at the GHESKIO Center in Port au Prince, Haiti. We will randomize 160 HIV-infected girls age 16-19 years (80 per arm) to FANMI versus standard of care with the primary study endpoint being alive and in care at 12 months. We will have >80% power to detect an improvement in retention at 12 months from 60% in the standard group to 85% in FANMI. Secondary Aims: To compare FANMI versus standard care on the following outcomes:  a. Plasma HIV-1 RNA < 1000 copies/µl at 12 months. We predict that 30% of participants in the standard  arm will have a suppressed viral load at 12 months compared to 60% in the FAMNI arm due to improved  retention, increased visit attendance, and improved ART adherence.  b. Sexual risk behavior: self-reported sexual activity, condom use, incidence of sexually-transmitted infections,  and pregnancy rate over 12 months.  c. Acceptability: We will conduct in-depth interviews to evaluate FANMI and factors associated with retention.  d. Health care utilization and costs of FANMI versus standard care. FANMI has the potential to dramatically improve HIV-infected adolescent treatment outcomes across the HIV care cascade and serve as a model of adolescent HIV care in Haiti and other resource-poor countries. NARRATIVE Retention of adolescents in HIV care is essential for prevention of morbidity, mortality, and HIV transmission, but in Haiti, HIV-infected adolescents are three times more likely to be lost from HIV care than adults, with only 50% of HIV-infected teens remaining in care at one year. This study aims to evaluate a model of Cohort Care, in which HIV-infected adolescent girls are seen in the community in cohorts of 5-8 peers integrating clinical care, peer group counseling, and social activities in a single session by the same provider.

"Women-centered HIV care practices that facilitate HIV care retention and viral suppression in the presence of adverse sociocultural factors PROJECT SUMMARY Achieving high rates of retention in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy leads to high rates of viral suppression, which not only reduces mortality and improves quality of living, among people living with HIV infection, but also reduces HIV transmission within affected communities. HIV care outcomes among women have been suboptimal; in 2014, viral suppression was 52.6% among African Americans, 57.9% among Whites, and 59.8% among Latinas compared with 66.0% among White men. Women living with HIV infection are more likely to face barriers to successful HIV care such as child care burden, abuse, and extreme poverty than men. In addition, women, in particular women of color, can face multiple layers of stigma including those related to their race, ethnicity, HIV infection, drug use, and poverty status. Partly because the HIV epidemic initially affected mostly men, the HIV care system is not designed to meet women's special needs. Implementing women-centered HIV care has been proposed nationally and internationally as a way to address women's needs. However, this idea has not been well operationalized for HIV care and has not been examined in the context of the United States health care system including the Ryan White Program, which serves 65% of women living with HIV in the United States. Our central hypothesis is that the more women-centric a system is, the higher the likelihood of HIV care retention and viral suppression among women. The objective of this application is to identify effective provider and system women-centered HIV care practices within the Ryan White Program that positively influence HIV care retention and viral suppression among women experiencing sociocultural challenges. We will accomplish this objective with a mixed methods study examining patient intake and billing data from women enrolled in the Miami-Dade County Ryan White Program, conducting in-depth interviews with case managers, health care providers, administrators, and women living with HIV, and conducting a survey of 600 women living with HIV in the Miami- Dade County Ryan White Program. We propose the following three specific aims: 1) Identify sociocultural factors that influence HIV care retention and viral suppression, including those unique to women and those having a differential impact on African American, Haitian and Latina women; 2) Ascertain current and potential health care provider and system women-centered HIV care practices that may mitigate the effect of adverse sociocultural factors on HIV care retention and antiretroviral therapy adherence; 3) Identify specific health care provider and system women-centered HIV care practices that most strongly influence HIV care retention, adherence, and viral suppression among all women and in African American, Haitian and Latina women. This project addresses the National HIV/AIDS Strategy goals to increase access to care, improve health outcomes, and reduce HIV-related health disparities and the Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-Related Research call for research to promote HIV care engagement and to reduce disparities in treatment outcomes. NARRATIVE There is a critical need to improve HIV care outcomes and reduce health disparities among women living with HIV infection for their individual benefit and the benefit of their communities. This project will involve analysis of Ryan White Program administrative client intake and billing data, interviews of health care providers, case managers, and administrators, and interviews with women who are patients in the Ryan White HIV care program to identify effective ways for the health care system to better serve the needs of women, especially minority women, living with HIV infection.",Women-centered HIV care practices that facilitate HIV care retention and viral suppression in the presence of adverse sociocultural factors,9783884,R01MD013563,"['Affect ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Client ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Treatment outcome ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Immigrant ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' metropolitan ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' Intake ', ' International ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' care burden ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' billing data ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' improved outcome ', ' Haitian ', ' Cuban ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' ']",NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,444754,0.27172353386086995
"Disparities in Nursing Home Care Quality for Patients Living with HIV/AIDS Project Summary Thanks to the success of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US are living longer, and aging. With this success comes the new challenge of meeting the increasing need for nursing home (NH) care. Caring for these patients is complex. Aging PLWH experience complications of HIV and ART, high rates of HIV-Associated Non-AIDS conditions such as liver and lung disease, and high rates mental health disorders. Most NH providers have little experience caring for persons with this combination of medical issues. Unfortunately, very little is known about NH care for PLWH, such as what facilities they are admitted to, the quality of the care they receive, and the outcomes of that care. Absent such information it will not be possible to prepare and train NH staff to effectively and efficiently care for the large numbers of aging PLWH who in the next decade will need their care. The long term goal of this research is to drive the development of efficient, high quality NH care for PLWH. The objective of this application, the first step toward this long term goal, is to assemble and analyze national, population based data about the quality of, and variations in, NH care for PLWH. The central hypothesis motivating this proposal is that there are disparities in NH care for PLWH. We hypothesize, first, that PLWHs are likely to be admitted to lower quality NHs (“between” NH effects), and, second, that they are likely to get poorer care than HIV negative (HIV-) patients in those NHs (“within” NH effects). These hypotheses are based on several observations, including that disparities in care have been consistently found for PLWH, that hospitalization rates for HIV in the ART era have fallen so most NHs have not needed to learn how to provide post-acute (i.e., post-hospital) care for PLWH, and that there are volume- outcome relationships have been previously demonstrated in HIV care. The rationale for this work is that it will provide an evidence base for interventions to improve the quality of NH care for PLWH. The sample for this project will include PLWH admitted to NHs in nine high HIV prevalence states between 2001 and 2012, including those with Medicaid, Medicare, and Dual Eligibles. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Compare indicators of overall quality of NHs that have low, medium, and high experience caring for PLWH. 2) Compare the quality of care experienced by Medicaid HIV+ and HIV- patients in low, medium, and high HIV experience NHs. 3) Identify education, training, and attitudinal factors related to HIV care that differentiate high and low experience and high and low quality NHs from each other. We will accomplish this through qualitative interviews with Directors of Nursing from NHs selected based on findings from Aims 1-2. This approach is innovative because we propose is new ways to understand disparities in NH care for PLWH. The approach is significant because population-based data about the quality of care in the post-acute care sector for patients with HIV is a necessary precondition for evidence based clinical and policy interventions aimed at achieving the triple aim of better care, better health, and lower cost. PROJECT NARRATIVE Because of the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies (ART), patients with HIV infection are living longer. However, HIV infection and chronic ART use, in combination with the normal aging process, are producing new kinds of morbidity and disability for persons with HIV, including hospitalizations and the need for post- hospital or post-acute care. Understanding more about the quality and outcomes of post-acute care for persons with HIV can contribute in important ways to improving care quality, reducing the burdens of illness and disability, reducing disparities, and decreasing care costs for persons with HIV.",Disparities in Nursing Home Care Quality for Patients Living with HIV/AIDS,9692788,R01MH109394,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' hepatic disease ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Liver diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Vice President for Nursing ', ' Nurse Executive ', ' Director of Nursing ', ' Nurse Administrator ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' meetings ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' success ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV therapy ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Long-Term Care Nursing ', ' longterm care nursing ', ' Nursing Home Nursing ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' beneficiary ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' dual eligible ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' normal aging ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' LGB ', ' HIV antiretroviral ', ' HIV anti-retroviral ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' care costs ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' ']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,259798,0.05742021708285582
"Improving engagement in HIV care for high-risk women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender women (assigned `male' at birth but who do not identify as male) are disproportionately impacted by HIV and have culturally unique barriers and facilitators to engagement in HIV care. Transgender women living with HIV (TWH) are less likely than others to take antiretroviral therapy (ART), and those who initiate ART have lower rates of ART adherence, lower self-efficacy for integrating ART into daily routines, and report fewer positive interactions with health care providers than non-transgender adults. As a result, TWH have an almost three-fold higher viral load than non-transgender adults in San Francisco; in Los Angeles, TWH are less likely to be virally suppressed than any other behavioral risk group. In our formative work, we have identified culturally-specific and modifiable barriers to HIV treatment engagement among TWH, including prioritization of transition-related health care (i.e. hormone therapy) at the expense of HIV treatment, avoidance of HIV care settings due to past negative health care experiences, misinformation about ART including potential drug interactions with hormones, intensified HIV stigma, low levels of social support, and poor coping skills. There are both individual and public health consequences to poor engagement in care among TWH stemming from high transmission risk factors, including substance abuse, high numbers of sex partners, engagement in sex work, and high rates of mental illness. These findings strongly suggest that TWH face unique challenges to engaging in and adhering to HIV treatment, and that the public health consequences for poor engagement in this population are of grave concern. Interventions to mitigate these barriers to engagement in care are critical in efforts to alter the pattern of HIV-related disparities that lead to disproportionately poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable and marginalized population. We propose a randomized controlled trial of a theory- driven, population-specific, piloted intervention to improve engagement in care for TWH. Grounded in the investigators' Models of Gender Affirmation and Health Care Empowerment, the proposed research is the first to systematically intervene on complex barriers to optimal engagement in HIV care for TWH. We have developed and piloted the Healthy Divas intervention to optimize engagement in HIV care for TWH at elevated risk for treatment failure and consequential morbidity, mortality, and transmission of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed trial is grounded in a novel transgender-specific framework and is the culmination of years of work in a community at heightened risk for HIV treatment failure and transmission of HIV to others. If effective, the proposed intervention approach has the potential to optimize health outcomes in a population highly burdened by HIV while preventing further transmission.",Improving engagement in HIV care for high-risk women,9729070,R01MH106373,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Appointment ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Critical Care ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' male ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Silicones ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' virology ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Misinformation ', ' Coping Skills ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Shelter facility ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' uptake ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' health care model ', ' healthcare model ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' virus load ', ' Viral load measurement ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' trial comparing ', ' stem ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' Injections ', ' treatment risk ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,770361,0.1988959647999412
"Unified Intervention to Impact HIV Care Continuum This pragmatic adaptive clinical trial will test the effects of a Stigma-Motivational-Decision intervention designed to increase HIV treatment engagement, retention, and medication adherence for substance using adolescents and young adults (AYA) living with HIV who are not in clinical care. The intervention uses a uniquely unified counseling approach at multiple points along the HIV continuum of care. In a first step, we will use multiple modes of outreach including social media, passive media, clinic records, and chain referrals to seek and identify HIV positive AYA (age 16 to 25) who are out of HIV care. In Step 2, HIV positive AYA who are out of HIV care and substance using will be enrolled in a phone-delivered counseling intervention to address substance use, HIV stigmas, medical care-related concerns, structural barriers, and other challenges to engaging youth in HIV care. Counseling will be provided weekly until the time participants are engaged in care, with a maximum of 12 sessions (up 3-months). We will therefore determine the number of theory-based phone intervention sessions needed (minimally effective dose) for care engagement and the associated costs. Once engaged in care, Step 3 will conduct a randomized trial to test the comparative effects and cost effectiveness of interactive text messaging with opportunities for ongoing supportive problem solving versus text message reminders to sustain long-term retention in care and medication adherence. HIV positive AYA are likely to drop out of care because of known challenges such as substance use, social barriers such as stigma, and concerns regarding treatment. Our 3-step study will use a single theory-based approach to determine the number of phone-delivered Stigma-Motivational-Decision counseling intervention sessions necessary to achieve engagement or re-engagement in HIV care, and will test the effects of a low-cost approach to sustaining long-term retention in care and medication adherence. Participants will be out of care at baseline and counseled with up to 12 weekly phone-delivered intervention sessions until they confirm engagement in HIV care. The study will determine the minimally effective counseling dose needed to engage substance using HIV positive AYA in care. Once participants attend HIV medical appointments, they will be randomized to either: (a) 15-months of ongoing weekly mobile phone text message check-ins with the opportunity for brief problem-focused phone support or (b) weekly text message reminders. The study will test the effects of the counseling and text messaging interventions on maintaining HIV care retention, medication adherence, and HIV viral suppression over 18-months. The primary endpoint in this trial is HIV RNA suppression. We will perform economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of the engagement-retention-adherence intervention. The proposed pragmatic adaptive trial will therefore determine the minimally effective dose of counseling and the effects of a low-burden retention/adherence intervention to maintain retention in care and avoid relapse to non-adherence for AYA living with HIV. Retention in HIV care and persistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy effectively manages HIV infection, suppresses HIV replication, preserves the immune system, and reduces HIV infectiousness. Unfortunately, young people living with HIV who use alcohol and other drugs are often out of care or at risk of dropping out of HIV care. The proposed research will conduct a pragmatic adaptive clinical trial to determine the number of theory-based behavioral counseling sessions needed to engage young individuals in HIV care, and compare two text messaging interventions designed to support long-term retention in HIV care, medication adherence, and HIV viral suppression.",Unified Intervention to Impact HIV Care

"Improving Health Outcomes for Women Living with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Globally, transgender (`trans') women have 49 times higher odds of HIV infection compared to other groups and trans women living with HIV (TWH) access HIV care and adhere to medication at significantly lower rates than other at-risk groups. Poor engagement in HIV care for TWH is a result of reduced access to and avoidance of healthcare due to stigma and negative experiences with providers, and occurs in the context of social and economic marginalization that foments unstable employment and housing, familial alienation, limited social support, and substance abuse. Interventions to mitigate these barriers to care are critical to reducing HIV-related disparities and poor health outcomes for this highly vulnerable population, particularly where disparities are most apparent, including Brazil. Peer-based navigation (PN) interventions have demonstrated success in improving engagement in HIV care in low-resource settings. Our research group is currently conducting a PN intervention (`I-Care') in rural South Africa that significantly improved both linkage to care and retention for men and women. While the PN intervention addresses HIV care engagement by providing social support and skills to work with health providers and family, it requires specific adaptation and a conceptual model that addresses the unique needs of TWH identified during formative research and in consultations with Brazilian stakeholders in 2015. We propose to develop and conduct a trans-specific PN intervention in Brazil, tentatively named `TransAmigas', which integrates the I-Care approach with the Model of Gender Affirmation (GA), developed by our research team to specifically address HIV prevention and care among trans women. We will use the ADAPT-ITT methodology to develop TransAmigas, incorporating the GA model in the Brazilian context (Aim 1). We will then conduct a pilot study to test the feasibility and acceptability of TransAmigas in São Paulo, Brazil (Aim 2) by randomizing TWH to the intervention (n=100) or to clinical referral (n=50). During the nine month pilot, we will track both navigator and patient adherence to the program, recruitment needs, cohort retention, and reported satisfaction and preferences for program content through surveys at baseline and nine months. Finally, we will prepare for a multi-site efficacy trial (Aim 3) by extracting clinical data from participants' records at the referral clinic, generating preliminary efficacy data by comparing retention in HIV care and viral load by intervention arm. Clinical data will inform future trial sample size. We will implement this study in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where universal access to care and public support for gender transition care provide an enabling environment for this work to be most effective and where the team has established academic partnerships and a collaboration with the State-run reference and training clinical site (CRT), which includes trans-specific clinical services. If feasible, acceptable, and ultimately proven efficacious, TransAmigas will be the first evidence-based HIV care intervention for TWH globally – filling a crucial gap in programming. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peer Navigation (PN) that is integrated with gender affirming programming for transgender women living with HIV (TWH) could significantly improve HIV care engagement and health outcomes in this population that suffers a disproportionate burden of HIV. This study, which will be implemented in São Paulo, Brazil, aims to integrate a successful PN model with the trans-specific Model of Gender Affirmation and then pilot the intervention using a randomized design. We will determine the acceptability and feasibility of this intervention for improving health outcomes among TWH, and glean needed information to prepare for a multi-site trial. There are currently no interventions proven to increase retention in HIV care and reduce viral load for TWH; as a result, this work will fill a large gap in evidence-based continuum of care

"An HIV Retention in Care Intervention for Black MSM in Baltimore with a Job Readiness Component Project Summary  Retention in high-quality HIV care is critical for the health of people living with HIV (PLWH) as well as for reducing HIV transmission. One estimate of the HIV Continuum of Care for Black men how have sex with men (BMSM) in the US found that only 24% of BMSM are retained in care (RIC), 20% are on antiretroviral therapy, and 16% are virally suppressed. The structural factors that put men at increased risk for HIV, such as poverty, unemployment, and incarceration, also act as barriers to HIV care. The proposed project will develop and pilot test a retention in HIV care intervention for BMSM living in Baltimore that incorporates a job readiness component: Aim 1: Formative research for intervention development in practice settings One-to-one interviews with BMSM living with HIV will explore factors that facilitate engagement in care, unmet needs, and job readiness. Focus group discussions with key stakeholders will explore barriers and facilitators to implementing RIC interventions and the integration of job readiness into RIC programs. Aim 2: Develop and component test a RIC curriculum for BMSM with a job readiness component that is guided by Self-Determination Theory and an implementation science framework. Aim 3: Conduct a pilot RCT to assess feasibility and preliminary outcomes. A RCT with 50 BMSM living with HIV who are not virally suppressed will use mixed methods to assess acceptability, implementation, and limited efficacy. The primary outcome of interest will be viral suppression.  The proposed behavioral-medical intervention will be guided by Self-Determination Theory. In addition, the intervention will be developed using an implementation science framework, the Damschroer's Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, in order to promote sustainability and dissemination. This research reduces disparities in treatment outcomes in a severely underserved population of PLWH and will provide rigorous training and study in implementation science. This work is novel in that it: focuses on an underserved population, incorporates job readiness into HIV retention in care, and is guided by Self- Determination Theory. This research career development award will provide training to the recipient in the following three areas: implementation science, intervention development, and experimental design. This training will allow the recipient to achieve her career goal of conducting independent research to develop, test, and study the implementation of HIV prevention programs for underserved populations. Project Narrative Retention in HIV care is important for the health of people living with HIV as well as for reduction of HIV transmissions.

"Longitudinal impacts of neighborhood factors on HIV care continuum outcomes among Black PWID in Baltimore, MD Project summary  Key goals set forth by the National HIV/AIDS Strategy are to reduce disparities in engagement in HIV care and  HIV-­related outcomes. Black people who inject drugs have among the lowest rates of retention in HIV care and  viral suppression, and this reality during the current era of effective HIV therapy suggests additional strategies  are needed to eliminate barriers to achieving these outcomes among this population. Well-­documented  barriers to retention in HIV care and viral suppression include low income status, homelessness and  incarceration. These individual-­level barriers do not develop independent of contextual factors, including  features of neighborhoods where people reside, however. The goal of the proposed study is to identify new  targets for multilevel HIV care and treatment interventions for Black people who inject drugs by determining the  temporal impact of previously unexplored neighborhood features on retention in HIV care and viral suppression  among Black people who inject drugs, and identifying potential healthcare “resilience factors” that offset  negative impacts of exposures to hazardous neighborhood features, including those less malleable to change.  We will combine data from the longest-­running cohort of HIV-­infected Black people who have histories of

and syringe exchange programs, housing affordability, gentrification, etc.) measured at a single point in time  and cumulatively on lapses in HIV care and virologic failure among HIV-­infected Black people who inject drugs

"Technology Based Community Health Nursing to Improve cART Adherence and Virologic Suppression in Youth Living with HIV (TechN 2 CheckIN): A Regional Multi-site Study Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has disproportionately persisted as a public health threat to adolescents and young adults (AYA) from minority communities in the United States. HIV has evolved into a chronic disease, which can be managed in the outpatient setting with antiretroviral therapy (ART) designed to achieve virologic suppression and life expectancy equivalent for uninfected individuals. However, for AYA, huge disparities exist compared to adults, with greater proportions unaware of their status, lower rates of care engagement, retention, and initiation and maintenance of ART, resulting in higher rates of virologic non- suppression, and development of sequelae including immunologic deterioration and transmission. Interventions designed to improve outcomes for youth living with HIV (YLHIV) are being sponsored by agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, however, most target the early components of the continuum of care (identification, linkage, and ART initiation). Our research from the HIV Research Network shows that 30-40% of YLHIV are not virologically suppressed despite being in care, highlighting the need for novel interventions targeting the distal components of the care continuum. Community health nurse (CHN) interventions have been shown to increase access to appropriate resources, enhance health care utilization, and promote risk-reducing behavior among AYA. Use of short messaging service (SMS) messaging can further enhance clinical care by improving attendance at medical visits, medication adherence, and communication with the health care team. We have used these two modalities in randomized trials of youth with complex sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in low-income minority communities with high feasibility and acceptability amongst AYA and their families, remarkable improvements in visit completion, medication adherence, and reduction in recurrent STIs. The overarching goal of this project is to build on the evidence from this trial and to repurpose the intervention for YLHIV in the same community who are having challenges with care and medication non-adherence. We aim to compare the effectiveness of a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention (TECH-N 2 CHECK-IN) to a standard of care control group using a randomized trial design. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will result in higher rates of adherence to ART and virologic suppression. We have demonstrated our interdisciplinary team's capacity to follow urban AYA in the community, utilizing the combination of CHNs and outreach workers to optimize care according to national standards. TECH-IN 2 CHECK-IN aims to enroll 120 YLHIV followed at clinics specializing in HIV care in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan area who are challenged with treatment adherence and randomizing them to receive TECH-IN 2 CHECK-IN vs. standard of care. Results of this trial will inform best practices for engaging YLHIV by addressing the distal component of the continuum, critical to achieving the elusive 90-90-90 HIV goals.  Project Relevance Despite advances in HIV treatment, youth living with HIV (YLHIV) have profound challenges with adherence to care visits and antiretroviral therapy (ART), with 1/3 of YLHIV who are in care not reaching virologic suppression; however, few evidence-based interventions have been developed or studied that can improve these rates. We will repurpose a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention (TECH-N) with demonstrated efficacy for improving care adherence and reducing risk behaviors among youth from similar racial/ethnic, socioeconomic status and community backgrounds into an HIV-focused intervention (TECH-N 2 CHECK-IN) and use a randomized controlled trial design to compare it to standard of care for YLHIV who are non-adherent to care and ART using data on medication adherence, virologic suppression, and cost- effectiveness. If successful, this study will provide critical data to support the need for comprehensive, higher intensity community-based nursing services that leverage mHealth to assist the subset of the mostly racial/ethnic minority YLHIV who are challenged by the complexity of HIV care and to introduce a novel strategy to move the United States closer to meeting our 2020 National Health Objectives by embracing the United Nations 90-90-90 goals focused on effective treatment of YLHIV to end AIDS.",Technology Based Community Health Nursing to Improve cART Adherence and Virologic Suppression in Youth

"Influence of patient-centered HIV care on retention and viral suppression disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Achieving high rates of retention in human immunodeficiency (HIV) care and viral suppression through antiretroviral therapy not only reduces mortality, but also is a means to reduce the incidence of HIV in affected communities because viral suppression greatly decreases communicability and prevents the transmission of resistant strains of the virus. Retention in care and viral suppression have been particularly challenging for minority populations leading to racial and ethnic disparities in HIV outcomes, including survival. Among people living with HIV infection in 2013, the percentage that was virally suppressed was only 51.5% among African Americans, 58.2% among Latinos, and 65.0% among whites. Our central hypothesis is that provider patient- centered care (PCC) factors interacting with dynamic patient psychosocial factors as well as neighborhood social determinants and medical case management site factors are influencing retention in care and viral suppression and thus contributing to health disparities. The objective of this application is to identify provider PCC factors that are moderating the effect of changes in individual characteristics on retention in care and viral suppression while considering neighborhood social determinants and medical case management site factors and to predict to what extent changes in PCC factors could improve HIV care retention and viral suppression and thus reduce health disparities. We will accomplish these objectives with a cohort study of people enrolled in the Miami-Dade County Ryan White Program 2019–2021. The Ryan White Program serves 52% of people living with HIV in the United States, in particular the medically underserved. To test our central hypothesis and achieve the objectives of this application, we propose the following four specific aims: 1) Using causal Bayesian networks, assess the moderating role of HIV provider PCC factors on the association between patient-level characteristics and retention in HIV care, viral suppression, and related health disparities cross- sectionally while accounting for neighborhood-level and medical case management site factors; 2) By means of dynamic causal Bayesian networks, assess the moderating role of HIV provider PCC factors on the association between longitudinal changes in patient-level characteristics and changes in retention in HIV care, viral suppression, and related health disparities; 3) Using dynamic causal Bayesian networks, estimate the magnitude of the expected improvement in retention in HIV care, viral suppression, and related health disparities, produced by changing provider PCC factors; and 4) Identify feasibility and acceptability issues related to potential interventions to address the most influential health disparities factors identified in aims 1–3 using expert interviews and focus group discussions with RWP providers, administrators, and patients. This research thus supports one of the Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-Related Research “cross-cutting” priorities to reduce disparities in treatment outcomes. NARRATIVE To address racial/ethnic disparities in HIV care and treatment, HIV providers and the health care system need to provide optimum support to all people living with HIV infection so that they can achieve viral suppression. Viral suppression not only benefits the individual, but it also benefits the community by decreasing the number of people who can transmit HIV infection and by preventing the transmission of HIV strains that are resistant to antiviral medications. In order to guide the development of interventions to optimize HIV care and treatment delivery, this project will identify HIV provider factors that help patients remain in care, take their medications, and be virally suppressed. 1",Influence of patient-centered HIV care on retention and viral suppression disparities,9684767,R01MD012421,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Buffers ', ' Client ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' immunodeficiency ', ' immune deficiency disorder ', ' hypoimmunity ', ' Immunological Deficiency Syndromes ', ' Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Immunodeficiency Disorder ', ' Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes ', ' Incidence ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Poverty ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' County ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Case Management ', ' Latino ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Funding ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' cultural competence ', ' social ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Viral Drug Resistance ', ' resistant to antiviral ', ' resistant to anti-viral ', ' resistance to antiviral ', ' resistance to anti-viral ', ' Antiviral Drug Resistant ', ' Antiviral Drug Resistance ', ' Anti-viral Drug Resistant ', ' Anti-viral Drug Resistance ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' health literacy ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' billing data ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effective intervention ', ' resistant strain ', ' resistance strain ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' individual patient ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' Bayesian Network ', ' ']",NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,278650,0.21253727012868506
"A Mobile Health Application for Engagement in Care among Youth Living with HIV Abstract/Project Summary:  In the US, fewer than 6% of all youth living with HIV (YLWH) achieve HIV viral suppression. This health disparity extends to the entire HIV care continuum in that there is a strong association between younger age and later HIV diagnosis, lower engagement in care, lower levels of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, and worse HIV clinical outcomes. In response to this critical public health dilemma and aligned with the National Institute of Health's High Priority Topics of Research (i.e., “to reduce health disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections or in treatment outcomes of those living with HIV/AIDS”), our research team proposes to develop a novel mobile health application (“app”) to improve engagement in health care and ART adherence and to pilot test this mobile health app in 18-29 year-old YLWH. The aims of our study are to: Aim 1: Build on our theory-guided model and formative work to complete the development of our novel personalized mobile health app, WYZ (pronounced “wise”), for improved HIV clinical outcomes among YLWH. Our research team will work with the University of California, San Francisco's Information Services Unit to complete the development of WYZ using an iterative Human-Centered Design approach. This will be done by adding data integration with pharmacy and laboratory databases, creation of an Android-compatible version of the app based on our in-progress iOS version, refinement based on user-experience data from field testing, and qualitative interviews with the primary care providers of the youth participating in the field testing. Aim 2: Conduct a pilot randomized trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical impact (i.e., adherence, plasma HIV RNA, and CD4+ cell count) of the use of WYZ among YLWH and their HCPs. Aim 2 consists of two sub-aims: 2a. Examine feasibility and acceptability of the use of WYZ based on defined metrics, acceptability through qualitative exit interviews, and preliminary clinical impact by virologic/immunologic outcomes with participants randomized to the intervention versus the wait-list control. 2b. Assess the acceptability of WYZ by participants' HCPs through individual qualitative interviews.  We hypothesize that our mobile health app will be feasible and acceptable and will result in improved HIV clinical outcomes. Our study is significant because it has the potential to improve engagement in care, ART adherence, and clinical outcomes among YLWH. Our study is innovative because we will employ a novel suite of technology-based methods to improve information, motivation, and behavioral skills in YLWH. Upon completion, we will be ready to test the efficacy of this app in a subsequent large-scale RCT among this population that is disproportionately impacted by HIV and at elevated risk for poor clinical outcomes. Narrative: The research in this R34 proposal is relevant because: (1) it will complete the development of our novel personalized mobile health app for improved HIV clinical outcomes among youth living with HIV; (2) it will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical impact of the use of this app among youth living with HIV in a 12-month pilot randomized trial; and (3) it will examine the acceptability of this app by participants' healthcare providers.",A Mobile Health Application for Engagement in Care among Youth Living with HIV,9730614,R34MH114604,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Focus Groups ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Services ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' San Francisco ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' virology ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Adolescent Medicine Trials Network ', ' Adolescent Trials Network ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' health information technology ', ' population health ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' tailored health care ', ' tailored healthcare ', ' Android ', ' Mobile Health Application ', ' mHealth application ', ' mHealth app ', ' m-Health application ', ' m-Health app ', ' Mobile Health App ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R34,2019,198125,0.08180582925160193
"PROMISE - Program Refinements to Optimize Model Impact and Scalability based on Evidence Abstract  In New York, the achievement of 90-90-90 goals is jeopardized not by limited access to affordable care and treatment, but by persistent disparities in HIV viral suppression (VS). Complex behavioral and structural barriers to achieving and maintaining VS require coordinated, combination approaches to meet medical and social service needs. In 2009, at 28 Ryan White Part A (RWPA)-funded agencies, the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) launched a multi-component HIV Care Coordination Program (CCP) directed toward the most vulnerable, high-need persons living with HIV (PLWH) in NYC. A systematic CCP effectiveness study began in 2013 (R01 MH101028; PIs: Irvine, Nash). Findings to date suggest that the CCP is superior to usual care for high-need subgroups of PLWH, but there remains substantial room for improvement in short- and long-term VS. In an immediate evidence-to- practice feedback loop, the DOHMH is implementing a refined CCP model in 2018. Greater focusing, tailoring and cues for delivery of key components are expected to increase CCP engagement, reach, fidelity, scalability, effectiveness and impact. The aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Estimate the effectiveness of the revised (vs. original) CCP on timely VS (≤4 months), using experimental methods (Aim 1); 2) Estimate the effectiveness of the revised CCP (vs. `usual care') on longer-term VS, including VS at 12 months and durable viral suppression (DVS) at 24-36 months, using rigorous observational comparison group methods (Aim 2); and 3) Identify attributes and drivers of provider and client engagement in the intervention and provider and client preferences for future revised-CCP delivery and receipt (Aim 3). Prior studies have not demonstrated any intervention to be effective at improving short- and long-term VS among the many PLWH with major barriers to HIV care continuum engagement. The proposed study, to be conducted on a large scale in real-world HIV service settings, will document the rollout and effects of evidence-informed implementation course corrections to an intervention model focused on these most vulnerable PLWH. In this way, the work will advance a second generation of interventions capable of strengthening the care continuum among PLWH who have been unable to achieve desired ART outcomes in existing interventions, due to major structural or psychosocial barriers. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health  The proposed large-scale study will test the hypotheses of a revised HIV care coordination intervention's benefits over the original intervention and over `usual care,' with respect to both short-term and long-term clinical outcomes. This project brings together multiple data sources for tracking HIV care continuum completion in relation to publicly funded services, to guide HIV policymakers in New York and elsewhere in making critical decisions about program adjustments to optimize viral load suppression with limited available resources. Through a partnership including the Institute for Implementation Science and Population Health at the City University of New York, the New York City Health Department and six direct service provider agencies, findings from the proposed study will immediately be translated to HIV services planning and practice improvements, thus reducing HIV-related mortality and morbidity and preventing further HIV transmission.",PROMISE - Program Refinements to Optimize Model Impact and Scalability based on Evidence,9649255,R01MH117793,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Cities ', ' Client ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Cues ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Epidemic ', ' Evolution ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' housing instability ', ' unstably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' instably housed ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' implementation science ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' population health ', ' course implementation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Service delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' service providers ', ' Service setting ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMH,GRADUATE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH POLICY,R01,2019,617422,0.12983542059462055
"Using MOST to optimize an HIV care continuum intervention for vulnerable populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than half of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. are insufficiently engaged in HIV primary care and not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), mainly African Americans and Latinos. In the proposed project, two experienced and productive behavioral scientists will employ a potent and innovative research methodology, the Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST), to develop a highly efficacious, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum. Whereas randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are valuable for evaluating the efficacy of multi-component interventions as a package, they are not designed to evaluate which specific components contribute to efficacy. MOST, a pioneering, engineering-inspired framework, addresses this problem through highly efficient randomized experimentation to assess the performance of individual intervention components and their interactions. We propose to use MOST to engineer an intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum for African American and Latino PLHA not well engaged in care and not taking ART. Further, the intervention will be optimized for cost-effectiveness. This efficiency and cost-effectiveness are critical in a time of constrained resources, and will also increase the intervention's future scalability. NIH has signaled its interest in MOST, and this is the first study to apply it in the ield of adult HIV treatment. A similar set of multi-level factors impede both HIV care and ART initiation for African American and Latino PLHA, primary among them individual (e.g., substance use, distrust, fear), social (e.g., stigma), and structural-level barriers (e.g., difficulties accesing ancillary services). Guided by a multi-level social cognitive theory, the study will evaluate 5 distinct intervention components (i.e., Motivational Interviewing sessions, pre-adherence preparation, support groups, peer mentorship, and patient navigation), each designed to address a specific barrier to HIV care and ART initiation. These components are well-grounded in the empirical literature and were found acceptable, feasible, and promising with respect to efficacy in a preliminary study. Study aims are: 1) using a highly efficient experimental design, identify which of 5 components contribute meaningfully to improvement in viral suppression, and secondary outcomes of ART adherence and engagement in HIV primary care; 2) identify mediators and moderators of component efficacy; and 3) using a mathematical modeling approach, build the most cost-effective and efficient intervention package from the efficacious components. A heterogeneous sample of African American and Latino PLHA (with respect to age, substance use, and sexual minority status) will be recruited with a proven hybrid sampling method using targeted sampling in community settings and peer recruitment (N=512). This highly innovative and significant study, which addresses a high- priority research area (NIH NOT-OD-15-137), will produce an HIV care continuum intervention for the nation's most vulnerable PLHA, optimized for cost-effectiveness, and with exceptional levels of efficacy, efficiency, and scalability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study targets the large population of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. who are both insufficiently engaged in HIV primary care and not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), who are mainly African American/Black and Latino. NIH has emphasized the urgent need for new research approaches to advance intervention science, and the proposed project employs a new, potent, and innovative research methodology, the Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST), a framework for developing highly efficacious, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective interventions. The proposed study has the highest public health significance: it addresses a vulnerable population of PLHA, including the critically important subpopulations of men who have sex with men (MSM) and substance users; will develop an efficient and cost effective intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum for these vulnerable groups; and addresses two areas highlighted in the August 2015 notice on research priorities from the NIH Office of AIDS Research (NOT-OD-15-137) , namely, engaging PLHA in prevention/treatment services, and reducing HIV/AIDS-related racial/ethnic disparities.",Using MOST to optimize an HIV care continuum intervention for vulnerable populations,9667412,R01DA040480,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Hair ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Self Determination ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Research Priority ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Preparation ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' sexual minority ', ' intrinsic motivation ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1119602,0.19543391353938494
"Disparities in the HIV Care Continuum among Hispanics in the United States ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic has disproportionately affected the Hispanic population in the United States (US). Hispanics face the second-highest prevalence and incidence rates of HIV. Hispanics are also more likely to receive HIV care at later stages of HIV disease progression relative to any other racial or ethnic group. A complex set of unique individual- and structural-level factors confront this population and contribute to the burden of health disparities in HIV care and treatment experienced by Hispanics. In 2015, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States: Updated to 2020 (NHAS) set forth goals to reduce HIV-related disparities in high-risk populations, such as Hispanics, and to increase the proportion of individuals successfully engaged at all levels of the spectrum of HIV care and treatment. This spectrum, termed the HIV care continuum (HIVCC), has become a high-priority area for intervention. Increasing the proportions of HIV-infected individuals who progress through and ultimately reach the last stage of the HIVCC (viral suppression) has been shown to prevent over 90% of new HIV infections. To address the Hispanic population's unique HIV-related needs, it is critical to monitor trends in HIV care indicators for improvement over time and to identify the factors underlying HIV care in this population for the development of tailored public health interventions. We aim to: 1) estimate trends in the proportion of adult Hispanics that were in the last three steps of the HIVCC (retention in HIV care, prescription of antiretrovirl therapy [ART], and viral suppression) from 2004 to 2014; 2) identify demographic factors and behavioral targets for interventions to improve retention in HIV care, ART use, and viral suppression among Hispanic adults in HIV care in the US; and 3) explore the nature of progression through the last three steps of the HIVCC among adult Hispanics and identify the structural-level barriers and facilitators influencing this progression using qualitative research methods. For Aims 1 and 2, we will use data from the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD). The NA-ACCORD offers the largest-available source of longitudinal data on HIV- infected Hispanics (>15,000) in the US and has been endorsed by the Institute of Medicine as an appropriate data source for monitoring progress in NHAS goals. We will conduct qualitative in-depth interviews (N=25) with HIV-infected Hispanics in Baltimore City in Aim 3 to obtain a rich, complementary understanding of structural- level factors influencing HIVCC proportions among Hispanics. The results of this research will inform strategies designed to achieve NHAS goals to reduce health disparities and improve HIV care among Hispanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics in the United States face unique, complex challenges to HIV prevention, medical care, and treatment, demonstrating the imperative need for public health interventions that are specifically tailored to this important population. The results of the proposed research will provide a strong basis with which to inform interventions designed to reduce persistent HIV-related health disparities by increasing the proportion of Hispanics that are retained in HIV clinical care, are prescribed antiretroviral therapy, and ultimately achieve HIV viral suppression. Increased rates of viral suppression among Hispanics will, in turn, contribute to reduced HIV transmission and improved HIV-related health outcomes in this population.",Disparities in the HIV Care Continuum among Hispanics in the United States,9720794,F31AI124794,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Baltimore ', ' Cities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Persons ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' virology ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nature ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Viral ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Population Attributable Risks ', ' attributable fraction ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' time use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' public health intervention ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,9711,0.24263908330845893
"Youth Services Navigation Intervention for HIV+ adolescents and young adults being released from incarceration: A randomized control trial Project Summary/Abstract The continuum of HIV care has forced new focus on the urgency to identify and effectively serve high-need, under-resourced, and often transient populations to facilitate their receiving the necessary ongoing care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress HIV RNA viral load (VL). Crucial target groups for improving care along the continuum are young (aged 16-25), sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations being released from jail settings. HIV prevalence among incarcerated youth living with HIV (YLWH) is three times that of the general population and one in seven of all HIV+ persons experience incarceration each year. HIV incidence, prevalence, and incarceration rates are higher for blacks and Latinos than for any other group – these disparities are especially prominent among youth. Furthermore, only an estimated 6% of HIV+ youth are virally suppressed, due to poor retention and adherence to ART. Existing linkage and retention services are insufficient to meet the acute needs of criminal justice-involved (CJI) HIV+ youth, particularly in the high-need period following release from incarceration. Moreover, because of their lack of experience, many youths may struggle to obtain needed services and stabilize their living conditions. Disparities in HIV continuum outcomes are inextricably linked to incarceration, substance use disorders (SUDs), homelessness, and mental health (MH) problems among YLWH. If HIV is to be controlled and the benefits of ART experienced broadly, the problems of CJI YLWH must be addressed with innovative, youth-, and sexual and gender minority (SGM)- sensitive approaches. We propose to enroll 240 CJI YLWH, aged 16-25, incarcerated in Los Angeles and Chicago jails and juvenile detention facilities. We will randomize participants to the YSN intervention (n=120) vs. a usual-care control group (n=120). The youth services navigators (YSNs) will assist with addressing immediate unmet needs such as housing, transportation, and food prior to clinical care and ongoing; will guide intervention participants to a range of community services to support progress along the continuum of HIV care; and will provide direct ART adherence support. The proposed study has two Primary Specific Aims: 1. Adapt an existing peer navigation intervention for adults to create a Youth Service Navigation (YSN) intervention sensitive to SGM culture that guides youth to needed services along the continuum of HIV care. This intervention combines medical, substance use and mental health care with comprehensive reentry support for CJI YLWH, aged 16-25 upon release from large county jails and juvenile detention systems; 2. Using a two-group RCT design, we will test the effectiveness of the new YSN, youth SGM-sensitive intervention among CJI YLWH aged 16-25, compared to controls offered standard referrals to services. We will evaluate the YSN Intervention's effect on post-incarceration linkage, retention, adherence, and viral suppression, as well as on SUDs, mental health, services utilization, and met needs. Secondary Aims: We will assess YSN's effects on recidivism, costs and potential cost-offset/effectiveness.   Public Health Relevance Crucial target groups for improving care along the Continuum of Care are young (aged 16-25) HIV+ sexual and gender minority youths with criminal-justice involvement (CJI) – a population that is poorly retained in HIV care. If HIV is to be controlled and the benefits of ART advances experienced broadly, the problems of CJI young people living with HIV must be addressed with innovative, youth-, and sexual and gender minority-sensitive approaches. The proposed Youth Services Navigation intervention will address this gap, testing a youth- focused approach that is adapted from our successful intervention with HIV+ CJI adults.",Youth Services Navigation Intervention for HIV+ adolescents and young adults being released from incarceration: A randomized control trial,9745320,R01MD011773,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Chicago ', ' Community Health Services ', ' Community Services ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Housing ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Los Angeles ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Persons ', ' Probability ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' virus RNA ', ' viral RNA ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Shelter facility ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Homelessness ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Gays ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' recidivism ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' contingency management ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' community reentry ', ' community re-entry ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' successful intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' trial design ', ' navigator intervention ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' usual care arm ', ' usual care control group ', ' intervention participants ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,710607,0.09846469205675178
"Risk and Resiliency among Vulnerable PLWHIV in Post-Hurricane Puerto Rico ABSTRACT In September 2017, the Caribbean region and southern United States was hit by four hurricanes (Irma, Harvey, Maria, and Nate), resulting in widespread and severe damage to infrastructure and ongoing disruption of social and economic systems throughout the region, including Puerto Rico. While the immediate and ongoing impact on public health has yet to be fully assessed, it may be expected that the it may also have serious consequences for a wide range of health outcomes, exacerbating pre-hurricane health disparities and placing even greater pressure on an already under-resourced health services infrastructure. Of particular concern in this application is the impact of the 2017 hurricanes on the large population of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) in Puerto Rico, including substantial proportions of vulnerable groups of women, men who have sex with men, and injection drug users. HIV testing rates among high-risk populations in PR have remained low throughout the HIV epidemic, as is engagement in HIV care, both of which contribute to increased secondary transmission. Late detection has inevitably contributed to late enrollment in care. Most PLWHIV in PR enter care with already serious compromised immune response, making them more vulnerable to HIV-related opportunistic infections and associated morbidity. Indeed PR has one of the highest HIV death rates in the US (roughly four times higher than the national average). Prior research on natural disasters of a similar in severity and scope, such as Hurricane Katrina, for example, showed that there was a significant impact on mental health (e.g., stress, trauma, etc.) and that combined external factors related to the accessibility of HIV care, resulted in significant changes in clinical HIV status. Positioned as a preliminary, R21 level initiative, we propose an exploratory study to assess whether there have been significant post-hurricane changes in clinical HIV status among PLWHIV in PR, and if so, what factors predict those changes. This application builds upon a well-established collaboration between HIV researchers in the School of Public Health at the University of Puerto Rico and Centro Latinoamericano de Enfermedades de Transmisión Sexual (CLETS), the largest HIV treatment center in PR. The ongoing CORE study within the CLETS clinic population provides a strategic opportunity to examine the impact of the 2017 hurricanes on clinical outcomes among PLWHIV in PR. We will adapt the CORE survey instruments to capture additional data related to post-hurricane behavioral risks, mental health status, and help-seeking and recover both pre-hurricane and post-hurricane clinical data for each study participant using a Targeted Chart Review process. We will examine the clinical data for three months prior to the hurricane and compare it with post-hurricane clinical data to assess whether there have been significant post-hurricane changes in HIV clinical status (CD4, viral load, OIs, etc.) among the PLWHIV, using data from the CORE survey to identify predictors of those changes. For example, post-hurricane gaps in the availability of HIV care, increased mental health distress (e.g., PTSD, anxiety, depression), and increased behavioral risk (notably in substance use) may individually and collectively have contributed to gaps in adherence. Failure to maintain viral suppression may have negative consequences for the health status of individual PLWHIV and may also amplify secondary transmission. The proposed study may inform ongoing efforts to restore critical health services for PLWHIV and inform future research in this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE In September 2017, the Caribbean region and southern U.S. was hit by four hurricanes (Irma, Harvey, Maria, and Nate), significantly impacting island populations in the region, including Puerto Rico.

"LetSync: An mHealth approach to HIV care engagement among black men in couples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Based on current diagnoses rates, one in two Black men-who-have-sex-with-men (BMSM) will be diagnosed with HIV during their lifetime. Interventions to optimize retention in care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among BMSM are urgently needed to reduce HIV racial disparities. Dyadic intervention approaches are promising, given that nearly half of BMSM living with HIV are in primary relationships, and are consistent with calls for research with BMSM to focus beyond the individual level. Our preliminary research with BMSM in couples finds that the primary relationship is often the main resource in meeting needs in HIV care engagement. BMSM couples engage in joint problem-solving and dyadic coordination of care that entail synchronizing and co-organizing schedules, activities, and behaviors around treatment and care. We also found that dyadic coordination and joint problem-solving in care engagement may be more common among BMSM couples with greater couple’s resilience, defined as the couple’s capacity to overcome shared adversity that buffers against the strains of social and structural factors on health and wellbeing for BMSM. Based on our preliminary work and extant research, we developed a theoretical Framework of Dyadic HIV Care Engagement to guide this research. Smartphones are ubiquitous among BMSM of various ages and socioeconomic backgrounds, and mobile technology for health (mHealth) is feasible, acceptable, and effective as HIV interventions among BMSM. We have developed initial designs for a BMSM-couple-focused intervention application (app), LetSync, to improve retention in care and ART adherence. BMSM couples showed a great interest in this approach. However, critical issues remain, such as the need for a deeper understanding of how dyadic processes interrelate to bolster dyadic capacity, how they may be targeted in an mHealth intervention, and the need for piloting intervention components and features. As such, the aims to this R01 are as follows. Aim 1 will involve investigating interrelated dyadic processes in HIV care engagement (couple’s resilience, joint problem-solving, dyadic coordination) through in-depth interviews with BMSM in 12 seroconcordant-positive and 12 serodiscordant couples (24 couples, N=48) guided by our conceptual framework. Aim 2 will develop a couple’s mHealth intervention informed by Aim 1 and our prior mHealth designs, through iterative app development with a community advisory council of BMSM couples and a mini-pilot of the app prototype, intervention protocols, and procedures. Aim 3 will entail a randomized, waitlist-controlled pilot trial with 80 couples (N=160) to assess its acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary impact on retention in care and ART adherence as measured by antiretroviral concentrations in hair. Findings from the proposed research are critical for informing a subsequent full-scale RCT to test the efficacy of LetSync in improving HIV care and treatment outcomes among BMSM couples toward reducing HIV racial disparities in the U.S. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventions to optimize HIV care engagement among Black men-who-have-sex-with-men are critically needed to reduce HIV racial disparities. Intervention approaches for targeting couples are promising. The proposed research will significantly contribute knowledge gained from the development of a couple-focused mHealth HIV intervention for a key population disproportionately impacted by HIV.",LetSync: An mHealth approach to HIV care engagement among black men in couples,9781285,R01MH118967,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Couples ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' virusemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' viraemia ', ' Viremia ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Sampling ', ' protocol development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' pilot trial ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' prototype ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,713761,0.24054512338449413
"Neighborhoods, Networks, and the HIV Care Continuum among HIV-infected MSM in NYC Abstract  Marked disparities by race/ethnicity exist in HIV infection rates and engagement and retention in care among men who have sex with men (MSM) along the HIV care continuum. Compared with White MSM, HIV- infected Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM are less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART), adhere to ART, and achieve viral suppression. Lower rates of care engagement and retention among Black and Latino MSM are influenced by factors beyond the individual. In order to uncover the neighborhood- and network-involved pathways that produce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV care outcomes, yielding an empirical basis for interventions and policies to fill gaps in the care continuum among Black and Latino MSM, systematic, theory- based investigation of the specific and intersecting neighborhood and network characteristics that relate to retention in care, ART adherence, and viral suppression must be engaged.  Using socioecological and intersectional conceptual frameworks, several mid-range and micro social and psychological theories, and informed by our NIH/NIMH R56-funded formative research, we propose to identify neighborhood-and network-level characteristics associated with HIV care continuum outcomes (viral suppression, retention in care, and ART adherence) among 550 HIV-infected MSM living in New York City (NYC) via a longitudinal study. We will investigate the influence of neighborhood composition and four neighborhood-level characteristics domains, testing theoretical pathways of influence across the different neighborhoods in which MSM live, socialize, and receive HIV care.  The Specific Aims are, among HIV-infected MSM in NYC: Aim 1: To use spatial analysis to characterize clustering and spatial trends in HIV care outcomes. Aim 2: To examine HIV care outcomes by race/ethnicity in relationship to longitudinal changes in: 2a) Exposure to neighborhoods of potential influence (home; social; health facility access); 2b) Neighborhood characteristics conceptual domains (community violence/physical disorder/social disorganization; AOD use factors; social norms; community resources); 2c) Social networks. Aim 3: To use multilevel modeling to assess associations among changes over time in exposure to the neighborhood characteristics and changes in social networks with HIV care outcomes by race/ethnicity, while assessing the potential mediating and moderating effects of individual- and network-level factors.  The study will employ an innovative approach combining geospatial mapping of neighborhoods with multilevel modeling, spatial statistics, and an existing, extensive geospatial database. It will have direct implications for the design of multilevel interventions, addressing factors at the neighborhood-, network-, and individual-levels, to improve HIV care outcomes for MSM, particularly for Black and Latino MSM. Project Narrative The study purpose is to examine the neighborhoods in which HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City live, socialize, and get HIV medical care and the structure and make-up of social networks (connections between friends, family members, etc.) over time, and to assess the relationship of these characteristics to achieving undetectable HIV viral load, being retained in HIV care, and adhering to HIV drugs. The study will also examine how these factors differ by race/ethnicity. This study will have direct impact on the design of programs to improve HIV care among MSM, particularly for Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM.","Neighborhoods, Networks, and the HIV Care Continuum among HIV-infected MSM in NYC",9780778,R01MH118960,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Award ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Facility Accesses ', ' Health ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Housing ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Overdose ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Disorganizations ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Socialization ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Family member ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' urban planning ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Investigation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Conceptual Domain ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Homophobia ', ' Homophobic ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Green space ', ' greenspace ', ' intersectionality ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' social deficits ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social disorders ', ' social defects ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER,R01,2019,843949,0.08156488179816992
"Identifying and Engaging Urban HIV infected and uninfected YBMSM in care Project Summary The U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy 2020 calls for increasing access to care and improving outcomes of people living with HIV and targeting biomedical prevention efforts (including access to pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) where HIV is most heavily concentrated. Baltimore, MD; Washington, DC; and Philadelphia, PA (BWP) are disproportionately burdened by high rates of new cases of HIV infection, with disproportionate rates in young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) aged 15 to 24. High incidence underscores the need for increased identification, linkage and initiation in HIV and preventive care for YBMSM. Grants focused on high rates directly address NIH research priorities to reduce health disparities in the incidence of HI, in ART outcomes or in high HIV prevalent or high-risk areas. This innovative proposal seeks to test, treat and retain YBMSM living in BWP along the prevention and treatment continuums using the following aims: Aim 1. Identify and recruit young (ages 15-24) black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) in 3 urban cities who are (1) HIV-infected, not virally suppressed; and (2) high-risk HIV uninfected YBMSM, including gender variant and questioning men, using respondent driven sampling with targeted seed identification; Aim 2. Compare the efficacy of two study arms (mobile-enhanced engagement intervention (MEI) vs. standard of care (SOC)) to achieve sustained retention (measured by ≥ 4 follow up visits per 18 months) and engagement in HIV care (measured by durable viral suppression (HIV VL < 200 copies/ml) and substance treatment among 300 HIV infected YBMSM who are not virally suppressed and recruited from RDS; and Aim 3. Modify and implement mobile-enhanced intervention for 300 high-risk HIV uninfected YBMSM, recruited from RDS to promote linkage, retention and engagement of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and substance treatment uptake over 12 months, comparing younger (15-19) and older (20-24) participants. The mobile-enhanced engagement intervention is driven by the expressed and self-determined needs of each HIV infected and uninfected participant and includes care navigation, engagement, treatment and adherence, with a supplemental SBIRT+ intervention, to support YBMSM who face barriers accessing substance use treatment. By building upon existing case management services and flexibility to be adapted across ages and maturity and for prevention services, this intervention has the ability to transform networks, HIV and prevention care in YBMSM in cities with very high primary and secondary HIV transmission. Project Narrative This 3-city proposal seeks to address disparities of HIV in YBMSM in a multilevel intervention to identify, link retain and engage, high-risk uninfected and HIV infected urban YBMSM in prevention and treatment cascade. The mobile-enhanced engagement intervention is driven by the expressed and self-determined needs of each HIV infected and uninfected participant and includes care navigation, engagement, treatment and adherence, with a supplemental SBIRT+ intervention, to support YBMSM who face barriers accessing substance use treatment.

"Technology Based Community Health Nursing to Improve cART Adherence and Virologic Suppression in Youth Living with HIV (TechN 2 CheckIN): A Regional Multi-site Study Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has disproportionately persisted as a public health threat to adolescents and young adults (AYA) from minority communities in the United States. HIV has evolved into a chronic disease, which can be managed in the outpatient setting with antiretroviral therapy (ART) designed to achieve virologic suppression and life expectancy equivalent for uninfected individuals. However, for AYA, huge disparities exist compared to adults, with greater proportions unaware of their status, lower rates of care engagement, retention, and initiation and maintenance of ART, resulting in higher rates of virologic non- suppression, and development of sequelae including immunologic deterioration and transmission. Interventions designed to improve outcomes for youth living with HIV (YLHIV) are being sponsored by agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, however, most target the early components of the continuum of care (identification, linkage, and ART initiation). Our research from the HIV Research Network shows that 30-40% of YLHIV are not virologically suppressed despite being in care, highlighting the need for novel interventions targeting the distal components of the care continuum. Community health nurse (CHN) interventions have been shown to increase access to appropriate resources, enhance health care utilization, and promote risk-reducing behavior among AYA. Use of short messaging service (SMS) messaging can further enhance clinical care by improving attendance at medical visits, medication adherence, and communication with the health care team. We have used these two modalities in randomized trials of youth with complex sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in low-income minority communities with high feasibility and acceptability amongst AYA and their families, remarkable improvements in visit completion, medication adherence, and reduction in recurrent STIs. The overarching goal of this project is to build on the evidence from this trial and to repurpose the intervention for YLHIV in the same community who are having challenges with care and medication non-adherence. We aim to compare the effectiveness of a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention (TECH-N 2 CHECK-IN) to a standard of care control group using a randomized trial design. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will result in higher rates of adherence to ART and virologic suppression. We have demonstrated our interdisciplinary team's capacity to follow urban AYA in the community, utilizing the combination of CHNs and outreach workers to optimize care according to national standards. TECH-IN 2 CHECK-IN aims to enroll 120 YLHIV followed at clinics specializing in HIV care in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan area who are challenged with treatment adherence and randomizing them to receive TECH-IN 2 CHECK-IN vs. standard of care. Results of this trial will inform best practices for engaging YLHIV by addressing the distal component of the continuum, critical to achieving the elusive 90-90-90 HIV goals.  Project Relevance Despite advances in HIV treatment, youth living with HIV (YLHIV) have profound challenges with adherence to care visits and antiretroviral therapy (ART), with 1/3 of YLHIV who are in care not reaching virologic suppression; however, few evidence-based interventions have been developed or studied that can improve these rates. We will repurpose a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention (TECH-N) with demonstrated efficacy for improving care adherence and reducing risk behaviors among youth from similar racial/ethnic, socioeconomic status and community backgrounds into an HIV-focused intervention (TECH-N 2 CHECK-IN) and use a randomized controlled trial design to compare it to standard of care for YLHIV who are non-adherent to care and ART using data on medication adherence, virologic suppression, and cost- effectiveness. If successful, this study will provide critical data to support the need for comprehensive, higher intensity community-based nursing services that leverage mHealth to assist the subset of the mostly racial/ethnic minority YLHIV who are challenged by the complexity of HIV care and to introduce a novel strategy to move the United States closer to meeting our 2020 National Health Objectives by embracing the United Nations 90-90-90 goals focused on effective treatment of YLHIV to end AIDS.",Technology Based Community Health Nursing to Improve cART Adherence and Virologic Suppression in Youth

"Using MOST to optimize an HIV care continuum intervention for vulnerable populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than half of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. are insufficiently engaged in HIV primary care and not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), mainly African Americans and Latinos. In the proposed project, two experienced and productive behavioral scientists will employ a potent and innovative research methodology, the Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST), to develop a highly efficacious, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum. Whereas randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are valuable for evaluating the efficacy of multi-component interventions as a package, they are not designed to evaluate which specific components contribute to efficacy. MOST, a pioneering, engineering-inspired framework, addresses this problem through highly efficient randomized experimentation to assess the performance of individual intervention components and their interactions. We propose to use MOST to engineer an intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum for African American and Latino PLHA not well engaged in care and not taking ART. Further, the intervention will be optimized for cost-effectiveness. This efficiency and cost-effectiveness are critical in a time of constrained resources, and will also increase the intervention's future scalability. NIH has signaled its interest in MOST, and this is the first study to apply it in the ield of adult HIV treatment. A similar set of multi-level factors impede both HIV care and ART initiation for African American and Latino PLHA, primary among them individual (e.g., substance use, distrust, fear), social (e.g., stigma), and structural-level barriers (e.g., difficulties accesing ancillary services). Guided by a multi-level social cognitive theory, the study will evaluate 5 distinct intervention components (i.e., Motivational Interviewing sessions, pre-adherence preparation, support groups, peer mentorship, and patient navigation), each designed to address a specific barrier to HIV care and ART initiation. These components are well-grounded in the empirical literature and were found acceptable, feasible, and promising with respect to efficacy in a preliminary study. Study aims are: 1) using a highly efficient experimental design, identify which of 5 components contribute meaningfully to improvement in viral suppression, and secondary outcomes of ART adherence and engagement in HIV primary care; 2) identify mediators and moderators of component efficacy; and 3) using a mathematical modeling approach, build the most cost-effective and efficient intervention package from the efficacious components. A heterogeneous sample of African American and Latino PLHA (with respect to age, substance use, and sexual minority status) will be recruited with a proven hybrid sampling method using targeted sampling in community settings and peer recruitment (N=512). This highly innovative and significant study, which addresses a high- priority research area (NIH NOT-OD-15-137), will produce an HIV care continuum intervention for the nation's most vulnerable PLHA, optimized for cost-effectiveness, and with exceptional levels of efficacy, efficiency, and scalability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study targets the large population of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in the U.S. who are both insufficiently engaged in HIV primary care and not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), who are mainly African American/Black and Latino. NIH has emphasized the urgent need for new research approaches to advance intervention science, and the proposed project employs a new, potent, and innovative research methodology, the Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST), a framework for developing highly efficacious, efficient, scalable, and cost-effective interventions. The proposed study has the highest public health significance: it addresses a vulnerable population of PLHA, including the critically important subpopulations of men who have sex with men (MSM) and substance users; will develop an efficient and cost effective intervention to increase engagement along the HIV care continuum for these vulnerable groups; and addresses two areas highlighted in the August 2015 notice on research priorities from the NIH Office of AIDS Research (NOT-OD-15-137) , namely, engaging PLHA in prevention/treatment services, and reducing HIV/AIDS-related racial/ethnic disparities.",Using MOST to optimize an HIV care continuum intervention for vulnerable populations,9888341,R01DA040480,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Hair ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Self Determination ', ' Support Groups ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad resin ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Research Priority ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Preparation ', ' Behavioral ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' sexual minority ', ' intrinsic motivation ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' multiphase optimization strategy ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,762512,0.19543391353938494
"Unified Intervention to Impact HIV Care Continuum This pragmatic adaptive clinical trial will test the effects of a Stigma-Motivational-Decision intervention designed to increase HIV treatment engagement, retention, and medication adherence for substance using adolescents and young adults (AYA) living with HIV who are not in clinical care. The intervention uses a uniquely unified counseling approach at multiple points along the HIV continuum of care. In a first step, we will use multiple modes of outreach including social media, passive media, clinic records, and chain referrals to seek and identify HIV positive AYA (age 16 to 25) who are out of HIV care. In Step 2, HIV positive AYA who are out of HIV care and substance using will be enrolled in a phone-delivered counseling intervention to address substance use, HIV stigmas, medical care-related concerns, structural barriers, and other challenges to engaging youth in HIV care. Counseling will be provided weekly until the time participants are engaged in care, with a maximum of 12 sessions (up 3-months). We will therefore determine the number of theory-based phone intervention sessions needed (minimally effective dose) for care engagement and the associated costs. Once engaged in care, Step 3 will conduct a randomized trial to test the comparative effects and cost effectiveness of interactive text messaging with opportunities for ongoing supportive problem solving versus text message reminders to sustain long-term retention in care and medication adherence. HIV positive AYA are likely to drop out of care because of known challenges such as substance use, social barriers such as stigma, and concerns regarding treatment. Our 3-step study will use a single theory-based approach to determine the number of phone-delivered Stigma-Motivational-Decision counseling intervention sessions necessary to achieve engagement or re-engagement in HIV care, and will test the effects of a low-cost approach to sustaining long-term retention in care and medication adherence. Participants will be out of care at baseline and counseled with up to 12 weekly phone-delivered intervention sessions until they confirm engagement in HIV care. The study will determine the minimally effective counseling dose needed to engage substance using HIV positive AYA in care. Once participants attend HIV medical appointments, they will be randomized to either: (a) 15-months of ongoing weekly mobile phone text message check-ins with the opportunity for brief problem-focused phone support or (b) weekly text message reminders. The study will test the effects of the counseling and text messaging interventions on maintaining HIV care retention, medication adherence, and HIV viral suppression over 18-months. The primary endpoint in this trial is HIV RNA suppression. We will perform economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of the engagement-retention-adherence intervention. The proposed pragmatic adaptive trial will therefore determine the minimally effective dose of counseling and the effects of a low-burden retention/adherence intervention to maintain retention in care and avoid relapse to non-adherence for AYA living with HIV. Retention in HIV care and persistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy effectively manages HIV infection, suppresses HIV replication, preserves the immune system, and reduces HIV infectiousness. Unfortunately, young people living with HIV who use alcohol and other drugs are often out of care or at risk of dropping out of HIV care. The proposed research will conduct a pragmatic adaptive clinical trial to determine the number of theory-based behavioral counseling sessions needed to engage young individuals in HIV care, and compare two text messaging interventions designed to support long-term retention in HIV care, medication adherence, and HIV viral suppression.",Unified Intervention to Impact HIV Care

"Continuous Traumatic Violence and the HIV Continuum of Care Outcomes Among BMSM Project Summary The goals of this project are to (1) examine how exposures to continuous traumatic violence are related to engagement and retention in HIV care; (2) illuminate the pathways through which violence exposures affect HIV engagement and retention to care; and (3) identify factors that promote resilience among people living with HIV who have been exposed to violence. Continuous traumatic violence is conceptualized as chronic violence exposure, continuous danger, or ongoing threats that can manifest as structural, economic, psychological, interpersonal and social violence. This study examines continuous traumatic violence as inclusive of community and police violence, intimate partner violence, race- and sexuality-based stigma and discrimination, and the lingering effects of childhood sexual abuse, and explore these types of violence through the syndemic framework. Each of these various dimensions of violence disproportionately affects Black males, including YBMSM and a syndemic approach to continuous traumatic violence itself, may, therefore, better explain disparities in HIV care outcomes. Experiences of violence have been identified as an important aspect of syndemics that significantly contribute to lower engagement in HIV care and lower rates of viral suppression among Black MSM. Yet, much like multiple syndemic conditions contribute to disparities in HIV risk and outcomes, the experience of violence is not monolithic. Various types of violence exposures may cluster to have negative interactive effects on HIV care outcomes. This study will promote a deeper understanding of how these multiple dimensions of violence may have an additive and interactive correlation to poor engagement and retention in HIV care of YBMSM, despite significant outreach and retention efforts. This study focuses on YBMSM, a high priority population with regard to improving HIV outcomes. We will test an empirically informed conceptual model describing mediating and moderating factors that link continuous traumatic violence exposure to HIV care cascade outcomes. This model is based on our two decades of focused research on how violence impacts HIV risks and health outcomes among Black youth and young adults and BMSM. Documenting significant correlations among various dimensions of violence across a single sample of YBMSM is a necessary first step before developing costly longitudinal studies and interventions. Study results will inform a trauma-informed R34 application for HIV positive YBMSM. Project Narrative HIV infection and poor engagement and retention in care continue to be an ongoing public health crisis among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). This population is also disproportionately affected by the prevalence of various forms of violence that have been shown to have widespread effects on public health. This research will examine the interplay between these two intersecting public health concerns and has the potential to prolong the quality of life for YBMSM by identifying the pathways through which experience of violence contributes to disparities in HIV treatment outcomes.",Continuous Traumatic Violence and the HIV Continuum of Care Outcomes Among BMSM,9913255,R21MH122010,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Chicago ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' Child Sexual Molestation ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Interview ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexuality ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Police ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' sex abuse ', ' sexually abused ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' physical abuse ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Trauma ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' AAMSM ', ' African American MSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' BMSM ', ' black MSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' protective factors ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' early adversity ', ' early childhood adversity ', ' early life adversity ', ' ']",NIMH,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2020,214605,0.06181795298494522
"The Role of an Artificially Intelligent Chatbot in Social Support, Antiretroviral Adherence, and Depressive Symptoms among Young Adults Living with HIV in South Africa PROJECT SUMMARY Specific Aims: Developing effective interventions to reduce disparities in treatment outcomes among populations disproportionately affected by HIV is a priority for NIH-funded HIV research in 2019. This study will explore the effects and uptake of an artificially intelligent, socially supportive chatbot – a computer that texts with users via mobile phone – among young women and men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV in South Africa. Specifically, the study will (1) develop an online scale to measure social support from a chatbot among young adults; (2) evaluate associations of social support from a chatbot with changes in depressive symptoms and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among young women and YMSM in South Africa; and (3) describe barriers and facilitators to uptake of a chatbot among young women and YMSM in South Africa. Significance: Young South Africans between the ages of 15 to 24 are at high risk of contracting and dying from HIV. Though ART extends life and prevents transmission, many young adults have poor adherence. Research in high-income countries suggest that automated two-way messaging with chatbots improves adherence to health behaviors. Chatbots may also address depressive symptoms and lack of social support, which are consistently identified barriers to adherence. Chatbots are rarely used to improve HIV care in low- and middle-income countries. If this study’s aims are achieved, then (1) future researchers will be able to more accurately measure social support from chatbots; (2) chatbots could potentially be used to promote adherence to medications and increase access to mental health support; and (3) future design and implementation of chatbots to improve HIV care will be optimized. This study’s long-term objective is to generate evidence for an effective, scalable intervention that engages hard-to-reach populations living with HIV. Approach: Aim 1 will develop a scale to measure social support from a chatbot using principal components and exploratory factor analyses applied to data gathered from 1,200 young adults worldwide who use Replika, a freely available mobile application (app). Aims 2 and 3 will invite 160 young women and YMSM living with HIV in Cape Town, South Africa to use the Replika app for four weeks in a pre-post study design. Aim 2 will employ an analysis of covariance using generalized multivariable linear regression models to assess the relationship between feelings of social support from the Replika app and changes in depressive symptoms and ART adherence. Aim 3 will leverage surveys (quantitative) and interviews (qualitative) in a mixed methods study to characterize differences between users with high- and low-frequency engagement with the app. Fellowship Information: This study is the dissertation for Ms. Brooke Jarrett, a PhD student in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University. Her training will consist of research methods and science communication toward her career goal of becoming a researcher of state-of-the-art mobile technologies to improve the physical and mental health of young people affected by health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Though medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can greatly increase life expectancy and prevent new HIV infections, many young adults living with HIV do not adhere to their prescribed daily regimen of medications. Artificially intelligent chatbots – or a computer that texts back-and-forth with users – may be able to promote adherence to health behaviors. This study will explore whether and how chatbots can provide social support, alleviate depressive symptoms, and improve medication adherence among young women and men who have sex with men living with HIV in South Africa.","The Role of an Artificially Intelligent Chatbot in Social Support, Antiretroviral Adherence, and Depressive Symptoms among Young Adults Living with HIV in South Africa",9925884,F31MH121128,"['Affect ', ' Southern Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Fellowship ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' South Africa ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' social norm ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Life ', ' posters ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' innovative technologies ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' Regimen ', ' adolescent woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' young woman ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"An HIV Retention in Care Intervention for Black MSM in Baltimore with a Job Readiness Component Project Summary  Retention in high-quality HIV care is critical for the health of people living with HIV (PLWH) as well as for reducing HIV transmission. One estimate of the HIV Continuum of Care for Black men how have sex with men (BMSM) in the US found that only 24% of BMSM are retained in care (RIC), 20% are on antiretroviral therapy, and 16% are virally suppressed. The structural factors that put men at increased risk for HIV, such as poverty, unemployment, and incarceration, also act as barriers to HIV care. The proposed project will develop and pilot test a retention in HIV care intervention for BMSM living in Baltimore that incorporates a job readiness component: Aim 1: Formative research for intervention development in practice settings One-to-one interviews with BMSM living with HIV will explore factors that facilitate engagement in care, unmet needs, and job readiness. Focus group discussions with key stakeholders will explore barriers and facilitators to implementing RIC interventions and the integration of job readiness into RIC programs. Aim 2: Develop and component test a RIC curriculum for BMSM with a job readiness component that is guided by Self-Determination Theory and an implementation science framework. Aim 3: Conduct a pilot RCT to assess feasibility and preliminary outcomes. A RCT with 50 BMSM living with HIV who are not virally suppressed will use mixed methods to assess acceptability, implementation, and limited efficacy. The primary outcome of interest will be viral suppression.  The proposed behavioral-medical intervention will be guided by Self-Determination Theory. In addition, the intervention will be developed using an implementation science framework, the Damschroer's Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, in order to promote sustainability and dissemination. This research reduces disparities in treatment outcomes in a severely underserved population of PLWH and will provide rigorous training and study in implementation science. This work is novel in that it: focuses on an underserved population, incorporates job readiness into HIV retention in care, and is guided by Self- Determination Theory. This research career development award will provide training to the recipient in the following three areas: implementation science, intervention development, and experimental design. This training will allow the recipient to achieve her career goal of conducting independent research to develop, test, and study the implementation of HIV prevention programs for underserved populations. Project Narrative Retention in HIV care is important for the health of people living with HIV as well as for reduction of HIV transmissions.

"Pragmatic Efficacy Trial of mHealth to Improve HIV Outcomes in the DC Cohort In order to achieve the end of the HIV epidemic, concerted efforts will be needed to address the HIV care continuum, including improving retention in care and viral suppression among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Currently, in the U.S., it is estimated that less than 50% of PLWH are retained in care and even fewer are virally suppressed. Studies have shown that these PLWH have poorer clinical outcomes and are at risk of transmitting HIV to others, hence the need for innovative solutions to improve retention in care and subsequent viral suppression. Theory-based mHealth interventions have been shown to be promising in reaching these at- risk groups and improving HIV-related outcomes. PositiveLinks is a clinic-deployed mHealth platform that includes patient and provider smartphone apps, a web portal for clinic staff and providers to manage patient cohorts, an online implementation guide, and a learning management system to train and certify clinic staff. It has theory-based features including daily queries of adherence, mood, and stress, graphical feedback for self- monitoring, secure messaging with staff, appointment reminders, anonymized peer support, information resources, and document upload capability to support insurance re-enrollment. A 12-month prospective study in poorly retained adults with HIV found that PL increased RIC and VS, with app usage related to benefit as well as improved social support and stigma. PL is a promising existing mHealth tool for PLWH, but its efficacy has not been tested in a rigorous randomized trial, nor in urban populations. We propose to test the efficacy of PositiveLinks to improve retention in care and viral suppression among a cohort of PLWH in a high HIV prevalence city of Washington, DC. Participants will be identified from the DC Cohort, a longitudinal observational prospective cohort of PLWH receiving HIV care at 14 clinical sites in Washington, DC. First, we will conduct formative research to assess the feasibility, acceptability and usability of PositiveLinks among this urban cohort and conduct subsequent adaptations based on these findings. We will then conduct an efficacy study through a cluster randomized controlled trial at 14 DC Cohort sites among 560 PLWH. Clinics will be randomized to PL or usual care. Our primary outcomes will include viral suppression, retention in care and visit constancy at 12 months. Finally, we will conduct mixed methods implementation science research guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and RE-AIM to identify site, patient, provider, and system factors that characterize best practices in program implementation. If successful, this research will lead to the development of a novel and efficacious approach to improving retention in care and viral suppression among PLWH which could lead to next-generation dissemination research that will contribute to HIV epidemic control. This project is responsive to NIH priorities, National HIV/AIDS Strategy, and Ending the HIV Epidemic goals as it is cross-cutting, seeks to reduce health inequities, and to improve health outcomes to achieve sustained viral suppression in a geographic hotspot for HIV. Project Narrative This project seeks to test the efficacy of a theory-based mHealth intervention, PositiveLinks (PL) to improve retention in care and viral suppression among people living with HIV. We will adapt PL to an urban cohort of PLWH receiving care in Washington, DC, determine its efficacy compared to the standard of care at 12 months, and conduct mixed methods implementation science research to identify multi-level factors that characterize best practices to implement PL. If successful, this research will lead to the development of a novel and efficacious approach to improving retention in care and viral suppression among PLWH that could contribute to HIV epidemic control.",Pragmatic Efficacy Trial of mHealth to Improve HIV Outcomes in the DC Cohort,10082750,R01MH122375,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Appointment ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Cities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Insurance ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Urban Population ', ' Virginia ', ' Virus ', ' Washington ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Case Management ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' information resource ', ' knowledge resource ', ' knowledge resources ', ' Information Resources ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' next generation ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' usability ', ' implementation science ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' efficacy testing ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Secure ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' peer support ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' Android ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' efficacy study ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' pragmatic efficacy trial ', ' ']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,910434,0.099146036275097
"Influence of patient-centered HIV care on retention and viral suppression disparities Abstract Antiretroviral therapy leads to viral suppression which not only prevents the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and death among people living with HIV (PLH), but also prevents the transmission of HIV. Therefore, viral suppression is one of the key indicators in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States. On March 12, 2020, the Mayor of Miami- Dade County declared a State of Emergency in the County due to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) and on March 25, 2020 advised all people 65 and older and those with health conditions, including immunosuppression, to stay home. These and other necessary steps to combat COVID-19 had a far-reaching impact on HIV care; most HIV medical case management sites and HIV clinicians began delivering care via telehealth or telephone, reducing the availability of in-person services. Furthermore, the ripple effects due to the loss of the tourist industry and closure of nonessential businesses have led to widespread unemployment and economic hardship within the community with 67,000 unemployment claims as of April 21st. The Ryan White Program (RWP) serves about 52% of PLH in the United States and is the provider of last resort, serving uninsured and underinsured PLH. Thus, the RWP serves among the most socioeconomically vulnerable PLH. Anecdotal reports indicate that many PLH are struggling with the COVID-19 PHE-related changes in HIV care delivery and are experiencing significant hardships such as food insecurity. The objective of this study is to characterize the COVID-19 PHE-related changes in HIV care delivery (e.g. use of telehealth and other remote modes of delivery) and any related difficulties and the COVID-19 PHE-related socioeconomic and psychosocial hardships experienced by RWP clients and assess how these have affected HIV viral suppression among RWP clients. A further objective is to compare the effects by racial/ethnic and gender groups to identify any potential inequities. To accomplish these objectives, we will interview 300 RWP clients by telephone (130 Hispanic, 100 African American, and 70 Haitians with roughly half men and half women in each group) about their HIV care and COVID-19 PHE-related socioeconomic and psychosocial stressors and compare their HIV viral loads before and after the onset of the COVID-19 PHE. This study will provide important information about how the COVID-19 PHE is impacting viral suppression among RWP clients, and the extent to which COVID-19 PHE-related stressors are novel barriers to care. Any inequitable impacts by race/ethnicity and gender will also be examined. This information is also critical, because due to the immune suppression experienced by many PLH, it is likely that social distancing measures may be needed during HIV care delivery for an extended period of time during the current pandemic. Narrative The COVID-19 Public Health Emergency has led to important changes in how HIV care is delivered to protect people living with HIV from being exposed to the COVID-19 virus. Furthermore, because people living with HIV are more likely to have low incomes, they are particularly vulnerable to the economic hardships from the COVID-19 crisis. This supplemental study will evaluate the effects of the COVID-19-related changes in HIV care delivery and COVID-19-related economic and psychosocial hardships on viral load suppression among people living with HIV in the Miami-Dade County Ryan White Program.",Influence of patient-centered HIV care on retention and viral suppression disparities,10156759,R01MD012421,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Household ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' immune suppression ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Industry ', ' Interview ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Parents ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Resort ', ' Social Distance ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' United States ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' Case Management ', ' Family member ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' care delivery ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Sampling ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' telehealth ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' federal poverty level ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' combat ', ' public health emergency ', ' Haitian ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' food insecurity ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' ']",NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,163916,0.18884124722690956
"Targeting HIV Retention and Improved Viral load through Engagement ('THRIVE') Summary/ abstract: Poor retention in HIV primary care results in lower rates of HIV viral suppression, higher rates of HIV transmission, and exacerbates racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes, including survival. To date, there are no interventions that effectively relink and retain PWH in care when they are found outside the HIV clinic. Many persons with HIV infection (PWH) are hospitalized with life-threatening but preventable complications of inadequately treated HIV infection. They are among the most important patients to retain in care. Our previous research shows that among PWH who are out of care and hospitalized, avoidance coping, stigma, and mental health difficulties were nearly universal. Further, avoidance coping was a predictor of failure to re-engage in care after discharge. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a transdiagnostic intervention with the capacity to address a range of psychosocial and behavior-related issues that PWH experience. ACT helps patients overcome avoidance, particularly avoidance of uncomfortable internal states and the situations that trigger such states, by promoting acceptance-based coping and re-engagement in meaningful and valued-life activities. Brief ACT interventions appear to be feasible, acceptable, and at least preliminarily, have efficacy. We propose to develop, refine, and pilot a brief (4-5 contact hours) ACT intervention for hospitalized, out-of-care PWH. `Targeting HIV Retention and Improved Viral load through Engagement' (`THRIVE') will aim to help patients overcome avoidance, a maladaptive coping strategy implicated in a range of problems, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and HIV-related self-stigma, all of which constitute barriers to care. Delivering THRIVE in the hospital with a phone booster session after discharge will increase therapy initiation and completion, the lack of which is often the greatest obstacle to effective delivery of mental health services for PWH. In Aim 1, a brief hospital-based transdiagnostic, individually delivered ACT intervention (THRIVE) tailored specifically for out-of-care hospitalized PWH will be developed. Input from a multi-disciplinary team of expert care providers and PHW will be utilized to create the therapist protocol and patient workbook. We will then pilot THRIVE in 10 hospitalized out-of-care PWH who will provide qualitative feedback on the intervention. The feedback, along with input from patients and the multi-disciplinary team, will be used to refine THRIVE. In Aim 2, we will conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the refined THRIVE intervention (N=35) compared to treatment as usual (N=35). This pilot RCT will 1) evaluate feasibility and acceptability for a full- scale RCT; and 2) examine trends in outcomes of interest for the definitive RCT. We will then be positioned to submit a separate grant to test the efficacy of THRIVE in a fully powered randomized trial. This work has the potential to decrease HIV morbidity and racial/ethnic disparities and contribute to ending the HIV epidemic in the United States, which are NIH priorities. Project Narrative: Many people with HIV infection are not consistently engaged in outpatient HIV care, and avoidance, stigma and denial contribute to poor engagement in HIV care. This project will develop and pilot test a new intervention, “THRIVE,” for hospitalized persons who are out of HIV care and endorse avoidance, to improve how well they stay in outpatient HIV care after discharge. If successfully developed, the intervention will undergo large scale testing in later studies and could improve the health of persons with HIV infection and help end the HIV epidemic in the United States.",Targeting HIV Retention and Improved Viral load through Engagement ('THRIVE'),10082597,R34MH122294,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Prisons ', ' Research ', ' viral RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Viremia ', ' viraemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' virusemia ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Failure ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Life ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Life Sanctities ', ' Respect for Life ', ' Sanctity of Life ', ' Value of Life ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' peer ', ' treatment program ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' successful intervention ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' efficacy testing ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial incentive ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' improved outcome ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' ']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R34,2020,220134,0.1074006875389693
"Integrated Navigation Services for Treatment Adherence, Counseling, and Research (INSTACARE). PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this research is to determine whether a CHW intervention including a mobile telehealth (M-Health) component can help achieve long term viral suppression among Black people with poorly controlled HIV. The US Government’s Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative identified Miami-Dade County as a major epicenter of HIV. The County suffers from the Nation’s highest HIV incidence and excess AIDS-related mortality. Despite the availability of effective treatment and prevention, HIV disparities persist among certain demographic groups, especially Black communities. While Blacks comprise just 17% of the County’s population, they account for 64% of all AIDS-related deaths. This highlights a critical need for locally-designed strategies to facilitate improved access to HIV treatment and support for medication adherence. For over thirty years the University of Miami’s Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) has been dedicated to advancing HIV/AIDS research and partnering with the community to prevent, treat, and cure HIV/AIDS. This includes 12 years of research and service initiatives involving community health worker (CHW) interventions addressing disparities among Black people living with HIV (PLH). Our pilot work has already shown that Black PLH randomized to receive CHW support for 12 months had significantly improved viral suppression compared to those who received the usual standard of HIV care. More recently, our team has developed enhanced CHW interventions that combine personalized, home-based CHW support with mobile telehealth strategies to improve minority health outcomes. Building upon this research, we propose the Integrated Navigation Services for Treatment Adherence, Counseling, and Research (INSTACARE) study, a comprehensive CHW intervention to improve treatment adherence and viral suppression among Black PLH. Leveraging our established CHW network, the proposed research will integrate CHWs into HIV clinical care teams and examine the effects of a multi-level CHW and telehealth approach on viral suppression among Black people with uncontrolled HIV (viral load > 200 copies/ml). This proposal also builds upon our prior studies as well as our ongoing CHW programs providing street-based HIV outreach, education, and rapid screening in Black communities plagued by the worst HIV outcomes. Three hundred Black PLH who have not achieved viral suppression will be recruited from Miami’s public healthcare system. Participants will be randomized to a 12- month CHW intervention enhanced with mobile telehealth support versus usual HIV care. Pre and post assessments will determine intervention effects on viral load, medication adherence, hospitalizations, and self- efficacy in adhering to treatment and taking medications. The project will provide critically important research findings addressing existing knowledge gaps on the effectiveness of CHWs at improving HIV outcomes among Black PLH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Miami-Dade County has the highest HIV incidence in the Nation and is recognized by the US Government’s Ending the HIV Epidemic an epicenter of HIV disparities. Among adults in Miami, 1 in 31 Blacks are living with HIV, compared to 1 in 103 Whites and 1 in 127 LatinX; and 34% of Black PLH are not enrolled in HIV care that prevents disease progression to AIDS. Leveraging our established community health worker (CHW) programs in local Black neighborhoods, we propose to establish a clinic-integrated CHW intervention including a mobile telehealth component to help Black people with an uncontrolled HIV viral load improve medication adherence and achieve long term viral suppression.","Integrated Navigation Services for Treatment Adherence, Counseling, and

"Multi-level Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health and Missed HIV Healthcare Provider Visits Project Summary/Abstract  Despite the benefits of engagement in HIV care, a substantial number of black people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are poorly retained in care in the United States. An individual's race cannot fully explain these observed disparities in retention in HIV care. Social and behavioral determinants of health including an individual's actions, social/physical environment, and access to health services are also modifiable contributors. However, studies on the combined impact of individual-, community-, infrastructure/health system-, and structural-level social and behavioral determinants of health on retention in HIV care, with specific attention to race, are lacking. The aims of this study are: 1) To develop and validate a predictive model which will include race as well as social and behavioral determinants of heath from multiple levels (individual-, community-, infrastructure/health system-, and structural-level) and; 2) To identify modifiable individual-level patient-reported outcomes (i.e. mental health, alcohol and substance use, quality of life, symptom burden) which partially or fully mediate the relationship between black race and missed visits, after accounting for less easily modifiable, community-and structural-level confounders. These results will inform the design of an intervention package aimed to reduce missed HIV healthcare provider visits for black patients, a population disproportionately affected by poor HIV health-related outcomes. Additionally, they will provide a predictive model that will allow point-of-care ascertainment of risk of missing visits in order to target this intervention package toward black patients most likely to benefit.  This research team is uniquely positioned to complete the work proposed in this application. The principal investigator, Dr. Pettit has significant experience in conducting epidemiologic studies of HIV outcomes in large multi-cohort collaborations. Dr. Mugavero, a co-investigator on this proposal, brings content expertise in retention in HIV care and experience conducting studies of HIV outcomes within the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Drs. Shepherd, Rebeiro, and Turan, also co-investigators on this proposal, bring complimentary skills in biostatistics and epidemiology as well as behavioral science and psychometrics required to carry out the analytic plan. Other resources available to the research team include Vanderbilt's Clinical and Translational Science Award, the Tennessee and University of Alabama Centers for AIDS Research, and the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) Core services.  The proposed studies will provide important insights into the contribution of factors from multiple levels on missed HIV healthcare provider visits among black PLWHA in the United States. Moreover, these findings will inform the design and evaluation of a future intervention or support package aimed at modifiable social and behavioral determinants of health in order to improve health outcomes and reduce racial disparities for HIV- infected persons. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance Social and behavioral determinants of health are known to contribute to poorer retention in HIV care and increased HIV-related mortality among black patients in the United States. Our understanding of these determinants from multiple levels (individual, community, infrastructure/health system, and structural levels) and their influence on racial disparities in missing HIV healthcare provider visits is incomplete. Further characterization of the association of social and behavioral determinants of health from multiple levels with retention in HIV care among blacks is critical for the development and evaluation of intervention support packages aimed to decrease the number of missed clinic visits and mortality in this population.",Multi-level Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health and Missed HIV Healthcare Provider Visits,9822988,R01MH113438,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Attention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Black race ', ' Budgets ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Criminal Law ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Tennessee ', ' Triage ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Viremia ', ' viraemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' virusemia ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Healthcare Visit ', ' Health Care Visit ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' Behavioral ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,388719,0.15681953362650117
"PROMISE - Program Refinements to Optimize Model Impact and Scalability based on Evidence Abstract  In New York, the achievement of 90-90-90 goals is jeopardized not by limited access to affordable care and treatment, but by persistent disparities in HIV viral suppression (VS). Complex behavioral and structural barriers to achieving and maintaining VS require coordinated, combination approaches to meet medical and social service needs. In 2009, at 28 Ryan White Part A (RWPA)-funded agencies, the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) launched a multi-component HIV Care Coordination Program (CCP) directed toward the most vulnerable, high-need persons living with HIV (PLWH) in NYC. A systematic CCP effectiveness study began in 2013 (R01 MH101028; PIs: Irvine, Nash). Findings to date suggest that the CCP is superior to usual care for high-need subgroups of PLWH, but there remains substantial room for improvement in short- and long-term VS. In an immediate evidence-to- practice feedback loop, the DOHMH is implementing a refined CCP model in 2018. Greater focusing, tailoring and cues for delivery of key components are expected to increase CCP engagement, reach, fidelity, scalability, effectiveness and impact. The aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Estimate the effectiveness of the revised (vs. original) CCP on timely VS (≤4 months), using experimental methods (Aim 1); 2) Estimate the effectiveness of the revised CCP (vs. `usual care') on longer-term VS, including VS at 12 months and durable viral suppression (DVS) at 24-36 months, using rigorous observational comparison group methods (Aim 2); and 3) Identify attributes and drivers of provider and client engagement in the intervention and provider and client preferences for future revised-CCP delivery and receipt (Aim 3). Prior studies have not demonstrated any intervention to be effective at improving short- and long-term VS among the many PLWH with major barriers to HIV care continuum engagement. The proposed study, to be conducted on a large scale in real-world HIV service settings, will document the rollout and effects of evidence-informed implementation course corrections to an intervention model focused on these most vulnerable PLWH. In this way, the work will advance a second generation of interventions capable of strengthening the care continuum among PLWH who have been unable to achieve desired ART outcomes in existing interventions, due to major structural or psychosocial barriers. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health  The proposed large-scale study will test the hypotheses of a revised HIV care coordination intervention's benefits over the original intervention and over `usual care,' with respect to both short-term and long-term clinical outcomes. This project brings together multiple data sources for tracking HIV care continuum completion in relation to publicly funded services, to guide HIV policymakers in New York and elsewhere in making critical decisions about program adjustments to optimize viral load suppression with limited available resources. Through a partnership including the Institute for Implementation Science and Population Health at the City University of New York, the New York City Health Department and six direct service provider agencies, findings from the proposed study will immediately be translated to HIV services planning and practice improvements, thus reducing HIV-related mortality and morbidity and preventing further HIV transmission.",PROMISE - Program Refinements to Optimize Model Impact and Scalability based on Evidence,9851450,R01MH117793,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Cities ', ' Client ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Cues ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Epidemic ', ' Evolution ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Funding Source ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparator group ', ' comparison group ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' instably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' unstably housed ', ' housing instability ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' implementation science ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' population health ', ' course implementation ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Service model ', ' care delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' service providers ', ' Service setting ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' Infrastructure ', ' multiple data sources ', ' ']",NIMH,GRADUATE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH POLICY,R01,2020,548897,0.12983542059462055
"Women-centered HIV care practices that facilitate HIV care retention and viral suppression in the presence of adverse sociocultural factors PROJECT SUMMARY Achieving high rates of retention in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy leads to high rates of viral suppression, which not only reduces mortality and improves quality of living, among people living with HIV infection, but also reduces HIV transmission within affected communities. HIV care outcomes among women have been suboptimal; in 2014, viral suppression was 52.6% among African Americans, 57.9% among Whites, and 59.8% among Latinas compared with 66.0% among White men. Women living with HIV infection are more likely to face barriers to successful HIV care such as child care burden, abuse, and extreme poverty than men. In addition, women, in particular women of color, can face multiple layers of stigma including those related to their race, ethnicity, HIV infection, drug use, and poverty status. Partly because the HIV epidemic initially affected mostly men, the HIV care system is not designed to meet women's special needs. Implementing women-centered HIV care has been proposed nationally and internationally as a way to address women's needs. However, this idea has not been well operationalized for HIV care and has not been examined in the context of the United States health care system including the Ryan White Program, which serves 65% of women living with HIV in the United States. Our central hypothesis is that the more women-centric a system is, the higher the likelihood of HIV care retention and viral suppression among women. The objective of this application is to identify effective provider and system women-centered HIV care practices within the Ryan White Program that positively influence HIV care retention and viral suppression among women experiencing sociocultural challenges. We will accomplish this objective with a mixed methods study examining patient intake and billing data from women enrolled in the Miami-Dade County Ryan White Program, conducting in-depth interviews with case managers, health care providers, administrators, and women living with HIV, and conducting a survey of 600 women living with HIV in the Miami- Dade County Ryan White Program. We propose the following three specific aims: 1) Identify sociocultural factors that influence HIV care retention and viral suppression, including those unique to women and those having a differential impact on African American, Haitian and Latina women; 2) Ascertain current and potential health care provider and system women-centered HIV care practices that may mitigate the effect of adverse sociocultural factors on HIV care retention and antiretroviral therapy adherence; 3) Identify specific health care provider and system women-centered HIV care practices that most strongly influence HIV care retention, adherence, and viral suppression among all women and in African American, Haitian and Latina women. This project addresses the National HIV/AIDS Strategy goals to increase access to care, improve health outcomes, and reduce HIV-related health disparities and the Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-Related Research call for research to promote HIV care engagement and to reduce disparities in treatment outcomes. NARRATIVE There is a critical need to improve HIV care outcomes and reduce health disparities among women living with HIV infection for their individual benefit and the benefit of their communities. This project will involve analysis of Ryan White Program administrative client intake and billing data, interviews of health care providers, case managers, and administrators, and interviews with women who are patients in the Ryan White HIV care program to identify effective ways for the health care system to better serve the needs of women, especially minority women, living with HIV infection.",Women-centered HIV care practices that facilitate HIV care retention and viral suppression in the presence of adverse sociocultural factors,10038590,R01MD013563,"['Affect ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Client ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Administrator ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Immigrant ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' metropolitan ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Care Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Case Manager ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' Intake ', ' International ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' care burden ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' billing data ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' improved outcome ', ' Haitian ', ' Cuban ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,45368,0.27172353386086995
"Informal Mentors and the HIV Care Engagement of Young Minority Men in the Southern U.S. Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) ages 18 to 29 have been drastically affected by the HIV epidemic. Moreover, HIV+ YBMSM have lower rates of engagement in the HIV Care Cascade compared to other sub-populations, which includes the steps of being linked to care, retained in care, initiating and remaining adherent to antiretroviral therapy, and achieving viral suppression. HIV+ YBMSM living in the southern United States (the South) are a particularly at-risk group, as the South is the region in the U.S. with the highest HIV mortality. Despite the profound disparities in HIV morbidity and mortality affecting HIV+ YBMSM living in the South, there is a dearth of interventions to increase HIV+ YBMSM engagement along the HIV Care Cascade. Informal mentors who provide social support and role-modeling can help encourage health behaviors such as safer sex practices and increased self-advocacy in the healthcare system among adolescents and young adults, in general. Importantly, informal mentors are identified by many young MSM as positive influences in their lives. Thus, the inclusion of informal mentors already in the lives of HIV+ YBMSM in supporting HIV care engagement may be a promising strategy to reduce HIV disparities. Based on Social Action Theory (SAT) and Mentoring Theory, this exploratory R21 proposal seeks to examine the extent to which informal mentors can impact contextual (e.g., employment) and individual (e.g., self-confidence) factors predicted by SAT to be related to HIV care engagement among HIV+ YBMSM. Qualitative interviews will be used to explore ways informal mentors can impact factors important to the engagement of HIV+ YBMSM in HIV care. We will interview HIV+ YBMSM (n = 48), across both early and young adulthood and those engaged and not engaged in care, as well as HIV+ YBMSM reporting they do not have an informal mentor, to explore their perspectives regarding contextual and individual factors that affect HIV care engagement, and the extent to which informal mentors have helped address those factors. In addition, 24 dyads of HIV+ YBMSM and informal mentors (n = 48 people), representing a variety of types of reported factors affecting HIV care engagement, will discuss with each other ways that are acceptable to them both that mentors could help address particular factors that have affected the likelihood of each HIV+ YBMSM to engage in HIV care. Finally, based on the findings from the individual and dyadic interviews, the research team will outline content and format of an intervention involving informal mentors in supporting HIV+ YBMSM in engagement along the HIV Care Cascade. The team will elicit feedback on the intervention outline from a Community Advisory Board and Expert Panel throughout the intervention outline development process. This study will provide data vital to setting the stage for an R34 proposal to manualize and examine feasibility and acceptability of an HIV care engagement intervention that involves informal mentors for HIV+ YBMSM living in the South. Project Narrative Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) demonstrate the highest rates of new HIV infections of any group in the U.S., and once infected, have lower rates of linkage to care, retention in care, and viral suppression compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Informal mentors, or adults who act as role models and provide social support, are present in the lives of many YBMSM, and are naturally occurring interpersonal resources that have been under- examined as potential supports for engagement in HIV care among HIV+ YBMSM. The goal of this exploratory study is to examine, from the perspectives of both HIV+ YBMSM and informal mentors living in the Southern U.S., the extent to which it is feasible and acceptable for mentors to impact contextual (e.g., employment) and individual (e.g., motivation) factors associated with engagement in HIV care, as well as engagement behaviors along the HIV Treatment Cascade among HIV+ YBMSM.",Informal Mentors and the HIV Care Engagement of Young Minority Men in the Southern U.S.,9982439,R21MH119004,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Appointment ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Employment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' suburb ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Viral ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' condomless intercourse ', ' condomless sex ', ' unprotected intercourse ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' Safe Sex ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' AAMSM ', ' African American MSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' BMSM ', ' black MSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R21,2020,199492,0.21223489810393248
"A Gender Transformative Implementation Strategy with Providers to Improve HIV Outcomes in Uganda Abstract Antiretroviral treatment (ART) is the single most effective clinical intervention in the fight against HIV. However, in Uganda only 56% of people living with HIV were virally suppressed in 2017 with significant disparities between men and women, suggesting problems with implementation. While gender norms are a known driver of HIV disparities in sub-Saharan Africa, and patient-provider relationships are a key factor in HIV care engagement, little research has focused on the role that gender norms have in shaping the equitable provision of treatment and quality of ART counseling. The proposed training plan in this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the knowledge and skills needed for the principal investigator, Katelyn M. Sileo, PhD, MPH, to develop a program of research to investigate and address these issues. The overall research objective is to develop and pilot test an implementation strategy to increase providers' capacity to provide equitable and gender-tailored treatment and counseling to HIV-infected men and women. Delivered to HIV providers, this 4-session group training integrates a gender transformative approach with adapted evidence-based strategies to reduce biases and increase gender equitable attitudes. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science Research (CFIR) will be used to guide a comprehensive needs assessment to inform the development of the implementation strategy, including qualitative data collected from clinic staff and leadership, patients, and community members. The implementation strategy will be assessed through a quasi-experimental delayed implementation design. Two clinics in Luwero and Wakiso District will be randomly assigned to either the Training Only (4 group sessions) or Training+ (4 group sessions plus additional maintenance sessions) conditions, with cross-over in 6-month intervals. The pilot trial will assess the implementation strategy's effectiveness by comparing changes in provider (N=30-36) (gender awareness and equitable attitudes) and patient (N=240) outcomes (quality of care, satisfaction, clinic attendance, ART adherence, viral load) across Training, Training+, and Usual Care through 18-months. The trial will also qualitatively explore CFIR barriers and facilitators to implementation and future adoption. This research project paired with coursework, workshops, academic conferences, one-on-one mentorship, and manuscript and grant-writing will target the following three training aims: (1) Develop expertise in the field of implementation science; (2) Develop expertise in gender theory and gender transformative health interventions; (3) Gain mastery of advanced statistical methods in the evaluation of implementation science research designs. Dr. Sileo will be mentored by an interdisciplinary team of world-renowned experts in HIV, implementation science, and gender ideologies. This K01 project will develop Dr. Sileo into an independent scientist specializing in the use of implementation science to reduce gender disparities in HIV outcomes. Project narrative Gender norms embedded in the health-system and broader community shape patient-provider relationships in ways that may undermine the provision of antiretroviral treatment (ART) counseling for men and women in Uganda. This study seeks to develop and evaluate an innovative gender transformative implementation strategy to improve HIV provider capacity for equitable HIV care and ART adherence counseling. This implementation strategy has the potential to improve patients' HIV care engagement and viral load suppression, reduce gender disparities in HIV outcomes, and ultimately reduce HIV mortality and HIV transmission.",A Gender Transformative Implementation Strategy with Providers to Improve HIV Outcomes in Uganda,9927157,K01MH121663,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Counseling ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Epidemic ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Uganda ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sexism ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' member ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' pilot trial ', ' fight against ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' implementation science ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' treatment adherence ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' gender disparity ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' service delivery ', ' patient engagement ', ' implementation strategy ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,K01,2020,150196,0.08559622613840114
"Integration of Peer Navigation and mHealth Technology to Improve Viral Suppression among Racial and Ethnic Minority PLWH in Community-Based HIV Care Clinics PROJECT SUMMARY Significant disparities continue to exist in the HIV care continuum in the U.S., with Hispanic and Black persons living with HIV (HBPLH) being less likely to achieve viral suppression compared to non-Hispanic White persons living with HIV. The same HIV treatment disparities exist in San Diego County, one of the focal counties under the Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative. Disparities are exacerbated by co-occurring syndemic conditions, including substance use. Peer navigators, as one type of community health worker, have been shown to play meaningful roles to support PLH to stay engaged in care in developing countries. More rigorous studies are needed to evaluate the impact of peer navigators on the HIV care continuum in the U.S. While peer navigators may promote positive outcomes among PLH, scale-up of the traditional peer navigation approach is difficult in real-world settings where there are limited resources to support peer navigators. Scalable, mHealth intervention approaches are needed to strengthen the impact of peers on the HIV care continuum outcomes among HBPLH. Mobile (m)Health and other technologies offer scalable platforms for intervention delivery through channels (e.g., online, mobile apps, SMS, and social networking platforms) that can overcome limitations and costs of in-person interventions. Combining both peer navigators and mHealth into a unified, scalable intervention could both strengthen the impact of peer navigators on HIV care continuum outcomes among HBPLH, and simultaneously reduce the resources needed to support peer navigators in clinical settings, effectively striking the ideal balance between maximizing clinical effect sizes and lowering peer navigator costs to promote sustainability. Partnering with a community-based clinic (San Ysidro Health, SYH) serving HBPLH under the Ryan White model in South San Diego, we propose a two-arm RCT (n=375) of an mHealth peer navigator intervention called Peers plus mobile App for Treatment in HIV (PATH). We will integrate two theoretically-grounded interventions developed by this team – one with a strong peer navigator component (called “Conexiones Saludables”) and the other with a scalable mHealth component (called “LinkPositively”)– into the PATH intervention, with the goal of amplifying the impact of peer navigators on viral suppression among HBPLH. We will integrate, refine, and usability test (Phase 1) these interventions into a unified, community-informed intervention, PATH, to be rigorously evaluated in a RCT (Phase 2). We will test the efficacy of PATH with 375 HBPLH (among whom >33% will report stimulant and/or opioid use in the past 6 months) to: 1) Improve sustained viral suppression (i.e., suppressed viral load at both 6- and 12-month follow-up) compared to usual care; 2) Examine the theory-informed mediators (e.g., self- efficacy to engage in HIV care, HIV stigma) through which PATH has the greatest impact on sustained viral suppression among HBPLH; and 3) Explore whether PATH significantly affects substance-related outcomes (e.g., frequency of substance use, engagement in substance abuse treatment) when compared to usual care among those using substances (i.e., stimulants and/or opioids). PROJECT NARRATIVE The primary goal of this project is to address racial/ethnic disparities in the HIV care continuum by evaluating the efficacy of a novel intervention called “PATH” that integrates peer navigation with mobile health (mHealth) technology with Hispanic and Black persons living with HIV (HBPLH). We believe PATH has the potential to be an impactful, sustainable, mHealth peer navigation approach encompassing a powerful suite of theory-based components to strengthen the impact of peer navigators and reduce HIV treatment disparities among HBPLH, including among persons living with HIV with co-occurring substance use. We will partner with a community- based clinic that serves HBPLH under the Ryan White model of care in South San Diego to conduct this randomized trial.",Integration of Peer Navigation and mHealth Technology to Improve Viral Suppression among Racial and Ethnic Minority PLWH in Community-Based HIV Care Clinics,10164225,R01DA053167,"['Affect ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Counseling ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' developing country ', ' developing nation ', ' Heroin ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fentanyl ', ' Actiq ', ' Duragesic ', ' Fentanest ', ' Fentyl ', ' Phentanyl ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Mexico ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Play ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Crack Cocaine ', ' free base cocaine ', ' Competence ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' clinical effect ', ' usability ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' clinical care ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' peer support ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid use ', ' navigator intervention ', ' racial minority ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' web application ', ' web app ', ' stimulant use ', ' ']",NIDA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,700312,0.06251695056838297
"Addressing violence and HIV cascade of care outcomes among transgender women PROJECT SUMMARY Transgender (`trans') women of color experience violence in a variety of contexts, including from partners, strangers, law enforcement, healthcare providers, and in public accommodations. Violence is consistently linked with avoiding care, suboptimal ART adherence, and lower odds of viral suppression via pathways including chronic stress, immune inflammatory response, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and substance use. These epidemics are concurrent and mutually reinforcing, constituting a “syndemic” or synergistic interaction that contributes to documented inequities in HIV continuum of care outcomes. In Detroit, Michigan, trans women of color are one of the `most-at-risk' groups for HIV, with significant disparities in engagement in HIV care. In this R21 exploratory/developmental research application, we propose to adapt and pilot test a culturally-responsive, evidence-based, and trauma-informed intervention to improve engagement in HIV care (primary outcome), reduce PTSD symptoms (secondary outcome), and increase sustained viral suppression (tertiary outcome) among trans women of color living with HIV. Guided by the ADAPT-ITT model, our first aim seeks to conduct a systematic adaptation of the intervention, with a focus on the unique aspects of violence, gender affirmation needs, and engagement in HIV care by conducting interviews with trans women of color and key stakeholders to inform the adaptation. Our community advisory board consisting of trans women of color will review all adapted materials. The second aim seeks to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the adapted intervention in a one-arm pilot with follow-ups immediate and 3-month post- intervention. The third aim seeks to gather qualitative data from one-arm pilot participants to identify strategies to overcome barriers to implementing rigorous randomized controlled trial research designs with trans women of color within limited-resources settings. Study findings will provide the necessary groundwork for a subsequent community-engaged large-scale randomized controlled trial. Findings also have the potential to provide a blueprint to guide future research efforts with trans women of color who are often embedded in close- knit communities with few existing culturally-responsive services. Public Health Relevance Statement: Transgender women of color living with HIV experience trauma and violence, which contributes to inequities across the HIV continuum of care, specifically in engagement in care. The proposed exploratory/developmental R21 application seeks to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted evidence-based trauma- informed intervention for transgender women of color living with HIV to improve engagement in HIV care and reduce post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms.

"LetSync: An mHealth approach to HIV care engagement among black men in couples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Based on current diagnoses rates, one in two Black men-who-have-sex-with-men (BMSM) will be diagnosed with HIV during their lifetime. Interventions to optimize retention in care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among BMSM are urgently needed to reduce HIV racial disparities. Dyadic intervention approaches are promising, given that nearly half of BMSM living with HIV are in primary relationships, and are consistent with calls for research with BMSM to focus beyond the individual level. Our preliminary research with BMSM in couples finds that the primary relationship is often the main resource in meeting needs in HIV care engagement. BMSM couples engage in joint problem-solving and dyadic coordination of care that entail synchronizing and co-organizing schedules, activities, and behaviors around treatment and care. We also found that dyadic coordination and joint problem-solving in care engagement may be more common among BMSM couples with greater couple’s resilience, defined as the couple’s capacity to overcome shared adversity that buffers against the strains of social and structural factors on health and wellbeing for BMSM. Based on our preliminary work and extant research, we developed a theoretical Framework of Dyadic HIV Care Engagement to guide this research. Smartphones are ubiquitous among BMSM of various ages and socioeconomic backgrounds, and mobile technology for health (mHealth) is feasible, acceptable, and effective as HIV interventions among BMSM. We have developed initial designs for a BMSM-couple-focused intervention application (app), LetSync, to improve retention in care and ART adherence. BMSM couples showed a great interest in this approach. However, critical issues remain, such as the need for a deeper understanding of how dyadic processes interrelate to bolster dyadic capacity, how they may be targeted in an mHealth intervention, and the need for piloting intervention components and features. As such, the aims to this R01 are as follows. Aim 1 will involve investigating interrelated dyadic processes in HIV care engagement (couple’s resilience, joint problem-solving, dyadic coordination) through in-depth interviews with BMSM in 12 seroconcordant-positive and 12 serodiscordant couples (24 couples, N=48) guided by our conceptual framework. Aim 2 will develop a couple’s mHealth intervention informed by Aim 1 and our prior mHealth designs, through iterative app development with a community advisory council of BMSM couples and a mini-pilot of the app prototype, intervention protocols, and procedures. Aim 3 will entail a randomized, waitlist-controlled pilot trial with 80 couples (N=160) to assess its acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary impact on retention in care and ART adherence as measured by antiretroviral concentrations in hair. Findings from the proposed research are critical for informing a subsequent full-scale RCT to test the efficacy of LetSync in improving HIV care and treatment outcomes among BMSM couples toward reducing HIV racial disparities in the U.S. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventions to optimize HIV care engagement among Black men-who-have-sex-with-men are critically needed to reduce HIV racial disparities. Intervention approaches for targeting couples are promising.

"Neighborhoods, Networks, and the HIV Care Continuum among HIV-infected MSM in NYC Abstract  Marked disparities by race/ethnicity exist in HIV infection rates and engagement and retention in care among men who have sex with men (MSM) along the HIV care continuum. Compared with White MSM, HIV- infected Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM are less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART), adhere to ART, and achieve viral suppression. Lower rates of care engagement and retention among Black and Latino MSM are influenced by factors beyond the individual. In order to uncover the neighborhood- and network-involved pathways that produce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV care outcomes, yielding an empirical basis for interventions and policies to fill gaps in the care continuum among Black and Latino MSM, systematic, theory- based investigation of the specific and intersecting neighborhood and network characteristics that relate to retention in care, ART adherence, and viral suppression must be engaged.  Using socioecological and intersectional conceptual frameworks, several mid-range and micro social and psychological theories, and informed by our NIH/NIMH R56-funded formative research, we propose to identify neighborhood-and network-level characteristics associated with HIV care continuum outcomes (viral suppression, retention in care, and ART adherence) among 550 HIV-infected MSM living in New York City (NYC) via a longitudinal study. We will investigate the influence of neighborhood composition and four neighborhood-level characteristics domains, testing theoretical pathways of influence across the different neighborhoods in which MSM live, socialize, and receive HIV care.  The Specific Aims are, among HIV-infected MSM in NYC: Aim 1: To use spatial analysis to characterize clustering and spatial trends in HIV care outcomes. Aim 2: To examine HIV care outcomes by race/ethnicity in relationship to longitudinal changes in: 2a) Exposure to neighborhoods of potential influence (home; social; health facility access); 2b) Neighborhood characteristics conceptual domains (community violence/physical disorder/social disorganization; AOD use factors; social norms; community resources); 2c) Social networks. Aim 3: To use multilevel modeling to assess associations among changes over time in exposure to the neighborhood characteristics and changes in social networks with HIV care outcomes by race/ethnicity, while assessing the potential mediating and moderating effects of individual- and network-level factors.  The study will employ an innovative approach combining geospatial mapping of neighborhoods with multilevel modeling, spatial statistics, and an existing, extensive geospatial database. It will have direct implications for the design of multilevel interventions, addressing factors at the neighborhood-, network-, and individual-levels, to improve HIV care outcomes for MSM, particularly for Black and Latino MSM. Project Narrative The study purpose is to examine the neighborhoods in which HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City live, socialize, and get HIV medical care and the structure and make-up of social networks (connections between friends, family members, etc.) over time, and to assess the relationship of these characteristics to achieving undetectable HIV viral load, being retained in HIV care, and adhering to HIV drugs. The study will also examine how these factors differ by race/ethnicity. This study will have direct impact on the design of programs to improve HIV care among MSM, particularly for Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM.","Neighborhoods, Networks, and the HIV Care Continuum among HIV-infected MSM in NYC",9920215,R01MH118960,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Award ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Facility Accesses ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Housing ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Overdose ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Disorganizations ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Socialization ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Family member ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' urban planning ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' race discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Fostering ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Conceptual Domain ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' greenspace ', ' Green space ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social deficits ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER,R01,2020,859867,0.08156488179816992
"Implementation of Seek, Test, Treat & Retain Strategies among People Who Inject Drugs in Malaysia Project Summary Most people living with HIV (PLWH) in Malaysia also have an opioid use disorder (OUD), yet only a minority receive ART and OUD treatment, resulting in increased mortality and HIV incidence. The proposed pragmatic, multisite, implementation and effectiveness research will evaluate a strategy to improve HIV treatment outcomes (increased rates of patients on ART with virological suppression, improved treatment retention and ART adherence) for PLWH with OUD. Engaging 4 large regional HIV/AIDS treatment centers in Malaysia, with a stepped rollout of the study protocol across the study sites, offset by one year with a random order of the sites initiation, the study will evaluate barriers and facilitators for implementation of improved care model and will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the model in a clinical trial. At each of the study sites, individuals testing HIV positive who also have OUD (n=4x70) will be enrolled to receive concurrent ART and MMT based on the usual care standards. Their patient level outcomes will be compared with individuals meeting the same inclusion criteria (n=4x70) and treated under the proposed improved model (post implementation evaluation). The usual care standard will consist of provision of ART and medical care for HIV and other medical HIV co- morbidities provided at the HIV/AIDS treatment center with an expedited and facilitated referral to a methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). The improved care model will include the usual care supplemented by continuing education and coaching of medical staff at HIV/AIDS and MMT clinics and by provision of additional peer-based counseling intervention focused on behavioral skills and strategies that patients can learn and master to achieve uninterrupted, long-term ART treatment participation while continuing OUD recovery through MMT. The primary outcome measure, rates of patients with virologic suppression (< 20 copies/mL) in the two care models will be assessed at 24 weeks. The secondary outcomes, also followed for 24 weeks, will include ART adherence measured by objective measures (tenofovir dried blood spots, clinic records) and self-report; decreased illicit opioid use measured by rates of opioid negative urine toxicology results and self-report; and improvements on other health-related and functional status outcomes. A statistically significant effect on the primary outcome and clinically meaningful effects on secondary outcomes favoring the improved care model are hypothesized. Concurrently at each study site, using implementation science mixed methods research tools and engaging key local stakeholders (treatment providers, patients, their families, and community activists), and evaluating clinical and healthcare data, the study will assess existing barriers (organizational, personnel, and community level factors) and uncover available resources and facilitators for a successful implementation of the improved care model. The research will provide critically important evidence for implementation of effective Seek-Test-Treat, and Retain models for PLWH and OUD throughout Malaysia and inform healthcare policy in other low to middle income countries and regions with limited healthcare resources. Project Narrative In Malaysia, similar to most countries where HIV-related mortality and incidence are concentrated in people who inject drugs (PWID), currently offered guideline-concordant HIV treatment for people living with HIV (PLWH) consists of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and medical care for HIV, hepatitis, TB, and other medical HIV co-morbidities provided at the specialty HIV/AIDS treatment center, but PLWH with co-occurring opioid use disorder (OUD) are referred to an outside OUD treatment program, typically a methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), and their ART initiation is delayed until they are stable in OUD recovery. Research and clinical evidence indicates that the overall effectiveness of this treatment model is low: only a small proportion of PLWH and OUD receive ART and MMT concurrently, and those who do, have low treatment adherence and/or discontinue both MMT and ART. The proposed pragmatic, multisite study will collect critically important evidence for overcoming barriers to implementation of fully integrated and effective Seek-Test-Treat and Retain (STTR) care models for PLWH with OUD in Malaysia, will provide a rigorous scientific test of the hypothesized comparative effectiveness advantage over the current models of care, and will inform healthcare policy guidelines in Malaysia and in other countries.","Implementation of Seek, Test, Treat & Retain Strategies among People Who Inject Drugs in Malaysia",9982284,R01DA047789,"['Blood ', ' Blood

"Identifying and Engaging Urban HIV infected and uninfected YBMSM in care Project Summary The U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy 2020 calls for increasing access to care and improving outcomes of people living with HIV and targeting biomedical prevention efforts (including access to pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) where HIV is most heavily concentrated. Baltimore, MD; Washington, DC; and Philadelphia, PA (BWP) are disproportionately burdened by high rates of new cases of HIV infection, with disproportionate rates in young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) aged 15 to 24. High incidence underscores the need for increased identification, linkage and initiation in HIV and preventive care for YBMSM. Grants focused on high rates directly address NIH research priorities to reduce health disparities in the incidence of HI, in ART outcomes or in high HIV prevalent or high-risk areas. This innovative proposal seeks to test, treat and retain YBMSM living in BWP along the prevention and treatment continuums using the following aims: Aim 1. Identify and recruit young (ages 15-24) black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) in 3 urban cities who are (1) HIV-infected, not virally suppressed; and (2) high-risk HIV uninfected YBMSM, including gender variant and questioning men, using respondent driven sampling with targeted seed identification; Aim 2. Compare the efficacy of two study arms (mobile-enhanced engagement intervention (MEI) vs. standard of care (SOC)) to achieve sustained retention (measured by ≥ 4 follow up visits per 18 months) and engagement in HIV care (measured by durable viral suppression (HIV VL < 200 copies/ml) and substance treatment among 300 HIV infected YBMSM who are not virally suppressed and recruited from RDS; and Aim 3. Modify and implement mobile-enhanced intervention for 300 high-risk HIV uninfected YBMSM, recruited from RDS to promote linkage, retention and engagement of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and substance treatment uptake over 12 months, comparing younger (15-19) and older (20-24) participants. The mobile-enhanced engagement intervention is driven by the expressed and self-determined needs of each HIV infected and uninfected participant and includes care navigation, engagement, treatment and adherence, with a supplemental SBIRT+ intervention, to support YBMSM who face barriers accessing substance use treatment. By building upon existing case management services and flexibility to be adapted across ages and maturity and for prevention services, this intervention has the ability to transform networks, HIV and prevention care in YBMSM in cities with very high primary and secondary HIV transmission. Project Narrative This 3-city proposal seeks to address disparities of HIV in YBMSM in a multilevel intervention to identify, link retain and engage, high-risk uninfected and HIV infected urban YBMSM in prevention and treatment cascade. The mobile-enhanced engagement intervention is driven by the expressed and self-determined needs of each HIV infected and uninfected participant and includes care navigation, engagement, treatment and adherence, with a supplemental SBIRT+ intervention, to support YBMSM who face barriers accessing substance use treatment.

"FANMI: Community Cohort Care for HIV-Infected Adolescent Girls in Haiti Abstract: Sexually active HIV-infected adolescent girls are an extremely vulnerable and underserved population. If treated promptly with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and retained in care, individuals have a near normal life expectancy. Further, ART will decrease vertical and sexual HIV transmission in a population who are sexually active, have high rates of pregnancy and multiple seronegative partners. However, in Haiti and other resource poor countries, HIV-infected adolescents are three times more likely to be lost from care than adults, with only approximately 50% of HIV-infected teens remaining in care at one year. We have developed FANMI (My Family), an innovative model to improve HIV care for adolescent girls. HIV- infected girls age 16-19 years attend monthly HIV care in cohorts of 5-8 peers. All HIV care takes place in a community center rather than in a medical clinic. Each monthly visit integrates clinical care, peer group counseling, and social activities in a single session by the same provider to simplify care and strengthen the relationships between peers and providers. Preliminary data from our pilot study suggest dramatic improvements in retention with 91% of girls remaining in care at one year. Primary Aim: To conduct a randomized controlled trial at the GHESKIO Center in Port au Prince, Haiti. We will randomize 160 HIV-infected girls age 16-19 years (80 per arm) to FANMI versus standard of care with the primary study endpoint being alive and in care at 12 months. We will have >80% power to detect an improvement in retention at 12 months from 60% in the standard group to 85% in FANMI. Secondary Aims: To compare FANMI versus standard care on the following outcomes:  a. Plasma HIV-1 RNA < 1000 copies/µl at 12 months. We predict that 30% of participants in the standard  arm will have a suppressed viral load at 12 months compared to 60% in the FAMNI arm due to improved  retention, increased visit attendance, and improved ART adherence.  b. Sexual risk behavior: self-reported sexual activity, condom use, incidence of sexually-transmitted infections,  and pregnancy rate over 12 months.  c. Acceptability: We will conduct in-depth interviews to evaluate FANMI and factors associated with retention.  d. Health care utilization and costs of FANMI versus standard care. FANMI has the potential to dramatically improve HIV-infected adolescent treatment outcomes across the HIV care cascade and serve as a model of adolescent HIV care in Haiti and other resource-poor countries. NARRATIVE Retention of adolescents in HIV care is essential for prevention of morbidity, mortality, and HIV transmission, but in Haiti, HIV-infected adolescents are three times more likely to be lost from HIV care than adults, with only 50% of HIV-infected teens remaining in care at one year. This study aims to evaluate a model of Cohort Care, in which HIV-infected adolescent girls are seen in the community in cohorts of 5-8 peers integrating clinical care, peer group counseling, and social activities in a single session by the same provider.

"Corrections2Community: Post-release retention in HIV care for ex-inmates in South Africa PROJECT SUMMARY The availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has markedly reduced HIV-related mortality and morbidity in Africa. Yet HIV remains the leading cause of death among adult men and women in South Africa due fails to initiated ART or remain in care. Between 2 and 3% of HIV-infected men in South Africa pass through the corrections system annually. While incarcerated uptake of ART is excellent, unfortunately after release most are lost from care. Qualitative and quantitative research conducted by the research team with 492 ex-inmates in South Africa indicates that upon release from correctional settings, this population encounters confusion regarding where and when to receive care, long queueing times, family abandonment and limited social capital, enacted stigma, economic insecurity, and substance use (injection drug use reported by 11% of our participants). This project seeks to further characterize loss from care following release and to develop and pilot test a group support and HIV care model to retain ex-inmates in HIV care. This support group approach is based on adapting the South African community adherence clubs for a special vulnerable population. Such a care and support group for ex-inmates transitioning in care (a transition community adherence club or TCAC) has the potential to simultaneously address the multiple barriers to medical care through addressing social and care delivery barriers. We hypothesize that intervening on these levels will impact retention in care, virologic suppression, morbidity, and HIV transmission. The current proposal will allow for the development and piloting of this TCAC strategy to improve HIV care for ex-inmates to increase knowledge regarding care engagement for ex-inmates and to prepare for a randomized clinical trial of the TCAC powered for an effectiveness outcome of in-care with an undetectable viral load at 6 months after release. HIV remains the leading cause of death in South Africa as a result of a failure of people living with HIV to seek HIV treatment and be retained in care. After initiating antiretroviral therapy while incarcerated, most ex-inmates fail to remain engaged in care. The goal of this research is to reduce mortality, morbidity, and HIV transmission by developing an actionable approach to retaining these individuals in HIV care.",Corrections2Community: Post-release retention in HIV care for ex-inmates in South Africa,9850999,R34MH115777,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communities ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Support Groups ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' South Africa ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' virology ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Process Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Failure ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' social bonding ', ' social attachment ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' correctional system ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' trial comparing ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' traditional care ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' arm ', ' injection drug use ', ' South African ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' secondary analysis ', ' socio-demographic factors ', ' sociodemographic factors ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R34,2020,116837,0.20232332035220982
"Influence of patient-centered HIV care on retention and viral suppression disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Achieving high rates of retention in human immunodeficiency (HIV) care and viral suppression through antiretroviral therapy not only reduces mortality, but also is a means to reduce the incidence of HIV in affected communities because viral suppression greatly decreases communicability and prevents the transmission of resistant strains of the virus. Retention in care and viral suppression have been particularly challenging for minority populations leading to racial and ethnic disparities in HIV outcomes, including survival. Among people living with HIV infection in 2013, the percentage that was virally suppressed was only 51.5% among African Americans, 58.2% among Latinos, and 65.0% among whites. Our central hypothesis is that provider patient- centered care (PCC) factors interacting with dynamic patient psychosocial factors as well as neighborhood social determinants and medical case management site factors are influencing retention in care and viral suppression and thus contributing to health disparities. The objective of this application is to identify provider PCC factors that are moderating the effect of changes in individual characteristics on retention in care and viral suppression while considering neighborhood social determinants and medical case management site factors and to predict to what extent changes in PCC factors could improve HIV care retention and viral suppression and thus reduce health disparities. We will accomplish these objectives with a cohort study of people enrolled in the Miami-Dade County Ryan White Program 2019–2021. The Ryan White Program serves 52% of people living with HIV in the United States, in particular the medically underserved. To test our central hypothesis and achieve the objectives of this application, we propose the following four specific aims: 1) Using causal Bayesian networks, assess the moderating role of HIV provider PCC factors on the association between patient-level characteristics and retention in HIV care, viral suppression, and related health disparities cross- sectionally while accounting for neighborhood-level and medical case management site factors; 2) By means of dynamic causal Bayesian networks, assess the moderating role of HIV provider PCC factors on the association between longitudinal changes in patient-level characteristics and changes in retention in HIV care, viral suppression, and related health disparities; 3) Using dynamic causal Bayesian networks, estimate the magnitude of the expected improvement in retention in HIV care, viral suppression, and related health disparities, produced by changing provider PCC factors; and 4) Identify feasibility and acceptability issues related to potential interventions to address the most influential health disparities factors identified in aims 1–3 using expert interviews and focus group discussions with RWP providers, administrators, and patients. This research thus supports one of the Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-Related Research “cross-cutting” priorities to reduce disparities in treatment outcomes. NARRATIVE To address racial/ethnic disparities in HIV care and treatment, HIV providers and the health care system need to provide optimum support to all people living with HIV infection so that they can achieve viral suppression. Viral suppression not only benefits the individual, but it also benefits the community by decreasing the number of people who can transmit HIV infection and by preventing the transmission of HIV strains that are resistant to antiviral medications. In order to guide the development of interventions to optimize HIV care and treatment delivery, this project will identify HIV provider factors that help patients remain in care, take their medications, and be virally suppressed. 1",Influence of patient-centered HIV care on retention and viral suppression disparities,9857073,R01MD012421,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Buffers ', ' Client ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes ', ' Immunodeficiency Disorder ', ' Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Immunological Deficiency Syndromes ', ' hypoimmunity ', ' immune deficiency disorder ', ' immunodeficiency ', ' Incidence ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' PF4 Gene ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' SCYB4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Virus ', ' County ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Administrator ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Case Management ', ' Latino ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Funding ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' cultural competence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Anti-viral Drug Resistance ', ' Anti-viral Drug Resistant ', ' Antiviral Drug Resistance ', ' Antiviral Drug Resistant ', ' resistance to anti-viral ', ' resistance to antiviral ', ' resistant to anti-viral ', ' resistant to antiviral ', ' Viral Drug Resistance ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' health literacy ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' billing data ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effective intervention ', ' resistance strain ', ' resistant strain ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' individual patient ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' Bayesian Network ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,271246,0.21253727012868506
"Youth Services Navigation Intervention for HIV+ adolescents and young adults being released from incarceration: A randomized control trial Project Summary/Abstract The continuum of HIV care has forced new focus on the urgency to identify and effectively serve high-need, under-resourced, and often transient populations to facilitate their receiving the necessary ongoing care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress HIV RNA viral load (VL). Crucial target groups for improving care along the continuum are young (aged 16-25), sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations being released from jail settings. HIV prevalence among incarcerated youth living with HIV (YLWH) is three times that of the general population and one in seven of all HIV+ persons experience incarceration each year. HIV incidence, prevalence, and incarceration rates are higher for blacks and Latinos than for any other group – these disparities are especially prominent among youth. Furthermore, only an estimated 6% of HIV+ youth are virally suppressed, due to poor retention and adherence to ART. Existing linkage and retention services are insufficient to meet the acute needs of criminal justice-involved (CJI) HIV+ youth, particularly in the high-need period following release from incarceration. Moreover, because of their lack of experience, many youths may struggle to obtain needed services and stabilize their living conditions. Disparities in HIV continuum outcomes are inextricably linked to incarceration, substance use disorders (SUDs), homelessness, and mental health (MH) problems among YLWH. If HIV is to be controlled and the benefits of ART experienced broadly, the problems of CJI YLWH must be addressed with innovative, youth-, and sexual and gender minority (SGM)- sensitive approaches. We propose to enroll 240 CJI YLWH, aged 16-25, incarcerated in Los Angeles and Chicago jails and juvenile detention facilities. We will randomize participants to the YSN intervention (n=120) vs. a usual-care control group (n=120). The youth services navigators (YSNs) will assist with addressing immediate unmet needs such as housing, transportation, and food prior to clinical care and ongoing; will guide intervention participants to a range of community services to support progress along the continuum of HIV care; and will provide direct ART adherence support. The proposed study has two Primary Specific Aims: 1. Adapt an existing peer navigation intervention for adults to create a Youth Service Navigation (YSN) intervention sensitive to SGM culture that guides youth to needed services along the continuum of HIV care. This intervention combines medical, substance use and mental health care with comprehensive reentry support for CJI YLWH, aged 16-25 upon release from large county jails and juvenile detention systems; 2. Using a two-group RCT design, we will test the effectiveness of the new YSN, youth SGM-sensitive intervention among CJI YLWH aged 16-25, compared to controls offered standard referrals to services. We will evaluate the YSN Intervention's effect on post-incarceration linkage, retention, adherence, and viral suppression, as well as on SUDs, mental health, services utilization, and met needs. Secondary Aims: We will assess YSN's effects on recidivism, costs and potential cost-offset/effectiveness.   Public Health Relevance Crucial target groups for improving care along the Continuum of Care are young (aged 16-25) HIV+ sexual and gender minority youths with criminal-justice involvement (CJI) – a population that is poorly retained in HIV care. If HIV is to be controlled and the benefits of ART advances experienced broadly, the problems of CJI young people living with HIV must be addressed with innovative, youth-, and sexual and gender minority-sensitive approaches. The proposed Youth Services Navigation intervention will address this gap, testing a youth- focused approach that is adapted from our successful intervention with HIV+ CJI adults.",Youth Services Navigation Intervention for HIV+ adolescents and young adults being released from incarceration: A randomized control trial,9890791,R01MD011773,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Chicago ', ' Community Health Services ', ' Community Services ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Housing ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Los Angeles ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Persons ', ' Probability ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' viral RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' shelter ', ' shelter-housing ', ' Shelter facility ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' homeless ', ' unhoused ', ' Homelessness ', ' Gays ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' recidivism ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' contingency management ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Adherence ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' community re-entry ', ' community reentry ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' successful intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' trans-women ', ' transwoman ', ' transwomen ', ' transgender women ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' trial design ', ' navigator intervention ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' usual care control group ', ' usual care arm ', ' intervention participants ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,687127,0.09846469205675178
