"SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE ON HEALTH OF THE BLACK AGED This is a proposal for a scientific conference on the Health of the Black aged which is a pre-conference to:  ""Data for an Aging Population: Issues in Health, Research and Policy.""  The aged Black Population has special health problems.  Though morbidity and mortality rates of blacks have improved considerably in recent years, marked disparities with whites remain.  The margin objectives of this conference are to increase awareness of health issues of minorities and differences among sub-groups of the aged, as well as to report on original research that utilizes newly developed data sets.  The participants in the conference all have relevant experience and will bring a new perspective into research of the aged.

"BLACK WOMEN'S HEALTH--ESTABLISHING A RESEARCH AGENDA This is a proposal to plan a national working conference on establishing a research agenda on black women's health.  The conference will pull Together a highly select group of medical doctors, nurses, researchers, academicians, organizational leaders, church leaders, health practitioners, counselors, social workers, media specialists and hospital administrators from different geographical areas to analyze, discuss, and develop strategies for effective research on black women's health. Specifically, we propose to: convene a two day conference in either Newark, New Jersey or Washington, D.C.; invite eighteen experts in their field, to develop effectiveness research papers on heart disease/stroke and diabetes in black women; prepare for publication the conference papers -- which will be a major research document representing the best in the field.  According to the Task Force on Minority Health, the disparity in the death rate between blacks and whites is a compelling reason to focus attention on health effectiveness research. This conference is important and significant because black women are disproportionately affected by disease and illness in America, and if we are to reach any of the goals set forth in Healthy People 2000, we must design research which is culturally, race, gender and class specific.

"CULTURAL VALUES & HEALTH RESEARCH: A METHODS CONFERENCE The purpose of this conference is to provide health intervention researchers with increased sophistication in culturally sensitive research methodology in an effort to reduce the health disparities among Americans. The questions this conference will address are: (1) Given the heterogeneity that occurs within minority ethic groups in the United States, and given that minority groups live and function within the dominant culture; how can intervention researchers identify and assess the cultural values of their target group and determine the degree to which members hold the cultural values of their primary cultural group?  (2) How do intervention researchers account for cultural values in problem identification and conceptual or theoretical model selection, subject recruitment and participation, intervention development and design, and the measurement of concepts?  The conference conceptual framework consists of a matrix of cultural values (level of group centeredness, sense of control, time perception, and preferred behavioral patterns) and research methods (research problem conceptualization, subject recruitment, intervention development and implementation, and measurement).  Fifty mid- career health researchers will be invited.  The two and one-half day working conference, at the Wingspread Conference Center, will consist of opening and closing keynote addresses, expert speakers, participant poster presentations, small group working sessions, and a synthesis presentation of the ideas and recommendations of each working group.  Participants will read an anthology of relevant literature prior to the conference, and after the conference will receive a set of conference videotapes and a written copy of the synthesized ideas. Participants will be expected to use conference products in their own research and to share conference ideas with their colleagues.

"SMALL GRANT PROGRAM FOR CONFERENCE SUPPORT This conference is a partnership between the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and the Agency for Health Research and Quality. HCFA and AHRQ are sponsoring this conference with Southern University A&M College to: 1) enhance the capacity of HBCUs to work with HCFA and AHRQ, 2) share information about HCFA's HBCU Health Services Research Grant Program and AHRQ's opportunities for HBCUs, 3) acquire information about the HBCU Health Services Research Network, and 4) develop strategies to address the differences in health status and disparities provided to the African American community. The conference is planned to be held for September 28 and 29, 2000. There is a real need to have an opportunity to recognize HBCUs health service researchers for their accomplishments before a national audience. For no national organized bo1y provided this opportunity. Also, there is a- need to dispel the perception by many agencies and others that HBCUs lack the sophistication and resources to conduct quality research. This perception results in predominantly majority institutions receiving the majority of the research funding. It is felt that by showcasing health services researchers and their research at a national conference, the larger research community can gain an appreciation for and a better understanding of the research capabilities of HBCUs. The planned conference will assist significantly in full filling these unmet needs.

"African American Genealogy, Old Records/New Genetics   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Population genetics has transformed                                    ethnography. In particular, mtDNA has been used to trace human ancestries over       thousands of years. Some researchers have used mtDNA to examine the region or        tribe of origin of African-Americans who came to the western hemisphere during       the slave trade.                                                                                                                                                          The Atlantic trafficking in African slaves is a massive violation of human           rights that lasted for four hundred years until 1870. It created and fueled          persisting racism and disparities of health, education, and wealth. It               continues to affect African Americans' and European Americans' perceptions of        themselves, each other, and Africa.                                                                                                                                       There is intense interest in reconstructing the destroyed cultural identities        of individual African-Americans. Many community groups, families, academicians,      and local historical societies are working on this matter. Even so, there has        been little formal academic and community discussion of the feasibility or           desirability of this work.                                                                                                                                                The University of Minnesota's Center for Bioethics is proposing the first            national meeting to bring together the diverse groups working to reconstruct         African American genealogies and ancestries that were disrupted and destroyed        by the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The first day of the conference will discuss      the importance of disrupted ancestry to the African American community and           efforts to use traditional genealogical tools to reconstruct this ancestry. The      second day will focus on the feasibility of using voluntary DNA testing to           supplement traditional genealogy to enable African-Americans to identify             tribes, ethnic groups, or African regions of origin.                                                                                                                      The proposed effort would bring together scholars from a variety of                  disciplines, genetics and genealogical experts, historians, civil rights             leaders, and ethicists to examine the range of issues involved. The conference       would be nationally advertised to the genetics, civil rights, and bioethics          communities. After the conference, the P.I. will direct efforts to disseminate       this material to a variety of websites and undertake the publication of papers       on the proceedings of this collaboration. The publication of papers and              dissemination of material over the Internet will foster further public               discussion of conference topics.

"Biennial Symposium Series on Minorities and Cancer The Biennial Symposia on Minorities, the Medically Underserved & Cancer is the main program convened by the Intercultural Cancer Council (ICC). The purpose of this application is to seek funding for the 8th and 9th Biennial Symposia, as we have done for previous Symposia. However, as a result of the gratifying success of the Symposium series, and based on conversations with NCI staff, we are proposing to extend the normal grant period to four years in order to cover both the next two Symposia. This will facilitate maintaining continuity and will reinforce the positive impact of the conferences during the interim non-meeting years. It will also allow us to pursue longer-term needs assessment and outcomes measures. The Symposia are scheduled for February, 2002 and 2004, at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, DC. There is a disproportionate incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality among minorities and persons of low level income in the United States. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop knowledge and strategies to address this crisis with the leadership and full participation of the affected communities. The Biennial Symposia on Minorities, Medically Underserved & Cancer were initiated in 1987 to provide a multicultural forum for this purpose. The overall goals of the series in general and the upcoming 8d' and 9t' Symposia in particular are to: (1) exchange the latest scientific and treatment information and to share strategies for reducing the disproportionate incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality among minorities and the medically underserved in the United States; (2) enhance the competency of health care providers, laypersons and survivors in the areas of primary and secondary cancer prevention, early detection and treatment; and (3) promote culturally competent cancer care and services and ethnically balanced research. Additional specific aims of the 8d' Biennial Symposium will be to: (1) address topics newly identified through evaluation data from the 7h Biennial Symposium and the ongoing planning process of the ICC; and (2) provide a forum for federal agencies to identify and discuss their responses to the unequal burden of cancer among minority and medically underserved populations, e.g., the NCI Strategic Plan to Reduce Health Disparities, the Special Populations Networks for cancer Awareness Research and Training, and publication of the NCI's Response and Actions Related to the Report from tyre Institute of Medicine. The Intercultural Cancer Council along with a distinguished roster of advisors and consultants are designing a program that will involve representatives from the full continuum of cancer and minority health research, care, and policy development.  The Symposium format will include scientific presentation, panel discussions, posters and audience participation in Q&A sessions.  There will be a multimedia educational resources center and networking opportunities will be promoted.

"Race, Class and Health: Long and Healthy Lives for All The DC Primary Care Association (DCPCA) seeks funding for a research dissemination conference, ""Race, Class and Health: Long and Healthy Lives for All.""  The purpose of the event, lasting a day and a half (June 12/13, 2003) is twofold. First, the conference will improve local policymaking and clinical practices in a manner to decrease health disparities.  Second, it will increase awareness among national policymakers and the general public of disparities in health care access and health outcomes.  Because DC is a microcosm of disparities observed in urban areas across the country, and because it is the nation's capital, the conference is expected to have widespread applicability and to garner the attention of a national audience, including policymakers.  It will be planned by DCPCA management in collaboration with the DC Area Health Education Center (representing DC's academic health centers), Maryland and Connecticut PCAs, Families USA, a national nonprofit group advocating health care for all, and the federal Office of Minority Health.  An estimated 250 to 300 persons will attend.  There will be no cost to participants.  The event will be held at Howard University, a historically black institution in DC.  Locally, the conference is needed to reduce disparities in access to care and health status in both DC and Maryland, where the contrasts by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status are stark.  Nationally it is needed to raise awareness of health disparities, to motivate national leaders in government, business, and the nonprofit sector to reduce disparities, and to provide policy and clinical strategies for reducing disparities.  The core document on which the conference is based is the recently released report from the Institute of Medicine, ""Unequal Treatment,"" which summarizes research on health disparities, their causes, and interventions designed to reduce disparities.  The conference will offer both Policy and Clinical Tracks tailored to the needs of policymakers and clinicians.  In all, 16 sessions will be offered, including two plenary sessions, six Policy and six Clinical Track sessions, and concluding panel discussions for each track, including final recommendations and audience questions.   Evaluation forms will include Likert and open-ended items for each session and the conference as a whole.  In addition, a telephone survey will be completed 30 days after the conference to determine the applicability to participant worksites.

"Minority Faculty Development in Aging Research Confere DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed annual conferences, The Minority Faculty Development in Aging Research Conference Series, are designed to provide a forum for the scientific advancement of faculty development processes and tools developed by the NIA Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMARs), the NIA Pepper Centers, the NIA Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers, the NIA Roybal Centers; and other national center programs, such as EXCEED and EXPORT, that share common missions. The Series will be managed by the UCLA National RCMAR Coordinating Center (CC), which brings considerable expertise in faculty development programs and conference management. Four years of funding for the annual conferences is being requested, to span the current funding cycle of the RCMAR CC. The Planning Committee for the Series is chaired by James S. Jackson, PhD, a renowned leader in minority aging research and an experienced director in minority faculty development training. The annual conferences will be linked to the Gerontological  Society of America (GSA) Annual Scientific Meetings, and an established successful collaboration for two previous pre-conferences on minority aging research content.  Addressing health disparities is a national priority, and increasing the cadre of qualified minority faculty in aging research is seen as one important avenue to improve health disparities research.  The RCMARs, and other national programs, have been challenged to develop processes and tools to improve minority faculty in aging research by identifying and addressing the challenges and barriers for academic advancement and independent research success of minority and women faculty. This conference series provides an important forum for sharing across RCMARs and other NIA-sponsored programs with this common mission. Each annual conference will address a critical theme in minority faculty development, guided by scientific literature and the expertise and experience of the planning committee. The theme for the first one-day program in the series proposed for the 2003 GSA Pre-conference is ""Maximizing Minority Faculty Success through Mentoring"" to be held in San Diego, CA.

The purpose of this application is to seek funding for the 8th and 9th Biennial Symposia, as we have done for previous Symposia. However, as a result of the gratifying success of the Symposium series, and based on conversations with NCI staff, we are proposing to extend the normal grant period to four years in order to cover both the next two Symposia. This will facilitate maintaining continuity and will reinforce the positive impact of the conferences during the interim non-meeting years. It will also allow us to pursue longer-term needs assessment and outcomes measures. The Symposia are scheduled for February, 2002 and 2004, at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, DC. There is a disproportionate incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality among minorities and persons of low level income in the United States. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop knowledge and strategies to address this crisis with the leadership and full participation of the affected communities. The Biennial Symposia on Minorities, Medically Underserved & Cancer were initiated in 1987 to provide a multicultural forum for this purpose. The overall goals of the series in general and the upcoming 8d' and 9t' Symposia in particular are to: (1) exchange the latest scientific and treatment information and to share strategies for reducing the disproportionate incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality among minorities and the medically underserved in the United States; (2) enhance the competency of health care providers, laypersons and survivors in the areas of primary and secondary cancer prevention, early detection and treatment; and (3) promote culturally competent cancer care and services and ethnically balanced research. Additional specific aims of the 8d' Biennial Symposium will be to: (1) address topics newly identified through evaluation data from the 7h Biennial Symposium and the ongoing planning process of the ICC; and (2) provide a forum for federal agencies to identify and discuss their responses to the unequal burden of cancer among minority and medically underserved populations, e.g., the NCI Strategic Plan to Reduce Health Disparities, the Special Populations Networks for cancer Awareness Research and Training, and publication of the NCI's Response and Actions Related to the Report from tyre Institute of Medicine. The Intercultural Cancer Council along with a distinguished roster of advisors and consultants are designing a program that will involve representatives from the full continuum of cancer and minority health research, care, and policy development.  The Symposium format will include scientific presentation, panel discussions, posters and audience participation in Q&A sessions.  There will be a multimedia educational resources center and networking opportunities will be promoted. Edited proceedings of the Symposium and selected student abstracts and presentations will be published in professional journals.

"Conference of Specialized Centers in Neurosciences Description (provided by the applicant):  The University of Hawaii has been selected to be the host of the 3rd Annual SNRP Meeting to be held on May 27-29, 2003 in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The overall objectives of these SNRP annual meetings is to showcase the various research projects and programs within the different NINDS supported minority institutions, to introduce the young SNRP investigators to leaders of the neuroscience community, and to provide opportunities for SNRP investigators to present their work before a critical, yet supportive audience.  The select nature of this meeting will explicitly address the following aims and objectives:  1) To allow SNRP investigators the opportunity to present their research to their peers in a national setting; 2) To stimulate collaborations between SNRP investigators from different SNRP programs and to encourage exploration of new areas of study; 3) To discuss and disseminate information on the re-competition of the second series of SNRP awards; and 4) To invite distinguished neuroscientists to present their overview knowledge and cutting-edge progress in their areas of expertise.   This 3rd Annual SNRP Meeting will follow the basic format of the two previous Annual SNRP meetings.  In Day 1, the Program Directors and NINDS will discuss topics of interest such as the re-competition of the SNRP awards (AIM 3).  A concurrent session on ""Innovations in Neuroscience Techniques and Methods"" in Day 1 will facilitate AIM 2 for those SNRP investigators who are exploring new approaches to their research work.  The four major scientific sessions in Days 2 and 3 will address AIM 1 and AIM 2, and will have the quality of a select mini-symposium.  In addition, the poster sessions will be sorted to relate to the platform session.  Finally, to achieve AIM 4 of this proposal, each session (or subsection) will be presented and moderated by a distinguished neuroscientist, who will provide an expert overview of the area of study prior to the fifteen-minute presentations given by SNRP investigators.  This format was adopted, given our present uncertainties as to the number of presenters who will be attending this meeting; despite this, there is a great likelihood that the above aims and objectives will be achieved.

"Minority Faculty Development in Aging Research Confere DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed annual conferences, The Minority Faculty Development in Aging Research Conference Series, are designed to provide a forum for the scientific advancement of faculty development processes and tools developed by the NIA Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMARs), the NIA Pepper Centers, the NIA Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers, the NIA Roybal Centers; and other national center programs, such as EXCEED and EXPORT, that share common missions. The Series will be managed by the UCLA National RCMAR Coordinating Center (CC), which brings considerable expertise in faculty development programs and conference management. Four years of funding for the annual conferences is being requested, to span the current funding cycle of the RCMAR CC. The Planning Committee for the Series is chaired by James S. Jackson, PhD, a renowned leader in minority aging research and an experienced director in minority faculty development training. The annual conferences will be linked to the Gerontological  Society of America (GSA) Annual Scientific Meetings, and an established successful collaboration for two previous pre-conferences on minority aging research content.  Addressing health disparities is a national priority, and increasing the cadre of qualified minority faculty in aging research is seen as one important avenue to improve health disparities research.  The RCMARs, and other national programs, have been challenged to develop processes and tools to improve minority faculty in aging research by identifying and addressing the challenges and barriers for academic advancement and independent research success of minority and women faculty. This conference series provides an important forum for sharing across RCMARs and other NIA-sponsored programs with this common mission. Each annual conference will address a critical theme in minority faculty development, guided by scientific literature and the expertise and experience of the planning committee. The theme for the first one-day program in the series proposed for the 2003 GSA Pre-conference is ""Maximizing Minority Faculty Success through Mentoring"" to be held in San Diego, CA.

"Fourth Annual Primary Care and Prevention Conference    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The Morehouse School of Medicine and its National Center for Primary Care propose the convening of the Fourth Annual Primary Care and Prevention Conference. This conference, attended by physicians and other healthcare professionals from the Southeast for the last three years, would provide a continuing education opportunity to a national audience of medical providers and researchers. It is projected that during the next five years, conference activities and inter-conference activities would reach more than 3,000 conference participants and another 200,000 individuals through conference dissemination activities. For the Fourth Annual Primary Care and Prevention, MSM/NCPC proposes conference programming addressing the theme: Improving the Health of Your Patient, Your Practice, and Your Community.   The purpose of the conference and its activities is threefold: 1) to synthesize, summarize, and communicate research findings to a broad range of organizations and individuals who can make a difference in the health outcomes of their patients; 2) to develop national strategies for translating and disseminating research to public and private decision makers; and 3) to form collaborative partnerships that support local Initiatives and healthcare providers in reaching out to under-served communities.   The proposed three-day meeting to take place during October 25 - 27, 2004 in Atlanta, Georgia, will provide evidence-based primary care clinical updates, the latest thinking in public health, and opportunities for practitioners to interact with a wide range of other participants from community, academic, and other backgrounds. This combination of focus and purpose has become the hallmark of this primary care and prevention meeting and, according to evaluation reports, is the element that will make it different and useful to the 600 expected participants. The meeting agenda will offer sessions focused on health disparities related to gender, race and ethnicity, income and education, disability, residing in rural areas, and sexual orientation. Programming will also cover many of the 28 HP2010 focus areas including: access to health services; cancer; kidney disease; diabetes; disability and secondary conditions; heart disease; HIV; immunizations and infectious disease; maternal, infant, and child health; mental health; nutrition and overweight; physical activity and fitness; public health infrastructure; substance abuse; and vision and hearing.         ",Fourth Annual Primary Care and Prevention Conference,6851074,R13HS014748,"['disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' health care service ', ' patient care management ', ' information dissemination ', ' meeting /conference /symposium ', ' travel ', ' health care policy ', ' clinical research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",AHRQ,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R13,2004,175000,0.1687848782547185
"Third International Conference on Urban Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The 3rd International Conference in Urban Health will be held at Northeastern University in Boston, MA on October 20-23, 2002. The 1st and 2nd Conferences in Urban Health led to the assembly of a crossdisciplinary group of researchers and interventionists under the umbrella of an International Society for Urban Health, which includes epidemiologists, public policy professionals, public health practitioners, nurses, physicians, urban planners and sociologists. At the Institute on Urban Health Research at Northeastern University and the Center for Urban Epidemiologic Studies at the New York Academy of Medicine, we are increasingly struck by the contrast between the growing importance of urbanization and the lack of systematic study of the impact of urbanization on health. We aim to maintain the intellectual and practical momentum that started with the first conference that focused on the health of disadvantaged, inner city populations, in 2002 and the second conference that focused on the International Themes in Urban Health, specifically, services and urban systems, mental health, community based practices, policy and urban health and violence in 2003. The 3rd International Conference on Urban Health will address the setting of priorities in urban health, domestic and international public health agendas and building local public health infrastructures. Up to 800 attendees are expected at the conference, including members of the global research community whose interests encompass a wide variety of urban public health issues, such as conflict, trauma and mental health, demography, epidemiology, toxicology, environmental health, psychology, sociology, urban planning, and health policy who despite shared objective rarely collaborate, thus missing critical opportunities to present and disseminate innovative solutions to urban health issues. We intend to foster an international research group to collectively improve the understanding of the common health risks faced by urban residents, and to influence the development of effective public health interventions across the globe.

"Health Disparity in Obesity and Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Minorities in the United States experience higher prevalence of diabetes and obesity and have a higher mortality rate from these diseases than the rest of the population. For example, between 1980 and 2000, the age-adjusted prevalence of diagnosed diabetes was higher among blacks than whites and highest among black females. Between 1997 and 2000, age-adjusted prevalence of diagnosed diabetes for Hispanic males and females was similar to that of black males. A study published in the January 1,2003, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), reported that the prevalence of obesity among US adults climbed from 19.8 percent to 20.9 percent between 2000 and 2001. This study also found that African Americans had higher prevalence rates of both obesity (31.1 percent) and diagnosed diabetes (11.2 percent) than did members of other racial and ethnic groups.   These disparities are particularly great in minorities living in the south east region and require immediate attention. For example, in Alabama, age-adjusted diabetes prevalence was at least 50% higher in 2002 than in 1994 and it ranks number one among the other states.   In this project, we propose to organize and conduct a regional conference targeting the African-American communities, who make up the largest cohesive minority in the Southeast region. This conference will be coordinated and implemented by the Minority Health and Research Center (MHRC) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The overall goal of this conference is to bring together academic scientists and community physicians to share their experiences, discuss and identify areas of basic, clinical and community-based research that may lead to the elimination of this disparity. The conference will feature both didactic lectures and interactive presentations on possible reasons for health disparities.

"Current Challenges: Inter-Generational Family Relations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this proposed conference is to gather a multidisciplinary team of family and intergenerational experts to critically review the existing state of knowledge concerning changing multigenerational families, especially intra-family multigenerational relations and exchanges. The overall goal of the conference is to identify how best to maximize the effectiveness of multi-generation families to complement formal supports, such as health care, to meet the needs and maintain the health and well-being of all family members, especially the elderly.      We believe a conference highlighting both substantive and methodological challenges in multi-generation, intra-family relations is especially timely. Most research has been both inter-familial and cross-sectional in nature; and few have examined the influence of ethnicity, race and culture on intra-family intergenerational relations. This conference will facilitate an exchange among knowledgeable scholars from around the world to capitalize on recent investigations and innovative methodological strategies.      The conference is guided by four specific aims:      1. To identify and examine the benefits of intra-family versus inter-family intergenerational research.   2. To examine how intra-family inter-generational relations, especially the psychological and behavioral aspects of these relations, influence expectations concerning intergenerational social and economical exchanges with a particular emphasis on how these exchanges vary by generation, age, gender, race and ethnicity.   3. To explore new strategies for analyzing intra-family intergenerational data.   4. To develop specific research goals to maximize our knowledge base and optimize the health and wellbeing of all family members and address the goals delineated in the Healthy People 2010 report especially the reduction of health disparities.

"HEALTH INEQUALITIES ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed conference will explore life course and developmental perspectives on health inequalities.  The conference, which is proposed for June, 2004, will be organized by the Penn State Gerontology Center and co-sponsored by the Center for Human Development and Family Research in Diverse Contexts and the Social Science Research Consortium of Penn State. Co-chairs of the conference will be Leonard I. Pearlin, Graduate Professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland, and Steven H. Zarit, Professor of Human Development and Assistant Director of the Gerontology Center at Penn State University. The aim is for an agenda building conference that will use empirical findings, when available, to examine the life course conditions from childhood through adulthood that influence health disparities, as well as developing conceptual, theoretical and methodological frameworks for exploring these issues. A hallmark of the proposed program will be examination of available longitudinal data to address antecedents and cumulative effects of health disparities over the life course. Research aimed at illuminating the links between people's social and economic statuses and their health has tended to focus on contemporaneous health behaviors and life style dispositions. What is largely missing from the research at the present time is an understanding of the part played by earlier bio-psycho-social circumstances in the health status of people at mid- and late-life.  Health disparities that are observed at any point in the life course may have antecedents that surfaced at earlier points. That is, antecedent events or conditions might have delayed and/or cumulative effects that become most clearly reflected in health and health behavior at later times in the life course. We believe that our understanding of the underpinnings of health disparities would be advanced if, in addition to other approaches, the conditions that are linked to both status locations and health were viewed within a life course context. The proposed two-day conference will explore these issues from several perspectives, including conceptual and theoretical models for examining life course effects of disparities on health, as well as the role of specific factors such as race, gender and economic status. Major papers will be followed by formal discussions to extend and illuminate the presentations. Proceedings will be published in a special journal issue.

"Child Education, Health, and Welfare DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Human Potential and Public Policy (CHPPP) plans to hold a series of three conferences each spring (May) from 2004 through 2006, focusing on child education, health and welfare in the context of economic disadvantage. The primary objective of this conference series is to establish a regular means by which talented scholars in multiple social and behavioral science disciplines may convene to share their expertise on issues related to child development, family processes, poverty and public policy. The CHPPP's multidisciplinary approach is anchored in the social and behavioral sciences, with core representation in economics, developmental psychology, and sociology. Scholars within these disciplines persistently identify co-morbidity of problems associated with poverty as a persistent threat to well-being and to the likelihood of positive outcomes for low-income families and their children. The more specific goals of the conference series are to identify currently existing models, across the social and behavioral sciences, for coherently analyzing these multiply determined processes. To accomplish these goals, the CHPPP conference series will focus on three specific policy topics within the context of poverty and child education, health, and welfare as a means of grounding innovative, emerging theory and research that will be shared at each meeting. Each of these conferences will include high-caliber scholarship within the social and behavioral sciences, focusing specifically on the topics of the Federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, the upcoming reauthorization of substance abuse and mental health legislation, and the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996. The specific agenda for each year of the series is planned as follows: Year 1 (2004) - Poverty and educational equality: Developmental, Economic and Policy Perspectives on the Federal No Child Left Behind Act; Year 2 (2005) - Poverty, cumulative risk, and child well-being: Developmental, Economic and Policy perspectives on meeting the needs of ""hard to serve"" families through DHS/SAMHSA programs and initiatives; and Year 3 (2006) - Poverty, parental employment and parenting: Developmental, Economic, and Policy perspectives on TANF reauthorization, 10 years later.

"Nat'l.Conf/Prostate Cancer Disparity:Science, Hlth.Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this application is to seek support for a conference on ""Prostate Cancer Disparity: Science, Health Care, and Public Policy.""  The conference will address the science and health care of prostate cancer as a public health issue within the African American Community with a special emphasis on Washington DC.  Prostate cancer does not affect everyone equally, but imposes a heavier burden on African American men (AAM).  In AAM, the disease is more common, has an earlier age of onset, and tends to be more aggressive than in Caucasian men.  The conference will address the significance of earlier onset and aggressive behavior and the implications for screening, early diagnosis, staging, treatment and health care delivery.  Clinical studies have clearly shown that AAM have more advanced cancers at diagnosis and reduced survival rates compared with Caucasian men.  The conference will also address current prevention research and whether the research results will apply to AAM considering the differences in disease presentation. While the disparity has been investigated concerning social economic status and other demographic factors, the origin and significance of the aggressive disease in relation to survival disadvantage and public policies have not been fully addressed.  Reasons for these racial differences will be explicitly explored through risk factor analysis, epidemiological reviews, molecular genetic factors, and current public policies in early detection and treatment.  Moreover, lessons learned in the military about the prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment and clinical trial participation will be considered in relation to the civilian population.  An important objective for the conference will be a consideration of the clinical implications of aggressive disease and whether the current recommendations for screening, staging, and health care should be modified for specific racial/ethnic groups based on a consideration of the potential causative factors, biological behavior, and access to care.  An important issue relating to the disparity is education not only in diagnosis but also in treatment.  Through a special session, conference participants will review current public policies to determine whether these policies are addressing the disparity in a satisfactory manner.  Specifically, the costs, benefits, and access to screening in different populations will be considered within the disparity.  Conclusions and recommendations from the conference designed to reduce the disparity will be published.  The conference is planned of September, 21-22, 2004 in Washington, DC.

"Improving Qualitative and Mixed Methods Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Qualitative and Mixed Methods Research: Improving the Quality of Science and Addressing Health Disparities. While benefits of qualitative and mixed methods are increasingly recognized in biomedical and behavioral research, the full potential of applying such methods in studying aging and health disparities have not been fully realized. In response to the NIA priority areas to improve methodology and address health disparities, the proposed workshop will convene researchers with national leaders in qualitative and mixed methods research, as well as journal editors and funding agency representatives to explore how qualitative methodologies can best be designed, utilized and reported. The specific aims of the conference are to: 1) Explore rationales for using qualitative methods in studies of older adults and consider types of research goals optimally suited for such approaches; 2) Describe qualitative and mixed method research designs; 3) Discuss effective analytic strategies and related concepts, e.g., validity, reliability (trustworthiness) and triangulation; 4) Demonstrate effective integration of computer software into analyses; 5) Examine uses of qualitative methods for special populations, e.g., designing culturally appropriate research, providing deeper understanding of health disparities, enhancing participation of diverse groups in research (e.g., race, gender, ethnicity and disability) and developing a more authentic awareness of the lived experiences of diverse older populations; 6) Identify essential elements of a credible manuscript appropriate for publication in major peer reviewed journals; 7) Provide interaction with journal editors and representatives of funding organizations. This conference addresses a critical and previously unmet need for training regarding the application of qualitative methods in aging research. As a pre-conference workshop to the Gerontological Society of America 2004 annual meeting in Washington, DC, the conference will attract a key group of 75-100 national researchers to improve the strategies and benefits of qualitative and mixed methods research.

"Conference on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is being increasingly used and considered important for the health of many Americans, yet it is vastly underutilized for end-of-life care and for underserved and minority populations. The purpose of the proposed conference is to bring together experts in end-of-life care, CAM, and healthcare disparities to: 1) comprehensively evaluate how CAM approaches can be incorporated fully into conventional end-of-life care; 2) propose effective approaches for delivering these services to underserved and minority populations, and 3) develop a research agenda for clinical studies. The conference objectives regarding CAM, end-of-life care, and health disparities are to: 1) Identify current CAM utilization and practice in conventional end-of-life care. 2) Identify disparities in underserved/minority populations and propose steps to eliminate disparities. 3) Present and evaluate current research on the safety and efficacy of CAM interventions. 4) Identify outcome measures suitable for assessing the effectiveness of CAM interventions. 5) Examine evidence for improving quality of life for palliative care and hospice patients utilizing CAM. 6) Highlight the legal, logistical and professional barriers to incorporating CAM in end-of-life care. 7) Establish an agenda for guiding future research on current and novel CAM approaches for end-of-life care and disseminate this nationally to relevant healthcare and research institutions. 8) Identify resources and strategies for rapidly implementing into conventional end-of-life care CAM approaches proven to be effective by appropriately designed, carefully controlled clinical studies. Members of the organizing committee are from notable institutions including Henry Ford Health System, University of Michigan, Wayne State University, Oakland University, and Eastern Michigan University. The committee has clinical research expertise in end-of-life care and CAM, as well as in healthcare disparities. The overall goal of the organizers is to hold the first several large annual conferences (300 attendees expected this year) that will raise national awareness for the importance of creating the most effective and compassionate integrative end-of-life care. This integrative care will incorporate the best practices of conventional medicine with those CAM therapies that are proven effective. As integrative medicine is created, there will be no distinction in medicine between conventional care and CAM, and the best available interventions will allow for dignity and peace for all people at the end of life.

"Cancer Disparities: Biennial Symposia & Education Forums    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Specific Aims.  This application seeks conference grant funding to the Chronic Disease Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine to support a series of scientific dissemination conferences sponsored with the Intercultural Cancer Council (ICC) over the years 2005-2009.  Specific Aims are to (1) convene the 10th and 11th Biennial Symposia; (2) convene semi-annual national Educational Forum meetings, scheduled between the Biennial Symposia; (3) utilize the ICC National Network to follow-up and reinforce accomplishments of the Biennial Symposia and Educational Forum meetings; and (4) utilize the ICC National Network to disseminate evidence based research results and funding opportunities related to cancer in minority and medically underserved populations.  Background and Significance.  There is a disproportionate incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality among minorities and persons of low-level income in the United States. To address this unequal burden of cancer, the Biennial Symposia and national Educational Forum meetings represent a tremendous resource and opportunity for professional development and networking as well as dissemination of evidence based research and best practices.  Furthermore, the communication channel is two-way, providing an opportunity for NCI and other federal agencies to hear from representatives of grass-roots organizations and local agencies.  The Biennial Symposium and Educational Forum meetings are thus excellent examples of the public-private, partnerships that will be necessary to properly address cancer disparities.  Methods. The Biennial Symposia on Minorities, the  Medically Underserved & Cancer and semiannual ICC Educational Forum meetings include formal presentations, panel discussions, question and answer sessions, posters, networking/caucusing opportunities, and sessions on national cancer policy.  These conferences are planned and designed to (1) exchange the latest scientific and treatment information and share strategies for reducing the disproportionate incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality among minorities and the medically underserved in the United States; (2) enhance the competency of health care providers, laypersons and survivors in the areas of primary and secondary cancer prevention, early detection and treatment; (3) promote culturally competent cancer care and services and ethnically balanced research; (4) address topics newly identified through evaluation data from the previous Biennial Symposia and ICC Educational Forum meetings as well as the ongoing ICC planning process; and (5) provide a forum for federal agencies such as NCI to share their strategies and responses to the unequal burden of cancer among minority and medically underserved populations.  Evaluation.  Traditional hard copy evaluation forms are completed onsite at the Symposium and Educational Forum meetings.  As of 2004, we are also using online electronic survey software which is providing response rates of > 50%.  In addition, the semi-annual Educational Forum meetings are purposefully scheduled in the interim between Biennial Symposia so that the activities and results of the preceding meeting can be assessed and utilized in the planning process for future meetings.

"Conference on Interactions between Poverty and HIV/AIDS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Conference on Interactions between Poverty and HIV/AIDS. This applicant is requesting funding to provide partial support for a conference on the interactions between poverty and HIV/AIDS. The conference will be held at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, in late 2005. The conference is being organized by the Panel on Population and Poverty of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population. Funds will be used to bring six African researchers to participate in the conference, selected through an open international call for papers.  The conference will focus on causal connections between HIV/AIDS and poverty that run in both directions. Poverty may have a direct impact on behaviors underlying the incidence of HIV/AIDS as well as behaviors mediating the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. At the same time, the disability, medical expenses, and mortality resulting from the disease may push some households into poverty. The conference will give particular attention to the use of household survey data, especially longitudinal survey data, to analyze the dynamics of HIV/AIDS and poverty. A number of longitudinal data collection projects with content related to both HIV/AIDS and socioeconomic status have recently begun to produce the kind of data that is necessary to develop a clear picture of these dynamics. While one goal of the conference will be highlighting research using longitudinal household survey data, the conference organizers will also welcome submissions by researchers using other methodologies, such as qualitative research. In addition to bringing together researchers on the cutting edge of research in this area, another goal of the conference will be to increase awareness of data sets that are available to researchers and to increase capacity in the collection and analysis of household survey data. The conference will include training workshops targeted at junior African researchers. The workshops will focus on the statistical analysis of survey data, discussion of available data sets, and discussion of appropriate research designs for analyzing the causal connections between HIV/AIDS and poverty, and the impact of programs targeted at these connections.

"Disparities-Social Change: Making Difference the Ground Health Care for All (HCFA) is Massachusetts' leading nonprofit, membership-based, consumer health policy and advocacy organization, founded in 1985 on the belief that all people should have access to health care. The proposed conference ""Health Disparities in America: Community Participation in Policy Dialogues"" is designed to be a knowledge transfer event. We believe that community organizations have much to offer policy makers in the continuing dialog over the pressing issue of disparities in health care and health outcomes for minority populations. Our conference will be designed to provide community organizations from all 6 New England states with the latest information about health disparities and the many recent efforts to narrow the gap in health outcomes. Equipped with this knowledge, we believe that community organizations can effectively participate in policy discussions in their state and communities about next steps in the effort to reduce disparities. The specific aims of the conference are to: 1) Provide up-to-date information about recent research and reports on disparities in health care outcomes and on effort to reduce those disparities. The conference will feature presentations on AHRQ's National Disparities Report Card, the final report of the Massachusetts Special Commission on Racial and Ethnic Health Care Disparities, and the report on racial disparities in the City of Boston that was recently released by the Mayor's Task Force. 2) Educate participants on how to identify and understand health disparities that exist within the communities they serve. Information and research techniques will be presented across topic areas (asthma, diabetes, etc.) across regions (urban, rural, etc.) and across disciplines (housing, employment, etc.) 3) Provide community groups from each state with the opportunity to network with individuals from other states and with individuals involved in health disparities work in their own state. Participants will have time to share experiences and initiate discussions on how to facilitate consumer participation in public policy discussions about health disparities issues. HCFA will draw on its own history of involvement in public policy development in Massachusetts to suggest methods for bringing meaningful community and health care consumer involvement to the policy making process.

"Latino Cancer Disparities Conference: Closing the Gap DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer Disparities and unequal burden of cancer among minority populations is one of the most significant health care challenges facing this nation.  The Hispanic/Latino population is the fastest growing demographic group in the United States, yet the health care challenges faced by this group are just beginning to be investigated.  Nevertheless, data are rapidly accumulating indicating that significant disparities exist in the incidence of certain cancers, in access to quality health care, in treatment, and in outcomes.  This conference will address these problems by critically assessing cancer epidemiology and demographics; clinical issues of age and stage at diagnosis; risk factors; cultural, socioeconomic and language barriers to successful cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment; psychosocial aspects of interventional education and patient navigation; and public policy issues.  The conference will address the ""Healthy People 2010"" focus areas of Cancer, Educational and Community-Based Programs, and Tobacco Use.  The conference will include cancer public health research, education, and policy development in managed care with the goal of addressing how to close the cancer gap in the Hispanic/Latino community.       In connection with the GWU Hospital and the GW Medical Faculty Associates, the GW Cancer Institute provides for collaboration in the study, diagnosis and treatment of cancer.  Our mission is to provide a confluence of groundbreaking biomedical and clinical research, high quality educational programs, outstanding patient care and effective outreach to the entire Metropolitan Washington community. GW is centrally located in the District of Columbia, which is ranked highest in overall cancer mortality in the nation.  All patients are welcome, and most types of cancer are studied and treated here at GW; however, from a research and outreach perspective our Institute seeks to further understand why certain cancers are so predominate in our community.  Many of our programs are focused on studying the unequal burden of cancer among vulnerable minority populations.  These include but are not limited to Breast, Lung, Prostate and Gastrointestinal/ Colorectal cancer.

"Fourth Annual Primary Care and Prevention Conference    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The Morehouse School of Medicine and its National Center for Primary Care propose the convening of the Fourth Annual Primary Care and Prevention Conference. This conference, attended by physicians and other healthcare professionals from the Southeast for the last three years, would provide a continuing education opportunity to a national audience of medical providers and researchers. It is projected that during the next five years, conference activities and inter-conference activities would reach more than 3,000 conference participants and another 200,000 individuals through conference dissemination activities. For the Fourth Annual Primary Care and Prevention, MSM/NCPC proposes conference programming addressing the theme: Improving the Health of Your Patient, Your Practice, and Your Community.   The purpose of the conference and its activities is threefold: 1) to synthesize, summarize, and communicate research findings to a broad range of organizations and individuals who can make a difference in the health outcomes of their patients; 2) to develop national strategies for translating and disseminating research to public and private decision makers; and 3) to form collaborative partnerships that support local Initiatives and healthcare providers in reaching out to under-served communities.   The proposed three-day meeting to take place during October 25 - 27, 2004 in Atlanta, Georgia, will provide evidence-based primary care clinical updates, the latest thinking in public health, and opportunities for practitioners to interact with a wide range of other participants from community, academic, and other backgrounds. This combination of focus and purpose has become the hallmark of this primary care and prevention meeting and, according to evaluation reports, is the element that will make it different and useful to the 600 expected participants. The meeting agenda will offer sessions focused on health disparities related to gender, race and ethnicity, income and education, disability, residing in rural areas, and sexual orientation. Programming will also cover many of the 28 HP2010 focus areas including: access to health services; cancer; kidney disease; diabetes; disability and secondary conditions; heart disease; HIV; immunizations and infectious disease; maternal, infant, and child health; mental health; nutrition and overweight; physical activity and fitness; public health infrastructure; substance abuse; and vision and hearing.         ",Fourth Annual Primary Care and Prevention Conference,7126825,R13HS014748,"['disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' health care service ', ' patient care management ', ' information dissemination ', ' meeting /conference /symposium ', ' travel ', ' health care policy ', ' clinical research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",AHRQ,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R13,2006,160000,0.1687848782547185
"Parks, Recreation, Public Health: Frameworks for Promoting Physical Activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The Cooper Institute established an annual conference series in 1997 with the express goal of stimulating scientific research related to all aspects of physical activity, other lifestyle factors, and public health. Each year a specific topic is identified, and leading scientific experts in that field present lectures to summarize the state of research on the topic and the gaps that exist in the knowledge base, and to formulate recommendations for research and practice. The 2006 conference will be the 9th in The Cooper Institute Conference Series. The goal of the 2006 meeting is to advance the cross-disciplines of public health and parks and recreation. By providing a forum to discuss scientific and practice issues, researchers and practitioners will establish a framework for strengthening collaboration between these disciplines. Objectives of this conference are to 1) articulate how public health and recreation partnerships should approach research and interventions that address chronic disease; 2) create common frameworks where evidence has been established, where evidence is emerging, and where evidence is lacking that can guide public health and recreation policy; and 3) specify transdisciplinary opportunities related to a) building consensus of specific definitions of concepts, b) encouraging continued transdisciplinary theory development, c) continuing to forge this relationship as well as involve others with a stake in a more active population, and d) increasing the understanding of cross-field methodology. The specific aim of the proposed conference is to bring together scientists and practitioners from diverse fields such as sports medicine, public health, social science, parks and recreation, urban planning, and economic development to promote further dialogue and collaborate on approaches to address chronic disease through our nation's recreational resources. Topical areas will include historical context between recreation and public health, epidemiology and measurement, disparities and diversity, policy and economics, and translation and application.             ","Parks, Recreation, Public Health: Frameworks for Promoting Physical Activity",7225165,R13HL087687,"['body physical activity ', ' public health ', ' meeting /conference /symposium ', ' recreation ', ' travel ', ' ']",NHLBI,COOPER INSTITUTE,R13,2006,10000,0.1469034453807495
"Child Education, Health, and Welfare DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Human Potential and Public Policy (CHPPP) plans to hold a series of three conferences each spring (May) from 2004 through 2006, focusing on child education, health and welfare in the context of economic disadvantage. The primary objective of this conference series is to establish a regular means by which talented scholars in multiple social and behavioral science disciplines may convene to share their expertise on issues related to child development, family processes, poverty and public policy. The CHPPP's multidisciplinary approach is anchored in the social and behavioral sciences, with core representation in economics, developmental psychology, and sociology. Scholars within these disciplines persistently identify co-morbidity of problems associated with poverty as a persistent threat to well-being and to the likelihood of positive outcomes for low-income families and their children. The more specific goals of the conference series are to identify currently existing models, across the social and behavioral sciences, for coherently analyzing these multiply determined processes. To accomplish these goals, the CHPPP conference series will focus on three specific policy topics within the context of poverty and child education, health, and welfare as a means of grounding innovative, emerging theory and research that will be shared at each meeting. Each of these conferences will include high-caliber scholarship within the social and behavioral sciences, focusing specifically on the topics of the Federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, the upcoming reauthorization of substance abuse and mental health legislation, and the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996. The specific agenda for each year of the series is planned as follows: Year 1 (2004) - Poverty and educational equality: Developmental, Economic and Policy Perspectives on the Federal No Child Left Behind Act; Year 2 (2005) - Poverty, cumulative risk, and child well-being: Developmental, Economic and Policy perspectives on meeting the needs of ""hard to serve"" families through DHS/SAMHSA programs and initiatives; and Year 3 (2006) - Poverty, parental employment and parenting: Developmental, Economic, and Policy perspectives on TANF reauthorization, 10 years later.

"Ovarian Cancer National Alliance's 9th Annual Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Ovarian Cancer National Alliance (the Alliance) is a survivor-led, national organization that brings together ovarian cancer activists, women's health advocates, health care providers and researchers in the battle against ovarian cancer.  The Alliance's Ninth Annual Conference will be held September 6 - September 9, 2006 at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, DC.  Over 350 participants, representing more than half of the states, are expected to attend.  The majority will be ovarian cancer survivors, family members, community activists and health care professionals.  All are motivated by a desire to learn more about the new developments in ovarian cancer research and treatments, and a commitment to fight for more resources to battle this disease. The three and a half day conference emphasizes five tracks important to individual survivors and t the national ovarian cancer awareness movement: medical/clinical, public education and awareness, survivorship, policy and advocacy, and constituency building.       The objective of the Alliance's 2006 annual conference is twofold:  first, to strengthen the capacity of participating organizations and individuals to carry out public education and advocacy activities in their own communities; and second to empower women with ovarian cancer (both newly diagnosed, recurrent, and long term survivors) to be fully informed as to how best to partner with their physicians to insure their own survival and quality of life.  Through presentations and workshops on the latest developments in research, key survivorship issues, and model education and organizing programs, participants will develop strategies to fight this disease at the local, state and national level and enhance their ability to focus the attention of public health officials, health care professionals, public policy makers and the media on ovarian cancer.  As a result, growing numbers of women and health care providers across the country will be better able to monitor women at heightened risk, recognize the disease in early stages, refer women for optimum care, address disparities in treatment in underserved populations and advocate for more research - all critical components of improving women's survival from ovarian cancer.             ",Ovarian Cancer National Alliance's 9th Annual Conference,7172019,R13CA124382,"['neoplasm /cancer education ', ' meeting /conference /symposium ', ' ovary neoplasm ', ' travel ', ' ']",NCI,OVARIAN CANCER NATIONAL ALLIANCE,R13,2006,5000,0.09352256942327197
"Cancer Disparities: Biennial Symposia & Education Forums This application seeks conference grant funding to the Chronic Disease Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine to support a series of scientific dissemination conferences sponsored with the Intercultural Cancer Council (ICC) over the years 2005-2009.  Specific Aims are to (1) convene the 10th and 11th Biennial Symposia; (2) convene semi-annual national Educational Forum meetings, scheduled between the Biennial Symposia; (3) utilize the ICC National Network to follow-up and reinforce accomplishments of the Biennial Symposia and Educational Forum meetings; and (4) utilize the ICC National Network to disseminate evidence based research results and funding opportunities related to cancer in minority and medically underserved populations.  Background and Significance.  There is a disproportionate incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality among minorities and persons of low-level income in the United States. To address this unequal burden of cancer, the Biennial Symposia and national Educational Forum meetings represent a tremendous resource and opportunity for professional development and networking as well as dissemination of evidence based research and best practices.  Furthermore, the communication channel is two-way, providing an opportunity for NCI and other federal agencies to hear from representatives of grass-roots organizations and local agencies.  The Biennial Symposium and Educational Forum meetings are thus excellent examples of the public-private, partnerships that will be necessary to properly address cancer disparities.  Methods. The Biennial Symposia on Minorities, the  Medically Underserved & Cancer and semiannual ICC Educational Forum meetings include formal presentations, panel discussions, question and answer sessions, posters, networking/caucusing opportunities, and sessions on national cancer policy.  These conferences are planned and designed to (1) exchange the latest scientific and treatment information and share strategies for reducing the disproportionate incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality among minorities and the medically underserved in the United States; (2) enhance the competency of health care providers, laypersons and survivors in the areas of primary and secondary cancer prevention, early detection and treatment; (3) promote culturally competent cancer care and services and ethnically balanced research; (4) address topics newly identified through evaluation data from the previous Biennial Symposia and ICC Educational Forum meetings as well as the ongoing ICC planning process; and (5) provide a forum for federal agencies such as NCI to share their strategies and responses to the unequal burden of cancer among minority and medically underserved populations.  Evaluation.  Traditional hard copy evaluation forms are completed onsite at the Symposium and Educational Forum meetings.  As of 2004, we are also using online electronic survey software which is providing response rates of > 50%.  In addition, the semi-annual Educational Forum meetings are purposefully scheduled in the interim between Biennial Symposia so that the activities and results of the preceding meeting can be assessed and utilized in the planning process for future meetings.

"Fourth Annual Primary Care and Prevention Conference    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The Morehouse School of Medicine and its National Center for Primary Care propose the convening of the Fourth Annual Primary Care and Prevention Conference. This conference, attended by physicians and other healthcare professionals from the Southeast for the last three years, would provide a continuing education opportunity to a national audience of medical providers and researchers. It is projected that during the next five years, conference activities and inter-conference activities would reach more than 3,000 conference participants and another 200,000 individuals through conference dissemination activities. For the Fourth Annual Primary Care and Prevention, MSM/NCPC proposes conference programming addressing the theme: Improving the Health of Your Patient, Your Practice, and Your Community.   The purpose of the conference and its activities is threefold: 1) to synthesize, summarize, and communicate research findings to a broad range of organizations and individuals who can make a difference in the health outcomes of their patients; 2) to develop national strategies for translating and disseminating research to public and private decision makers; and 3) to form collaborative partnerships that support local Initiatives and healthcare providers in reaching out to under-served communities.   The proposed three-day meeting to take place during October 25 - 27, 2004 in Atlanta, Georgia, will provide evidence-based primary care clinical updates, the latest thinking in public health, and opportunities for practitioners to interact with a wide range of other participants from community, academic, and other backgrounds. This combination of focus and purpose has become the hallmark of this primary care and prevention meeting and, according to evaluation reports, is the element that will make it different and useful to the 600 expected participants. The meeting agenda will offer sessions focused on health disparities related to gender, race and ethnicity, income and education, disability, residing in rural areas, and sexual orientation. Programming will also cover many of the 28 HP2010 focus areas including: access to health services; cancer; kidney disease; diabetes; disability and secondary conditions; heart disease; HIV; immunizations and infectious disease; maternal, infant, and child health; mental health; nutrition and overweight; physical activity and fitness; public health infrastructure; substance abuse; and vision and hearing.         ",Fourth Annual Primary Care and Prevention Conference,7292689,R13HS014748,[''],AHRQ,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R13,2007,150000,0.1687848782547185
"HEALing Our Underserved Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The health of Americans has improved over the past few decades, but not all Americans have benefited equally. Many ethnic and racial groups have not shared in the advances in health outcomes and health care. The metropolitan Atlanta area in particular has more than 50% of the population being classified as minority status. To understand the causes and factors of these inequalities, the Health Education, Assessment and Leadership (H.E.A.L.) coalition will convene to elucidate these issues. The initial phase of the HEAL coalition will function to establish a biannual meeting to initiate discourse and coordinate community (CO) organizations (civic, health, religious, spiritual), academic institutions and the lay public to address the health issues of minorities in the metropolitan Atlanta area. These conferences will create alliances between COs, academic institutions and the lay public. The HEAL coalition will function to assess the needs and assets of the Atlanta community by including these individual groups to initiate an integrated approach to healthcare in underserved communities. From these conferences, baseline data on health disparity in the Atlanta area will be collected. Also, a website indicating the assets of the community will be established and linked to the websites of the participants. In the second phase of the inception of HEAL, a series of working conferences to continue the progression of the initiative will be launched. In addition, a complete curricular program will be created by the collaboration of the participants (COs, academic institutions and lay public) to address these health disparities. In the third phase, the HEAL coalition will institute the complete curricular program within COs. Funding is requested for the establishment of the initial conference.            ",HEALing Our Underserved Communities,7334669,R13MD002704,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Area ', ' Healed ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' programs ', ' Work ', ' American ', ' metropolitan ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Communities ', ' healing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' community organizations ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R13,2007,7000,0.12009643261648618

"Tribal Healing and Wellness Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to the 2000 census, there are approximately 93,000 American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) people in the state of Washington (1.6% of the total population). AIAN individuals and communities are distributed across the state with communities ranging from small, rural groups to urban, inter-Tribal ones. Due to complex relationships between Tribes and local, state, and federal agencies, healthcare may be provided either by the Tribe, local service providers, the state, an Indian Health Service facility, a regional Native Health Board, or by some combination of the above. Because of this, there is very little empirical data about health disparities as they are experienced by AIAN communities, especially in regards to mental health and substance abuse services. Little is also known about the many community-developed programs that often incorporate Tribal values, practices, and beliefs, and have anecdotal evidence of effectiveness. Finally, a lack of funding and overburdened resources result in decreased access to appropriate training for many mental health and substance abuse service providers working with Tribal communities. Because of this, we are proposing to hold a 1 1/2 day long Washington State Tribal Healing and Wellness Conference in March 2007 that would bring together representatives from the 29 federally recognized Tribes, other AIAN agencies, and urban AIAN communities. The conference will include 2 panels with expertise in the areas of health disparities, substance abuse, and mental health issues among AIAN populations. Additionally, breakout sessions will be facilitated by panel members and address the five objectives listed below. The primary objectives of the conference, which will be held on the Port Madison Reservation located across Elliot Bay from Seattle, will be to: 1) identify substance abuse and mental health disparity issues of greatest concern to urban, rural, and reservation Tribal communities; 2) identify best practices that have been developed in Tribal communities to address such issues but that may be lacking strong empirical evidence; 3) educate Tribal communities and researchers by providing expert speakers who can address health issues of concern to Tribal communities; 4) provide specific clinical skills for working with AIAN communities regarding mental health and substance abuse; and 5) provide an opportunity for Tribal organizations to connect and collaborate with researchers and research institutions, and to network with other Tribal communities. A conference report will document identified health issues of concern to Tribal communities, evidence-based approaches currently used to address these needs, and other community-based interventions that appear promising but are in need of evaluation. This report will set the agenda for future conferences, and will help develop a research agenda for collaborative, community-based research addressing identified areas of health disparity.           ",Tribal Healing and Wellness Conference,7273397,R13MD002247,"['Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Reservations ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Healed ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' programs ', ' Tribes ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' day ', ' Complex ', ' Belief ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Reporting ', ' emotional abuse ', ' mental abuse ', ' Psychological abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Censuses ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' United States Indian Health Service ', ' Indian Health Service ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Skills ', ' Communities ', ' healing ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' tribal organization ', ' tribal board ', ' urban native american ', ' urban American Indian ', ' Population ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R13,2007,50000,-0.012123903476164934

"Diabetes Health Disparities:  Determinants, Prevention, Treatment, and Policy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Diabetes disproportionately affects certain ethnic groups such as African-Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. The reasons for these inequalities and strategies for reducing the disparities are incompletely understood. Evidence suggests that the causes are multifactorial and that solutions will require multi-level interventions that target individuals, communities, health systems, and public policy at the local, state, and national level. The objective of the proposed conference (""Diabetes Health Disparities: Determinants, Prevention, Treatment, and Policy"") is to bring together experts with different perspectives in an effort to better understand disparities in diabetes and to guide future research activities. Support is requested to partially underwrite the costs of the conference to be held November 12-13, 2007, in Nashville, TN. The goals of this conference are: 1) assemble leading researchers from across the nation as speakers to stimulate an exchange of ideas leading to new research partnerships and insights into the observed problems; b) encourage students in the clinical, basic, and social sciences to attend, submit posters, take part in the discussions, and make research plans for the future; and 3) attract underrepresented minority program participants and registrants to take part in this important scientific endeavor. This meeting will be a unique blend of informality and interactive   discussion characteristic of Gordon conferences. A concerted effort will be made to attract junior investigators and those considered underrepresented in biomedical fields, such as women and ethnic minorities. Travel awards will be provided to aid in this effort. The conference is being organized by Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Meharry Medical College, the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance, and the Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center (DRTC). The Vanderbilt DRTC is one of five NIH-funded DRTCs that each has a Prevention and Control Core. For the proposed conference, investigators in the Vanderbilt Prevention/Control Core will work collaboratively with investigators at the other four NIH-funded DRTCs in the country (University of Chicago, University of Michigan, Washington University, Albert Einstein), and the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance to organize and plan the proposed conference.

"Cancer Disparities: Biennial Symposia & Education Forums This application seeks conference grant funding to the Chronic Disease Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine to support a series of scientific dissemination conferences sponsored with the Intercultural Cancer Council (ICC) over the years 2005-2009.  Specific Aims are to (1) convene the 10th and 11th Biennial Symposia; (2) convene semi-annual national Educational Forum meetings, scheduled between the Biennial Symposia; (3) utilize the ICC National Network to follow-up and reinforce accomplishments of the Biennial Symposia and Educational Forum meetings; and (4) utilize the ICC National Network to disseminate evidence based research results and funding opportunities related to cancer in minority and medically underserved populations.  Background and Significance.  There is a disproportionate incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality among minorities and persons of low-level income in the United States. To address this unequal burden of cancer, the Biennial Symposia and national Educational Forum meetings represent a tremendous resource and opportunity for professional development and networking as well as dissemination of evidence based research and best practices.  Furthermore, the communication channel is two-way, providing an opportunity for NCI and other federal agencies to hear from representatives of grass-roots organizations and local agencies.  The Biennial Symposium and Educational Forum meetings are thus excellent examples of the public-private, partnerships that will be necessary to properly address cancer disparities.  Methods. The Biennial Symposia on Minorities, the  Medically Underserved & Cancer and semiannual ICC Educational Forum meetings include formal presentations, panel discussions, question and answer sessions, posters, networking/caucusing opportunities, and sessions on national cancer policy.  These conferences are planned and designed to (1) exchange the latest scientific and treatment information and share strategies for reducing the disproportionate incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality among minorities and the medically underserved in the United States; (2) enhance the competency of health care providers, laypersons and survivors in the areas of primary and secondary cancer prevention, early detection and treatment; (3) promote culturally competent cancer care and services and ethnically balanced research; (4) address topics newly identified through evaluation data from the previous Biennial Symposia and ICC Educational Forum meetings as well as the ongoing ICC planning process; and (5) provide a forum for federal agencies such as NCI to share their strategies and responses to the unequal burden of cancer among minority and medically underserved populations.  Evaluation.  Traditional hard copy evaluation forms are completed onsite at the Symposium and Educational Forum meetings.  As of 2004, we are also using online electronic survey software which is providing response rates of > 50%.  In addition, the semi-annual Educational Forum meetings are purposefully scheduled in the interim between Biennial Symposia so that the activities and results of the preceding meeting can be assessed and utilized in the planning process for future meetings.

"Starting Early: Closing the Gap on Child Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): STARTING EARLY: CLOSING THE GAP ON CHILD HEALTH DISPARITIES: The DC-Baltimore Research Center on Child Health Disparities (Center) was formed as collaboration between the Howard University Department of Pediatrics and Child Health and Children's National Medical Center with the participation of Johns Hopkins University and the District of Columbia Department of Health. The Center targets health disparities in one of the priority populations-children. The lack of research on child health disparities is disturbing in light of the increasing numbers of minority children in the U.S. Given the dramatic increases in low-income children of color in the U.S., it is likely that health disparities will increase, rather than decrease, over time. There is a need for researchers, scholars, and policy makers in this area to collaborate, communicate, and share information and ideas as to how to reduce the disparities in this population. The broad, long-term objectives of this proposed project are to reduce health disparities in this population, and ultimately, the adult population. The specific aims of the proposed project are to hold a conference to facilitate dialogue and stimulate the development of new perspectives and research strategies in this area. The Center seeks funding to host a conference and convene an invited group of researchers in (1) defining the ""state of the art"" in child health disparities research; (2) identifying gaps in research on child health disparities; and (3) identifying future directions of research in the areas of childhood diabetes/obesity, injury/violence, and substance use. The proposed conference will bring together up to 100 clinicians, epidemiologists, public health researchers, sociologists, psychologists, and other researchers in child health disparities. The conference will target child health disparities in the following areas: diabetes/ obesity, injury/violence, and substance abuse; in addition to policy and implementation issues. It will be an interactive conference involving panel speakers, discussants, and breakout sessions. It will be a one-and-a-half day conference held in the Washington, D.C. area. Proceedings of the conference will be published in a peer reviewed research journal. In addition, the proceedings will be made available on the Center's website and on CDs. Women and minorities will be well represented among both presenters and attendees of the conference.           ",Starting Early: Closing the Gap on Child Health Disparities,7225759,U13HD055095,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"International Meeting on Indigenous Child Health    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT):  Project Title: International Meeting on Indigenous Challenge: Indigenous populations in the US and Canada have long experienced health disparities compared to non-indigenous populations. While there have been gains in various health indicators over the past several decades, disparities still remain. Health care provision to indigenous populations is further complicated by difficulties related to access, which is caused by factors such as rural location and shortage of health care providers. In the US, the Indian health care system has been historically under-funded creating an additional challenge.      Purpose: The purpose of this international, collaborative conference will be to focus on innovative clinical care models and community-based public health approaches for children and youth in First Nations, Inuit, M¿tis, American Indian, and Alaska Native communities. The conference will be planned and jointly sponsored by a number of US and Canadian organizations and agencies including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP); the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS); the Indian Health Service (IHS); the First Nations Inuit Health Branch, Health Canada; the Association of American Indian Physicians (AAIP); the M¿tis National Council; and other tribal entities. This cross-border collaboration between the US and Canada complements other activities under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and Health Canada, signed at the Secretarial/Ministerial level in 2002. While the health care system in the US and Canada differs significantly, there are many similarities in terms of providing culturally effective care to indigenous children and youth. This conference will strive to bring exposure to successful models of care and unique research implemented at the community level, disseminate effective strategies, and provide opportunities for providers to gain valuable skills that can be utilized immediately.      Target Audience and Objectives: The target audience for this conference includes health care providers from the sponsoring organizations and from tribal and urban sites throughout the US and Canada. Anticipated attendance is 250 delegates. The conference theme is ""Solutions, Not Problems"", as the planning committee is committed to ensuring that conference delegates have the opportunity to gain practical knowledge and skills related to caring for indigenous children.      The learning objectives of the conference have been identified as follows: (1) Demonstrate increased awareness of the unique solutions and changing health needs of children in indigenous populations, (2) Examine knowledge and experiences of those working in child health about the provision of culturally effective care in indigenous communities, (3) Describe scholarly and community participatory research findings about the health and health care of indigenous populations, (4) Increase collaboration and exchange information among those working in child health and trainees who work with, or are interested in, the health of indigenous          ",International Meeting on Indigenous Child Health,7248376,R13HS016753,[''],AHRQ,AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS,R13,2007,49500,0.10843343524723008
"Critical Research Issues in Latino Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the last several years, a consortium of Hispanic Mental Health researchers led by the principal investigator has held annual national conferences on Hispanic Mental Health issues and research strategies as a vehicle for mentoring young investigators. These conferences have stimulated new research collaborations and led to numerous scientific publications and grant application submissions that were subsequently funded. The conference has been used as a model for other minority groups underrepresented among NIH researchers in their quest to stimulate needed growth in this area. Despite this significant progress, the task remains far from complete. There remains a serious shortage of Hispanic and other investigators working on Hispanic mental health research at a time of great need due to the massive expansion of the US Hispanic population. This proposal seeks support for a new series of yearly conferences on Mental Health issues relevant to Hispanic populations that will alternate theme and location. The major aim is to bring together promising new investigators with senior investigators in an effort to stimulate the networking and mentoring necessary to promote the entry of new investigators into Hispanic Mental Health research. The program will be guided by an organizing committee composed of Hispanic and non- Hispanic mentors and senior researchers. The American Society of Hispanic Psychiatrists as well as selected ""host institutions"" will play a role in co-sponsoring the conferences each year and will contribute to structuring the program and related activities. An average of twenty (18-22) promising new investigators will be competitively selected each year. These new investigators will be paired with outstanding senior investigators with the expectation that papers presented at the meeting will result in peer-reviewed publications. The conferences will also feature a ""keynote speaker"" to provide an integrative overview on the theme of the meeting. In addition, we will offer special sessions led by experts on specific research issues (research grant opportunities, grant writing skills, research methodology). Outcomes of the conference will be tracked and these will include number of peer reviewed publications, grants submitted/funded by the new investigators, quality aspects of mentor-mentee pairs and measures of networking and new collaborations. For 2007, the first year of the new award, we propose to hold the conference in November 2007 in South Florida at a location to be decided at a later time. The theme for the 2007 conference will be ""Primary Care-Mental Health Partnerships: A Focus on Hispanic Patients"". This proposal seeks support for a new series of yearly conferences on Mental Health issues relevant to Hispanic populations that will alternate theme and location. The major aim is to bring together promising new investigators with senior investigators in an effort to stimulate the networking and mentoring necessary to promote the entry of new investigators into Hispanic Mental Health research. The stimulation of new research careers is intended to improve the mental health disparities that are experienced among Hispanics in the US. The disparities have been partly attributed to the lack of available researchers focusing on mental health among ethnic minorities.          ",Critical Research Issues in Latino Mental Health,7331023,R13MH066308,"['Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Other Minority ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feedback ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Language ', ' Numbers ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Event ', ' Award ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-R W JOHNSON MED SCH,R13,2007,75751,0.053178834172761376
"Fighting Obesity in Central Mississippi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence and incidence of obesity continue to increase in the United States. The statistics are alarming in that obesity exceeds 25 percent in 13 states across the country. Although the majority of states show an increase in the rate of obesity, in 2005, the age adjusted obesity prevalence rate in Mississippi was 31.2 percent of its total population. Mississippi, once again in 2006, claimed the title of the most obese, ranking number 1 in the prevalence of obesity in the nation. There is growing concern about the association of obesity and chronic diseases because obesity is a gateway to increased risk for type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, and certain cancers. These health problems have contributed to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality and health disparities in Mississippi. Studies show that health disparities exist among populations experiencing these health problems, and, interestingly, the underserved populations tend to experience these at greater rates. Because of these statistics, this three-year study at the Jackson Medical Mall proposes to eliminate health disparities associated with obesity by health promotion and education in adult men and women of the Jackson Metropolitan community. The specific aims are to: 1) establish an annual health workshop series on obesity to provide a forum for information-sharing by a diverse group of scientists and community leaders at the forefront of research and service in this area.

"First International Inflammatory Breast Cancer Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, but aggressive, invasive and often deadly form of breast disease. IBC is often identified as a localized infection, i.e. mastitis, delaying proper treatment and resulting in rapid progression. In addition to diagnosis, the clinical and molecular understandings of IBC remain unclear. Its uncommon nature and vague management necessitate a forum in which experts and investigators in the field may present the most up to date information regarding IBC. The First International Conference on Inflammatory Breast Cancer seeks to educate and inform its participants, in order to bring about awareness and collective knowledge into clinical diagnosis, disease management, and molecular investigation. Our meeting will draw international faculty and participants from many countries. For example, seven of our speakers will represent five different countries, and we expect a high turn out from visiting scientists and physicians. We are targeting a diverse audience in order to educate faculty, physicians, mid-level providers, nurses, trainees and patient/advocates with up-to-date material ranging from clinical presentation and molecular mechanisms to health disparities and patient counseling. Our sessions are designed with this wide range of audience in mind and include breakout sessions for individual levels of development. With recent attention to IBC through the media and advocacy programs, our first of its kind symposium comes at a timely manner when interest is high.       Program Goals We are designing this conference to educate faculty, physicians, mid-level providers, nurses as well as trainees at all levels. Together with international thought-leaders of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) in both research and clinical management, attendees will have the opportunity to gather knowledge about successfully identifying and treating the rare nature of this disease. With our focus on training everyone from patient advocates to physicians, we plan to successfully raise awareness and promote the sharing of accurate information regarding IBC. The rare nature and unique presentation of IBC demands a re-education of health care professionals in order to ensure that misdiagnoses are eliminated and patient care is enhanced. In addition to communicating medical guidelines and practice regarding IBC, we will also focus on the latest research seeking to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that drive IBC initiation and progression, along with an update of clinical trials' data (i.e. Phase I reports of agent tolerability, EGFR overexpression, angiogenic factors, osteopenia) and epidemiological data, ex. demonstrating the increased prevalence in African American women communities. It is our goal that long standing relationships will be formed allowing for networking and consultation in the international cancer community promoting effective and efficient treatment and management. Each section of our symposium was designed with patient benefit in mind, including a patient/advocate breakout session that will enrich patient knowledge and offer support. Through education, management and therapy of those connected to and impacted by IBC, we hope to eliminate any delay in the assessment of IBC, thus allowing optimum patient care and management and stimulating the search for curative therapies.        Public Health Relevance: A Project Narrative was not included in the Program Announcement PA-06-041 and therefore assumed not required for this submission.

"Fighting Obesity in Central Mississippi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence and incidence of obesity continue to increase in the United States. The statistics are alarming in that obesity exceeds 25 percent in 13 states across the country. Although the majority of states show an increase in the rate of obesity, in 2005, the age adjusted obesity prevalence rate in Mississippi was 31.2 percent of its total population. Mississippi, once again in 2006, claimed the title of the most obese, ranking number 1 in the prevalence of obesity in the nation. There is growing concern about the association of obesity and chronic diseases because obesity is a gateway to increased risk for type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, and certain cancers. These health problems have contributed to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality and health disparities in Mississippi. Studies show that health disparities exist among populations experiencing these health problems, and, interestingly, the underserved populations tend to experience these at greater rates. Because of these statistics, this three-year study at the Jackson Medical Mall proposes to eliminate health disparities associated with obesity by health promotion and education in adult men and women of the Jackson Metropolitan community. The specific aims are to: 1) establish an annual health workshop series on obesity to provide a forum for information-sharing by a diverse group of scientists and community leaders at the forefront of research and service in this area. This series will build upon the recently held Jackson State University conference on ""Diabetes and Obesity (Diabesity);"" 2) establish an annual conference on diabetes and obesity (diabesity); 3) assess the use, efficacy, and change in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, including eating and physical activity, obtained following the utilization of diabetes and obesity - related materials ascertained from the NIH Resource Center at the Jackson Medical Mall in Jackson, Mississippi, established October 18, 2006; and 4) identify community health needs via focus groups. Pre- and post-test surveys administered to focus groups, and evaluations on the effectiveness of the workshops and resource materials will be used to a) determine the needs of the community; b) provide valuable feedback to the NIH Resource Center; and c) provide information for larger grant funding opportunities.

"Critical Research Issues in Latino Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the last several years, a consortium of Hispanic Mental Health researchers led by the principal investigator has held annual national conferences on Hispanic Mental Health issues and research strategies as a vehicle for mentoring young investigators. These conferences have stimulated new research collaborations and led to numerous scientific publications and grant application submissions that were subsequently funded. The conference has been used as a model for other minority groups underrepresented among NIH researchers in their quest to stimulate needed growth in this area. Despite this significant progress, the task remains far from complete. There remains a serious shortage of Hispanic and other investigators working on Hispanic mental health research at a time of great need due to the massive expansion of the US Hispanic population. This proposal seeks support for a new series of yearly conferences on Mental Health issues relevant to Hispanic populations that will alternate theme and location. The major aim is to bring together promising new investigators with senior investigators in an effort to stimulate the networking and mentoring necessary to promote the entry of new investigators into Hispanic Mental Health research. The program will be guided by an organizing committee composed of Hispanic and non- Hispanic mentors and senior researchers. The American Society of Hispanic Psychiatrists as well as selected ""host institutions"" will play a role in co-sponsoring the conferences each year and will contribute to structuring the program and related activities. An average of twenty (18-22) promising new investigators will be competitively selected each year. These new investigators will be paired with outstanding senior investigators with the expectation that papers presented at the meeting will result in peer-reviewed publications. The conferences will also feature a ""keynote speaker"" to provide an integrative overview on the theme of the meeting. In addition, we will offer special sessions led by experts on specific research issues (research grant opportunities, grant writing skills, research methodology). Outcomes of the conference will be tracked and these will include number of peer reviewed publications, grants submitted/funded by the new investigators, quality aspects of mentor-mentee pairs and measures of networking and new collaborations. For 2007, the first year of the new award, we propose to hold the conference in November 2007 in South Florida at a location to be decided at a later time. The theme for the 2007 conference will be ""Primary Care-Mental Health Partnerships: A Focus on Hispanic Patients"". This proposal seeks support for a new series of yearly conferences on Mental Health issues relevant to Hispanic populations that will alternate theme and location. The major aim is to bring together promising new investigators with senior investigators in an effort to stimulate the networking and mentoring necessary to promote the entry of new investigators into Hispanic Mental Health research. The stimulation of new research careers is intended to improve the mental health disparities that are experienced among Hispanics in the US. The disparities have been partly attributed to the lack of available researchers focusing on mental health among ethnic minorities.          ",Critical Research Issues in Latino Mental Health,7491003,R13MH066308,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Other Minority ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feedback ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Language ', ' Numbers ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Event ', ' Award ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-R W JOHNSON MED SCH,R13,2008,75431,0.053178834172761376
"HMO Research Network 13th Annual Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal requests National Cancer Institute (NCI) support for the 13th and 14th annual conferences of the HMO Research Network (HMORN) to be held March 19-21, 2007 in Portland, Oregon, and April 23-25, 2008 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Founded in 1994, the HMORN is a consortium of 15 nationally recognized research centers based in integrated health care delivery systems that focus on conducting non-proprietary clinical, epidemiologic, and health services research.  Integrated delivery systems provide the optimal mix of population base, electronic medical and financial databases, and longitudinal observation capabilities for health care research.  The mission of the Network is to use its collective capabilities to integrate research and practice for the improvement of health and health care among diverse populations.  The theme of the 2007 conference is 'Building a National Research Model: the Future of HMO-Based Research'. The tentative theme for the 2008 conference is 'Collaborative Research: Developing Efficient Processes and Partnerships'. The aims of the HMORN annual conference are to: 1) Provide a forum for HMORN researchers, representatives of funding agencies, and our academic partners to discuss methods and disseminate research findings from studies using the diverse patient populations and integrated delivery systems of the participating organizations, with a special focus on studies affiliated with the HMORN's Cancer Research Network (CRN); 2) Create opportunities for participants to develop collaborative research projects; 3) Enhance the ability of the HMORN research centers to respond to national goals to raise the effectiveness, efficacy, efficiency, and overall quality of health care delivery systems, and to contribute to national research agendas and funding priorities; 4) Enhance and share core competencies of our centers' research infrastructure; and, 5) Develop the research skills of young investigators and those new to the HMORN.  The HMORN annual conference is closely aligned with NCI's mission to support cancer research, research training, and to support cancer research networks. The HMORN received its first multi-institutional program award from the NCI in 1999. This initiative, the Cancer Research Network (CRN), now includes 13 of the HMORN members and was developed to study and improve the effectiveness of cancer control interventions in the HMORN's community-based health care systems.  Many of the research initiatives that have been advanced by the work of the HMORN are synergistic with the mission of the NCI.

"Cancer Disparities: Biennial Symposia & Education Forums This application seeks conference grant funding to the Chronic Disease Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine to support a series of scientific dissemination conferences sponsored with the Intercultural Cancer Council (ICC) over the years 2005-2009.  Specific Aims are to (1) convene the 10th and 11th Biennial Symposia; (2) convene semi-annual national Educational Forum meetings, scheduled between the Biennial Symposia; (3) utilize the ICC National Network to follow-up and reinforce accomplishments of the Biennial Symposia and Educational Forum meetings; and (4) utilize the ICC National Network to disseminate evidence based research results and funding opportunities related to cancer in minority and medically underserved populations.  Background and Significance.  There is a disproportionate incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality among minorities and persons of low-level income in the United States. To address this unequal burden of cancer, the Biennial Symposia and national Educational Forum meetings represent a tremendous resource and opportunity for professional development and networking as well as dissemination of evidence based research and best practices.  Furthermore, the communication channel is two-way, providing an opportunity for NCI and other federal agencies to hear from representatives of grass-roots organizations and local agencies.  The Biennial Symposium and Educational Forum meetings are thus excellent examples of the public-private, partnerships that will be necessary to properly address cancer disparities.  Methods. The Biennial Symposia on Minorities, the  Medically Underserved & Cancer and semiannual ICC Educational Forum meetings include formal presentations, panel discussions, question and answer sessions, posters, networking/caucusing opportunities, and sessions on national cancer policy.  These conferences are planned and designed to (1) exchange the latest scientific and treatment information and share strategies for reducing the disproportionate incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality among minorities and the medically underserved in the United States; (2) enhance the competency of health care providers, laypersons and survivors in the areas of primary and secondary cancer prevention, early detection and treatment; (3) promote culturally competent cancer care and services and ethnically balanced research; (4) address topics newly identified through evaluation data from the previous Biennial Symposia and ICC Educational Forum meetings as well as the ongoing ICC planning process; and (5) provide a forum for federal agencies such as NCI to share their strategies and responses to the unequal burden of cancer among minority and medically underserved populations.  Evaluation.  Traditional hard copy evaluation forms are completed onsite at the Symposium and Educational Forum meetings.  As of 2004, we are also using online electronic survey software which is providing response rates of > 50%.  In addition, the semi-annual Educational Forum meetings are purposefully scheduled in the interim between Biennial Symposia so that the activities and results of the preceding meeting can be assessed and utilized in the planning process for future meetings.

This conference series provides a translational opportunity to move the NRC's 18 recommendations into the next steps of research development. The 2008 conference will address minority research project recruitment and retention, a cross cutting issue for all NRC recommendations and a topic that the RCMARs have made important contributions to understanding and improving. In a recent analysis for the NIA, we found that faculty from the RCMAR program had produced 78 journal articles and provided 17 scientific presentations on these topics. The 2009 conference will address measurement and methods issues in minority aging research. From recruitment and methods, we move to the issue of intervention development in 2010. For the 2011 conference we will feature the issue of analytic techniques. The 2012 conference will focus on writing skills development and will address the links between macro (policy) systems and individual factors in minority aging research. Thus the five-year series mirrors the key ingredients in translational research: recruitment, methods, intervention development, analysis, and writing for publication and to inform policy. Each of the conferences will generate a number of significant outcomes and products, including: research development training for a minimum of 50 faculty/year; skill building products by each attendee; print and web- based resource materials; video streaming programs; one scientific publication submission per year based on the conference.

"3rd Annual Pediatric Telehealth Colloquium    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The 3rd Annual Pediatric Telehealth Colloquium is a two day conference proposed to be held in between September 15-17 in Tampa, Florida. We aim to create a forum, which brings together medical providers, hospital administrators and information technology specialists to share, disseminate, and train others to develop and improve clinical telemedicine programs. The purpose of these pediatric clinical telemedicine programs is to increase access to care, reduce disparities in care, and increase the overall quality of care delivered to children   in rural and underserved medical communities in a financially sustainable framework.      Conference Objective: The conference will provide information to both the providers of   telemedicine (hub sites) and users of telemedicine (remote sites), typically located in rural and underserved communities. The objectives of the two day conference are to: 1) provide an overview of the technical, administrative and clinical operations of a telemedicine program; 2) demonstrate how telemedicine can be used to assist in the care of pediatric patients in a variety of clinical settings; 3) disseminate information on the successful use of this technology to improve the access, quality and efficiency of care delivered to children; 4) provide theinformation required to ensure a self-sustaining, financially viable, successful telemedicine program; and 5) share current efforts on how to evaluate and research the impact of telemedicine on processes and outcomes of care.      Methods: We plan to achieve our objectives through interactive lectures, scientific sessions, as well as workshops on the five objectives. We will provide lectures, scientific sessions and workshops to help attendees better understand the technology of telemedicine and provide examples pediatric telemedicine care models in the outpatient and inpatient settings. Speakers will be selected from a range of experience and backgrounds, and will include clinicians, administrator and technicians from new and established programs, from hub and remote sites, and from academic and rural/underserved sites. We will also include scientific sessions that include platform presentations, targeted at novel and innovative uses of telemedicine, as well as poster presentations, targeted at clinical and programmatic issues in telemedicine.       In this proposal for small conference grant we requests partial funding for the conference to subsidize registration for rural practitioners and practitioners working in medically underserved communities, speaker fees for guest faculty to offset their out of pocket conference cost, and salary support and travel for the conference organizing committee.      Key Words Words: 1) Pediatrics; 2) Telehealth and Telemedicine; 3) Rural Health; 4) Research; 5)   Access to Health Care; 5) Primary Care Provider Education; 6) Healthcare Disparities; 7)      Relevance: The 3rd rd Annual Pediatric Telehealth Colloquium will provide an interactive   environment for sharing examples of successful telemedicine models, including technical, programmatic, administrative, and financial considerations.

"Equity and Efficiency in Health and Healthcare ? 2nd Biennial ASHE Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the second biennial American Society of Health Economists (ASHE) conference is to  provide a forum for emerging ideas and empirical results of health economics research. More specifically, the  goal is to facilitate a large community of health economists to gather to present and discuss high quality papers  representing new and innovative research in important areas of health economics. The outcomes include  better research, generation of new research ideas, development of junior researchers, dissemination of cutting-  edge ideas, and better policies.  One of the topical areas is aging. Plenary speakers, scientific sessions, and posters will cover topics such  as quality of care, Medicare (e.g. FFS vs. HMO and prescription drug plans), retirement and health, VA  services, disparities in health and treatments, old age assistance programs and health, long-term care,  preventive services for elderly, disparity, health insurance coverage, diffusion of technology, gender  differences, health production functions, and econometrics, among others, that would move forward NIA's  research agenda. We are now in the review phase of selecting papers, so the exact number of papers directly  related to aging is still being determined (last conference had 15). However, about 40 papers, that we deem to  be directly related to aging, have been submitted. Many of the health economists who will attend are NIA  grantees, and others may become interested in these topics after hearing the plenary speakers and the papers  presented.  One of our two invited plenary speakers, Mark McClellan, PhD, senior fellow at the AEI-Brookings Joint  Center, Director of the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform, and Leonard D. Schaeffer Director's Chair in  Health Policy Studies, will likely speak on health insurance, quality of care, and aging, drawing on his time at  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Dr. McClellan is known for his work on Medicare and  promoting high quality, innovative and affordable health care.  The second biennial ASHE conference will be held at Duke University in Durham, NC on June 22-25, 2008.  There will be pre-conference session held on Sunday, June 22. Regular scientific sessions will be held Monday  through Wednesday, June 23-25. We expect attendance of about 700.  ASHE is a relatively new organization, formed as an affiliate of iHEA. We had a very successful inaugural  meeting at the University of Wisconsin in 2005. Through the conference, ASHE provides a forum for the  exchange of ideas and information among health economics researchers, policy makers, and those who fund  health economics and health policy research. We hope that NIA will be interested in funding a small portion of  the total cost of this conference, particularly the aging-related components.

"Conference Plan - Institute for Health, Social and Community Research at Shaw Uni    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities continue to threaten the fabric and soul of our society. Significant investments are being made to investigate strategies for eliminating health disparities. One of several practices promoted as a strategy to eliminate health disparities is to increase the number of minority investigators engaged in research to address health disparities. This approach involves expanding research skills of promising investigators with a base of education and training, and creating a pipeline with mentorship, shadowing, and training of promising minority students.  Shaw University has embraced each of these strategies as a part of an expanding research agenda to train and equip faculty and students to join the ranks of researchers involved in the challenging research of eliminating health disparities. The first conference of The Institute for Health, Social and, Community Research (IHSCR) at Shaw University provided an opportunity for junior investigators and students to share results from research conducted and engaged other researchers in discussions about key issues in health disparities research. Additionally, this conference positioned Shaw University at the fore front of leadership in health disparity research. The IHSCR at Shaw University took the leadership role and organized its first research conference, September 8, 2006.  There was a diverse audience of attendees attracted to this conference including government officials, representatives from 15 institutions of higher education, public health advocates, community-based organizations, and researchers in the field of racial health disparities.      The purpose of the proposed conference is to increase awareness of racial health disparities; provide a forum for Shaw investigators and students to share research findings from critical research; showcase progress made in advancing and expanding the IHSCR agenda; and create a setting for researchers with similar interests to share information and form collaborations. A conference of this type will help in the recruitment of highly qualified faculty, students, and investigators to Shaw University.  This conference is targeted to reach investigators and students engaged in health disparities research from other institutions, government leaders from national, state and local agencies, representatives of community-based organizations, public health advocates, health care providers, and administrative officials. The goal for the second conference will be to reach 200 participants. The date for the proposed conference is September 26, 2008.           ","Conference Plan - Institute for Health, Social and Community Research at Shaw Uni",7487257,R13MD002743,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Institution ', ' Purpose ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Public Health Education ', ' Public Health Training ', ' Public Health Instruction ', ' Qualifying ', ' Faculty ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' Numbers ', ' Government Officials ', ' Mentorship ', ' Collaborations ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Universities ', ' Awareness ', ' interest ', ' Training and Education ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Shadowing (Histology) ', ' Shadowing ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Communities ', ' Minority ', ' ']",NIMHD,SHAW UNIVERSITY,R13,2008,50000,0.1869511467380957
"Women and Smoking:  Understanding Socioeconomic Influences    DESCRIPTION (reflected from application): Health disparities among disadvantaged women is a concern shared throughout the NIH, including NIDA and NCI. As was noted above, 170,000 deaths per year among women in the U.S. are attributable to smoking-related causes. The proportion of those women who are socioeconomically disadvantaged is growing (e.g., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2004). These women on average are least likely to respond to prevention and treatment interventions. Greater scientific understanding of the important social, behavioral, pharmacological, and biological controlling variables involved in this problem are needed if more effective interventions and policies are to be developed. Researchers from a number of different disciplines are studying the problem, but interdisciplinary efforts are lacking. This conference has the potential to enhance recognition of the urgency of the problem, embed the problem in a broader context with regard to other types of substance abuse as well as other non-substance-related public health problems, and perhaps most importantly foster interdisciplinary research efforts. For example, how the strong socioeconomic influences on smoking are to be reconciled with the strong heritability estimates coming out of genetics studies on smoking is unclear and investigators from the relevant disciplines need to be discussing those challenges (e.g., Graham et al., 2007; Uhl et al., 2007). As another example, sociological and epidemiological research documents an important potential moderating effect of education on the risk of smoking, but says little about how education would produce those effects (e.g., Graham et al., 2007). Research being conducted on executive function and risky choice among smokers by behavioral neuroscientists has the potential to advance understanding in that area (e.g., Johnson et al., 2007). There are many other examples where research on this general problem could be advanced through interdisciplinary efforts. To our knowledge, those interdisciplinary efforts are not occurring to any great extent currently. By inviting leaders from these different disciplines to participate in a single-track conference where they will listen to each other's presentations and have ample opportunity to ask each other questions has the potential to significantly improve upon that situation. By publishing the proceedings in a peer-reviewed journal that opportunity is enhanced even further because now interested professionals who did and did not attend the conference have the opportunity to examine each other's work in careful detail.          ",Women and Smoking:  Understanding Socioeconomic Influences,7485465,R13DA024956,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Behavioral ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Discipline ', ' Numbers ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Peer Review ', ' Genetic ', ' Smoker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Knowledge ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' interest ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Heritability ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R13,2008,48000,-0.02994717842452715
"New England Regional Minority Health Conference - From Disparities to Equity: The    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The New England Regional Minority Health Committee (NERMHC) is pleased to be hosting it's 6th Biannual Conference entitled Eliminating Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities by 2010: From Disparities to Equity - The Power to Make Change, which is scheduled to be held on March 30th, 31st and April 1st, 2009 at the Westin Hotel in Providence, Rhode Island. The NERMHC is an ever-evolving group of dedicated individuals, organizations, and agencies that have made a significant impact on minority health throughout New England and have set an example for the rest of the country. The Committee is best known for its biannual three-day New England Regional Minority Health Conference. Since 1999, the NERMHC plans and implements this event every two years targeting a very diverse audience, including staff from state and federal agencies, community-based organizations, non-profit and for-profit organizations, health insurers, academia, faith-based organizations, health care organizations, hospitals, community health centers, consumers and tribal nation partners. The conference is unique in two aspects. At each conference, each of the six New England states meet separately and report on its activities since the past conference and discuss planned activities for the following two years. State representatives hold each other accountable to their communities in this regional setting. The conference is about action and accountability as much as about education and celebration. Every attendee from a given state is an equal participant in this planning and accountability process. The other unique aspect of the conference is that the goals and activities of the conference are on-going through the work of the NERMHC. The conferences are the most visible outcome, but the year-round work between the conferences is what helps the actual event become a growing and powerful force for eliminating health disparities. As the biennial conference has grown in participation, (from 125 attendees in 1999 to 625 attendees in 2007), so has the need for financial support to sustain this effort. The NERMHC is a network of volunteers, professionals and consumers with a paid staff person (the Project Manager) and contract agency (the Fiscal Agent).            The mission of the New England Regional Minority Health Committee is to create a dynamic forum to develop strategies to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities.  The project's overall goals and specific objectives are to establish an on-going exchange of information, strengthen networks and partnerships, build capacity, provide mutual support to professionals, and improve access and quality of care to racial and ethnic community members throughout New England in an effort to reduce health disparities. Health disparities are the persistent gaps between the health status of minorities and non- minorities in the United States. 1",New England Regional Minority Health Conference - From Disparities to Equity: The,7614853,R13MD003344,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Academia ', ' Process ', ' Financial Support ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' minority health ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Individual ', ' Persons ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Rest ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Work ', ' day ', ' Event ', ' Country ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Accountability ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Schedule ', ' health organization ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' tribal Nation ', ' Outcome ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' volunteer ', ' ']",NIMHD,"WELCOMING LIGHT, INC.",R13,2008,50000,0.1685896570456143
"Conference on Behavior Change in the Era of HIV    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests funding for a scientific conference (Organizers Drs. Albarracin, del Rio, DiClemente, and Rothman) titled Theoretical Integration of HIV-Relevant Behavior Change Across Individuals, Family/Couple, and Community/Social Structures. The main goal of the conference is to generate an integrative theory (i.e., set of statements purported to provide a necessary and sufficient explanation of a complex phenomenon) of behavior change that takes into account various systems relevant to HIV prevention (i.e., the individual, the family/couple, the community/broader structural issues) and that addresses how the different levels influence individual behavior and clinical outcomes. This integration requires synthesizing research findings and inferring general principles that can inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of HIV prevention interventions. Relevant questions to be examined include: What are the limitations of current behavior change interventions? How could their impact be larger? What is the impact of family- and community-level interventions on the individual- level beliefs, emotions, and/or behaviors that can ultimately lead to change? What are the mediators and moderators of this impact? What are the reciprocal relations between changes in the individual and the broader systems? How can we explain these reciprocal relations? What techniques can produce change initiated at different levels? How can interventions at different levels be combined or designed to be complementary so that they effectively promote and sustain behavior change? What are the principles that guide such combinations? A first-rate cadre of 40 researchers from basic and applied areas (including women, ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities) will work towards this integration, make a presentation at the conference, work collaboratively with other scientists to produce a report, and publish a journal issue reporting their joint contribution. The organizers are active researchers in the social, medical, and behavioral sciences and have extensive conference-organizing and theory-building experience; they will lead the pre- and post-conference work, as well as the dissemination of the theoretical integration via journal articles, symposia at other conferences, a report, and a press release. The conference will be 3 days filled with presentations led by specially formed workgroups. Some teams will address the integration from particular starting points (e.g., Migration, poverty, gender, and race as structural conditions linked to belief and behavior change), whereas others will be in charge of synthesizing relations across the different intervening systems. The conference will advance the science of HIV prevention by providing the proposed theoretical integration, which is documented to likely influence the scientific literature as well as efficacious and innovative HIV behavior change intervention strategies. The conference is timely given an examination of the influence of prior theoretical integrations in the area of HIV and current advances in biological methods to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is also timely given the current NIMH agenda of understanding structural health inequalities, fostering researchers' interactions surrounding translational research, and advancing the study of health promotion from different levels of analysis. The conference location is Atlanta, GA, and offers advantages for the cost of the project, the recruitment of the audience of researchers, community members, and policy-makers. There is ample minority representation in the team of organizers and among the speakers. A conference with a team of leading researchers is proposed to help design an integrative theory that will maximize the development of effective and innovative interventions to change HIV-related behaviors. The contributions of the individual, the family, and the community will be analyzed to understand how to maximize the favorable impacts of interventions at all these levels. Various clinical outcomes are emphasized, which are relevant to prevention and treatment of many existing diseases.          ",Conference on Behavior Change in the Era of HIV,7422219,R13MH080619,"['Gender ', ' Charge ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' migration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Emotions ', ' Address ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fostering ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' journal article ', ' Press Releases ', ' Poverty ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Scientist ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' day ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R13,2008,111393,0.1225988440065325
"Strategies to Advance the National Research Council's Agenda on Minority Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract On behalf of the NIA Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMARs), with leadership by the RCMAR Coordinating Center (CC), we request funding for an annual series of five scientific research conferences. The content of the series will focus on ""Strategies to Advance the National Research Council's Agenda on Minority Aging"". Key themes and agenda topics will be selected for each conference from the research agenda developed by the National Research Council (NRC), ""Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health in Late Life"" (2004). This conference series provides a translational opportunity to move the NRC's 18 recommendations into the next steps of research development. The 2008 conference will address minority research project recruitment and retention, a cross cutting issue for all NRC recommendations and a topic that the RCMARs have made important contributions to understanding and improving. In a recent analysis for the NIA, we found that faculty from the RCMAR program had produced 78 journal articles and provided 17 scientific presentations on these topics. The 2009 conference will address measurement and methods issues in minority aging research. From recruitment and methods, we move to the issue of intervention development in 2010. For the 2011 conference we will feature the issue of analytic techniques. The 2012 conference will focus on writing skills development and will address the links between macro (policy) systems and individual factors in minority aging research. Thus the five-year series mirrors the key ingredients in translational research: recruitment, methods, intervention development, analysis, and writing for publication and to inform policy. Each of the conferences will generate a number of significant outcomes and products, including: research development training for a minimum of 50 faculty/year; skill building products by each attendee; print and web- based resource materials; video streaming programs; one scientific publication submission per year based on the conference.

"4th Annual Pediatric Telehealth Colloquium    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The 4th Annual Pediatric Telehealth Colloquium is a two day conference proposed to be held in between September 24-25 in Palm Springs, California. We aim to create a forum, which brings together medical providers, hospital administrators and information technology specialists to share, disseminate, and train others to develop and improve clinical telemedicine programs. The purpose of these pediatric clinical telemedicine programs is to increase access to care, reduce disparities in care, and increase the overall quality of care delivered to children in rural and underserved medical communities in a financially sustainable framework.   Conference Objective: The conference will provide information to both the providers of telemedicine (hub sites) and users of telemedicine (remote sites), typically located in rural and underserved communities. The objectives of the two day conference are to: 1) provide an overview of the technical, administrative and clinical operations of a telemedicine program; 2) demonstrate how telemedicine can be used to assist in the care of pediatric patients in a variety of clinical settings; 3) disseminate information on the successful use of this technology to improve the access, quality and efficiency of care delivered to children; 4) provide the information required to ensure a self-sustaining, financially viable, successful telemedicine program; and 5) share current efforts on how to evaluate and research the impact of telemedicine on processes and outcomes of care; 6) demonstrate the use of telemedicine in continuing medical education across multiple institutions.   Methods: We plan to achieve our objectives through interactive lectures, scientific sessions, as well as workshops on the five objectives. We will provide lectures; scientific sessions and workshops to help attendees better understand the technology of telemedicine and provide examples pediatric telemedicine care models in the outpatient and inpatient settings. Speakers will be selected from a range of experience and backgrounds, and will include clinicians, administrator and technicians from new and established programs, from hub and remote sites, and from academic and rural/underserved sites. We will also include scientific sessions that include platform presentations, targeted at novel and innovative uses of telemedicine, as well as poster presentations, targeted at clinical and programmatic issues in telemedicine. We will also create and provide the presentations and slides on DVDs and through websites at no additional cost for all interested providers across the United States.   In this proposal for small conference grant we requests partial funding for the conference to subsidize registration for rural practitioners and practitioners working in medically underserved communities by offsetting our other conference costs, speaker fees for guest faculty to offset their out of pocket conference cost, and salary support and travel for the conference organizing committee. Key Words: 1) Pediatrics; 2) Telehealth and Telemedicine; 3) Rural Health; 4) Research; 5) Access to Health Care; 5) Primary Care Provider Education; 6) Healthcare Disparities; 7) Quality of Care and Improvement.           Project Narrative Relevance: The 4th Annual Pediatric Telehealth Colloquium will provide an interactive environment for sharing examples of successful telemedicine models, including technical, programmatic, administrative, and financial considerations. The colloquium will also share how successful telemedicine programs have used this technology to provided health care services to underserved areas and accomplish this in a financially sustainable framework.

"Primary Care and Prevention Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) proposes the convening of the Annual Primary Care and Prevention Conference. This conference, attended by clinicians, researchers and other healthcare/ professionals for the last eight years, provides a continuing education opportunity for translating research into practice (best science to best-practice) for our national audience, as well as a bi-directional opportunity for front-line best practice to better inform researchers and policy-makers. We project that during the next three years, conference activities and inter-conference activities would reach more than 1,000 conference participants and another 10-15,000 individuals through conference dissemination activities. The purpose of the conference and its activities is threefold: 1) to synthesize, summarize, and communicate research findings to a broad range of organizations and individuals who can improve the health outcomes of their patients; 2) to develop national strategies for translating and disseminating research to public and private decision makers; and 3) to form collaborative partnerships that support local initiatives and healthcare providers in reaching out to under-served communities. The first year's proposed three-day meeting would take place from September 22nd through September 24th, 2010 in Atlanta, Georgia. The event will offer evidence-based primary care clinical updates, cutting edge theory in public health, and opportunities for practitioners to interact with a wide range of participants from community, academic, and other backgrounds. This combination of content and mission has become the hallmark of this primary care and prevention meeting and, according to evaluation reports, is the element that will make it different and useful to the 400 expected participants. The meeting agenda will offer sessions focused on health disparities related to gender, race and ethnicity, income and education, disability, rural health, and sexual orientation. Programming will also cover many of the 28 Healthy People 2010 focus areas including: access to quality health services; cancer; chronic kidney disease; diabetes; disability and secondary conditions; heart disease and stroke; HIV; immunizations and infectious disease; maternal, infant, and child health; mental health; nutrition and overweight; physical activity and fitness; public health infrastructure; substance abuse; tobacco use; and vision and hearing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEAVANCE: As with past conferences, Morehouse School of Medicine faculty members and our community-clinician partners propose to plan this ninth year conference as a ""bidirectional learning experience"" between academic experts and front-line clinician-experts for evidenced based primary care and public health strategies and interventions especially focused on improving health outcomes in and with high-disparity communities. To address the Healthy People 2010 (HP2010) goals and to meet needs cited by participants of past conferences, the programming committee will focus on health disparities related to gender, race and ethnicity, income and education, disability, and rural health. The event will offer evidence-based primary care clinical updates, cutting edge theory in public health, and opportunities for practitioners to interact with a wide range of participants from community, academic, and other backgrounds.           Narrative As with past conferences, Morehouse School of Medicine faculty members and our community-clinician partners propose to plan this ninth year conference as a ""bidirectional learning experience"" between academic experts and front-line clinician-experts for evidenced based primary care and public health strategies and interventions especially focused on improving health outcomes in and with high-disparity communities.

"Conference Series on Aging in the America: United States and Mexico    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed series of Conference workshops aims at increasing the visibility of research on aging Mexican- origin people and comes at a time when the topic is emerging as a crucial national budget and policy issue. The strength of the proposal is that the Conference Series and accompanying set of workshops bring together, for the first time, emerging research that demonstrates how social, psychological, and biological factors profoundly impact the health and long-term care of Mexican-origin people in late life. An important objective of the Conference Series is to identify disparities in Hispanic health, disability, and illness behavior. It is a relatively well-accepted tenet that health disparities are complex and multifaceted, and to understand them means grasping the intersection between biology and behavior. Thus, we hope to begin an interdisciplinary discussion of the unique situational factors and cultural behaviors that interact to impact the health and functioning of aging Mexican Americans. Research along these interdisciplinary lines will inform specific public health interventions related to disease prevention and identify improvements to public health systems that will protect the health of aging Hispanics. The ultimate objective of the Conference Series is to develop a consensus on the best means of insuring healthful aging of individuals of Mexican ancestry in the United States. Hispanics, especially those of Mexican ancestry, are re-shaping the demographic composition of the U.S. Hispanics are the fastest growing demographic group in the country, due to high immigration from Mexico and other Latin American countries, as well as higher fertility rates compared with non-Hispanic Whites and African-Americans (Tienda and Mitchell, 2006). In 2000, Hispanics became the nation's largest minority category. The Hispanic population has reached 36 million people, representing nearly 13 percent of the U.S. population. Mexican-origin Hispanics represent over half of that 36 million (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003). Moreover, the Hispanic population is aging, and as a result of their health issues and long-term medical needs, the health and wellbeing of this group is fast becoming a critical public policy concern (Angel and Hogan, 2004). A Conference Series focused specifically on increasing scholarly research into the aging process of the Mexican-origin population is vital. We believe this Conference Series will make a substantive contribution to the knowledge base, filling a significant vacuum of information on an understudied group of aging Americans. The consensus objective of the Series will inform the NIH Healthy People 2010 initiative to create national health objectives designed to identify the most significant preventable threats to health and to establish national goals to reduce these threats.           Hispanics, especially those of Mexican ancestry, are re-shaping the demographic composition of the U.S. Hispanics are the fastest growing demographic group in the country, due to high immigration from Mexico and other Latin American countries, as well as higher fertility rates compared with non-Hispanic Whites and African-Americans (Tienda and Mitchell, 2006).

"Critical Research Issues in Latino Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the last several years, a consortium of Hispanic Mental Health researchers led by the principal investigator has held annual national conferences on Hispanic Mental Health issues and research strategies as a vehicle for mentoring young investigators. These conferences have stimulated new research collaborations and led to numerous scientific publications and grant application submissions that were subsequently funded. The conference has been used as a model for other minority groups underrepresented among NIH researchers in their quest to stimulate needed growth in this area. Despite this significant progress, the task remains far from complete. There remains a serious shortage of Hispanic and other investigators working on Hispanic mental health research at a time of great need due to the massive expansion of the US Hispanic population. This proposal seeks support for a new series of yearly conferences on Mental Health issues relevant to Hispanic populations that will alternate theme and location. The major aim is to bring together promising new investigators with senior investigators in an effort to stimulate the networking and mentoring necessary to promote the entry of new investigators into Hispanic Mental Health research. The program will be guided by an organizing committee composed of Hispanic and non- Hispanic mentors and senior researchers. The American Society of Hispanic Psychiatrists as well as selected ""host institutions"" will play a role in co-sponsoring the conferences each year and will contribute to structuring the program and related activities. An average of twenty (18-22) promising new investigators will be competitively selected each year. These new investigators will be paired with outstanding senior investigators with the expectation that papers presented at the meeting will result in peer-reviewed publications. The conferences will also feature a ""keynote speaker"" to provide an integrative overview on the theme of the meeting. In addition, we will offer special sessions led by experts on specific research issues (research grant opportunities, grant writing skills, research methodology). Outcomes of the conference will be tracked and these will include number of peer reviewed publications, grants submitted/funded by the new investigators, quality aspects of mentor-mentee pairs and measures of networking and new collaborations. For 2007, the first year of the new award, we propose to hold the conference in November 2007 in South Florida at a location to be decided at a later time. The theme for the 2007 conference will be ""Primary Care-Mental Health Partnerships: A Focus on Hispanic Patients"". This proposal seeks support for a new series of yearly conferences on Mental Health issues relevant to Hispanic populations that will alternate theme and location. The major aim is to bring together promising new investigators with senior investigators in an effort to stimulate the networking and mentoring necessary to promote the entry of new investigators into Hispanic Mental Health research. The stimulation of new research careers is intended to improve the mental health disparities that are experienced among Hispanics in the US. The disparities have been partly attributed to the lack of available researchers focusing on mental health among ethnic minorities.          ",Critical Research Issues in Latino Mental Health,7682976,R13MH066308,"['Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Event ', ' Award ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' treatment adherence ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Feedback ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Language ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-R W JOHNSON MED SCH,R13,2009,77364,0.053178834172761376
"Setting a Quality Improvement Research Agenda to Leverage HIT/HIM in Rural Americ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Foundation of Research and Education in Health Information Management will convene a national conference to address issues related to quality-based incentive programs and healthcare information technology. Stakeholders such as Health Information Management (HIM) and Health Information Technology (HIT) professionals, health services researchers, and other healthcare-related government, policy and private sector industry stakeholders will be invited to this conference. Managing health information and HIT form the fundamental underpinnings for overall better patient/consumer care, in terms of potentially broadening access (e.g., disparities of care for minority/vulnerable populations particularly in rural areas), cost savings (e.g., administrative efficiencies), and enhancing quality and patient safety. Although many quality improvement approaches manifest themselves in the growing number of US pay- for-performance (P4P) or quality improvement programs (e.g., hospital and physician- based), these programs have few ties to encouraging HIT adoption, until recently. This conference will include presentations on related work funded by AHRQ addressing access to care of disparate populations in rural community health centers; pay-for-performance and the economic implications facing rural physician practices and hospitals; and healthcare workforce issues implicit in caring for rural (and urban) disenfranchised populations. It is anticipated that this conference will identify future work that will build on the existing research. The purpose of this conference is to profile current field practices and identify research gaps to develop a quality improvement health services research agenda for implementation of HIT/HIM. Key Conference Objectives  1) present and discuss the economic and strategic impact of HIT/HIM on quality  improvement  initiatives and alternative methods for incentivizing quality of care, e.g., pay-for-  performance, focusing on rural areas, healthcare disparities, and quality and patient  safety; 2) address current challenges and controversies, to include policy and practice in  quality improvement (e.g., pay-for-performance/quality programs) and the current  state of the research; 3) create a ""quality-improvement-based"" research agenda to address gaps in current  research, policy and practice; and 4) identify infrastructure needs to ensure research moves forward and to identify  strategic partners who will conduct collaborative research. The overarching conference aims will be twofold: 1) to explore ways of how to leverage the implementation of health information technology into rural and underserved areas; and 2) to explore alternative quality-based incenting methods to pay for health care. To that end, it is hoped that through the greater adoption and implementation of HIT/HIM in rural hospitals and small physician group offices, we will succeed in broadening access to and quality of care for vulnerable and disparate populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance to Public Health: Setting a quality improvement research agenda will promote the adoption and implementation of HIT (e.g., electronic health records) and management of health information for medically underserved areas in the U.S. The focus of research will be on improving access, quality, and patient safety in the small physician offices, hospitals in rural areas. A critical component will address the management of health information and its translation to consumer health education.           Relevance to Public Health: Setting a quality improvement research agenda will promote the adoption and implementation of HIT (e.g., electronic health records) and management of health information for medically underserved areas in the U.S. The focus of research will be on improving access, quality, and patient safety in the small physician offices, hospitals in rural areas.

"Institute for Health, Social, and Community Research at Shaw University Conferenc    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Conference Objectives   1. To increase knowledge and awareness of minority health disparities   2. To showcase minority health disparities research conducted at the IHSCR    3. To provide a forum to explore partnerships and collaborations between the IHSCR and Public health policy makers and practitioners for addressing health disparities    4. To introduce underrepresented students to research and orient them to the challenges and opportunities of careers in health disparities research.      The objective of the Minority Health Conference are consistent with the goals of the NIH Research Conference Grant Program and are relevant to the scientific mission of the NIH and to the public health.  These objectives are consistent with addressing the research priorities of the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities. These objectives are consistent with the Strategic Plan of Shaw University. This Strategic Plan outlines 15 institutional priorities toward which the University directs efforts and resources. Two of the fifteen strategies directly focus on expanding research activities. The President of Shaw University, Dr. Clarence G. Newsome, acknowledged the significance of this conference for building the stature of Shaw University as a leader in health disparities research (Letter of Support).      Conference Program   The conference is organized over a two day period to allow adequate time for meaningful exchange and discussion of research. This move follows significant feedback from participants at the two previous conferences to increase the length of the conference. Careful consideration was given to economic concerns with travel funds being cut by many agencies. The final decision was to extend the conference to two days and provide participant with a high quality conference offering sessions for the diverse audiences we are trying to attract. One of the overwhelming requests for change from the last conference evaluation was to increase the amount of time devoted to the student presentations and activities. In responding to this request, we will engage a number of current and former students as presenters. We are also engaging students in conference planning and communication to increase outreach to students to increase participation in the conference.       The focus of research in the IHSCR has been toward bio-medical and bio-behavioral issues. This approach has allowed researchers to carve out a specific niche that utilizes the unique skills of investigators in the IHSCR and issues of importance to policy makers, health care providers, and practitioners in North Carolina. The IHSCR investigators are interacting more with state health leaders so that there is exchange of information and exploration of how the IHSCR researchers can work with state public health leaders. Researchers will be mindful of the need to share results in a manner that will be useful to practitioners who are working on the front lines to reduce health disparities. This conference provides a unique opportunity for us to project the Institute as a leader in health disparities research and also project leadership organizing and sponsoring a high quality conference to disseminate the research findings. Careful attention to dissemination and translation of results will continue to e a part of the research process for investigators in the IHSCR.

"Native Healing and Wellness Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to the 2006 census report, there are approximately 93,000 American Indian/Alaska Natives (AIAN) in the state of Washington (1.5% of the total population). Due to complex relationships between Tribes and local, state, and federal agencies, healthcare may be provided by the Tribe, local service providers, the state, an Indian Health Service facility, a Native Health Board, or by some combination of the above. This results in having very little empirical data available regarding health disparities as they are experienced by AIAN communities, especially in regards to mental health and substance abuse. Equally important, little is known about community-based programs that often incorporate Tribal values, practices, and beliefs, and show promise of being effective for reducing health disparities and promoting good health. A lack of funding and overburdened resources can result in decreased access to appropriate training for behavioral health service providers working with Native communities. In response to these issues, we convened the first highly successful WA State Tribal Healing and Wellness Conference in May, 2008 which was attended by over 150 members of AIAN communities and those who serve them. We are proposing to hold a second Native Healing and Wellness Conference in August 2009 that would bring together representatives from the federally and state recognized tribes and other AIAN communities and agencies in Washington State. The conference will include 2 panels: one with members from AIAN communities with experience in collaborative research and the use of indigenous methods and knowledge; and the second with expertise in the areas of health disparities and behavioral health issues among AIAN's. Six workshop sessions will be offered to address issues identified during the first conference: 1) DBT as adapted for use with Native clients; 2) the use of traditional plants as food and medicine for treatment and prevention; 3) historical trauma; 4) treatment approaches for Native children; 5) how to conduct Community Based and Tribally Based Participatory Research; and 6) supervision in Native clinics. CE credits will be available for mental health and substance abuse providers. The primary objectives of the conference are to: 1) provide specific clinical skills for working with AIAN communities regarding mental health and substance abuse; 2) continue to build on our knowledge regarding substance abuse and mental health disparity issues of greatest concern to urban, rural, and reservation Native communities and practices that have been developed in Tribal communities to address such issues and show promise of being effective; and 3) provide an opportunity for Tribal organizations to connect and collaborate with researchers and research institutions, and to network with other Tribal communities. A conference report will document conference proceedings and continue to expand our knowledge base of effective approaches for reducing health disparities and promoting good health in AIAN communities.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The outcome of the proposed Native Healing and Wellness Conference is to reduce mental health disparities for Tribal communities and promote good health in culturally relevant approaches. This will be accomplished by the provision of culturally competent clinical skills training, by the identification and prioritization of health disparity, substance abuse, and mental health issues of greatest concern to AIAN communities in Washington State, and the identification of current promising practices developed in Tribal communities, with the goal of developing collaborative, community-based research and intervention strategies to address the identified concerns and strengthen current efforts.",Native Healing and Wellness Conference,7674068,R13MD002247,"['Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' Reservations ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Community Practice ', ' Food ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Area ', ' Healed ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Plants ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Supervision ', ' Tribes ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Belief ', ' Services ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' United States Indian Health Service ', ' Indian Health Service ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Skills ', ' Communities ', ' healing ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' tribal organization ', ' tribal board ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R13,2009,48750,0.020710098483371187
"Network for Justice Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The U.S. Justice system controls nearly 8 million young people and adults on any given day, and disproportionately touches the lives of minority and disadvantaged populations. The Network for Justice Health was established by Drs. Catherine A Gallagher and Faye S. Taxman at George Mason University to attend to the unmet public health needs of an underserved population. With the partnership of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Center for Outcomes and Evidence (COE), the Network for Justice Health will the goal of on-going open-access dissemination of conference-generated resources. The Network for Justice Health aims to create a global 'collaboratory' of researchers and policy makers addressing health and health care issues of justice-involved populations. The Network is built around these principles: 1) Mounting evidence suggests that individuals involved in the justice system have higher rates of unresolved physical and mental health disorders than their counterparts in the general population; 2) The evidence-base has not been adequately developed to describe the prevalence of the problem, the practices and treatments needed to address the problems, nor the policies to support improvements in health outcomes, nor has the potential of existing evidence been fully realized; 3) Initial studies demonstrate that the justice system does not provide adequate care to improve the overall functioning of this population; and, 4) Health care providers often do not have adequate evidence-based clinical guidelines for addressing and improving health and health-related outcomes (see, e.g., American Pediatric Association, 2001). This will move the field forward in establishing evidence-based guidelines for this medically complex and typically underserved population so that health and health-related outcomes may be improved. The anticipated conference related products may be divided into four components. The first product will be the generation of a research strategy across the relevant domains (defined below) and a timeline and grading scheme for assessing progress. The second set of products includes documentation and distribution of conference-related materials, including summaries of conference proceedings. Webinars will also be available to those unable to participate. Web-conferencing will also be available for post-meeting follow-up and ongoing committee meetings. A third set of products are aimed at the research and policy community, and include a series of invited articles in a special journal issue, a review article on evidence-based practice (EBP) for justice involved individuals by members of the Network for Justice Health such as co-directors Catherine Gallagher and Faye Taxman. The final will be an open-access, web-based resources for individuals around the country and globe. These will include a compilation of existing research and evidence on justice health topics, access to coded bibliographic information for rapid and free evidence searching, and automated mapping and graphing programming that will provide visual displays of knowledge areas and gaps across conditions, populations, and settings related to justice health. Support for three conferences is requested through AHRQ conference grants (February 23-26, 2010 in Phoenix AZ; February 22-25, 2011, Los Angeles; & February 21-24, 2012, Washington, D.C.)      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The 8 million people controlled by the U.S. Justice system on any given day have much higher rates of unresolved physical and mental health disorders than their counterparts in the general population.

"Fighting Obesity in Central Mississippi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence and incidence of obesity continue to increase in the United States. The statistics are alarming in that obesity exceeds 25 percent in 13 states across the country. Although the majority of states show an increase in the rate of obesity, in 2005, the age adjusted obesity prevalence rate in Mississippi was 31.2 percent of its total population. Mississippi, once again in 2006, claimed the title of the most obese, ranking number 1 in the prevalence of obesity in the nation. There is growing concern about the association of obesity and chronic diseases because obesity is a gateway to increased risk for type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, and certain cancers. These health problems have contributed to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality and health disparities in Mississippi. Studies show that health disparities exist among populations experiencing these health problems, and, interestingly, the underserved populations tend to experience these at greater rates. Because of these statistics, this three-year study at the Jackson Medical Mall proposes to eliminate health disparities associated with obesity by health promotion and education in adult men and women of the Jackson Metropolitan community. The specific aims are to: 1) establish an annual health workshop series on obesity to provide a forum for information-sharing by a diverse group of scientists and community leaders at the forefront of research and service in this area. This series will build upon the recently held Jackson State University conference on ""Diabetes and Obesity (Diabesity);"" 2) establish an annual conference on diabetes and obesity (diabesity); 3) assess the use, efficacy, and change in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, including eating and physical activity, obtained following the utilization of diabetes and obesity - related materials ascertained from the NIH Resource Center at the Jackson Medical Mall in Jackson, Mississippi, established October 18, 2006; and 4) identify community health needs via focus groups. Pre- and post-test surveys administered to focus groups, and evaluations on the effectiveness of the workshops and resource materials will be used to a) determine the needs of the community; b) provide valuable feedback to the NIH Resource Center; and c) provide information for larger grant funding opportunities. All information will be evaluated, translated, and disseminated throughout the Jackson Metropolitan Community.          ",Fighting Obesity in Central Mississippi,7791424,U13HD056502,"['Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Health Promotion and Education ', ' Health Promotion and Training ', ' Health Promotion and Instruction ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' hypertensive heart disease ', ' hypertensive heart disorder ', ' hypertensive cardiomyopathy ', ' heart hypertension ', ' heart disorder hypertension ', ' heart disease hypertension ', ' cardiac hypertension ', ' Community Health ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mississippi ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Scientist ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' fighting ', ' Woman ', ' Country ', ' Behavior ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ']",NICHD,JACKSON STATE UNIVERSITY,U13,2009,47105,0.03327522023639267

"Critical Research Issues in Latino Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the last several years, a consortium of Hispanic Mental Health researchers led by the principal investigator has held annual national conferences on Hispanic Mental Health issues and research strategies as a vehicle for mentoring young investigators. These conferences have stimulated new research collaborations and led to numerous scientific publications and grant application submissions that were subsequently funded. The conference has been used as a model for other minority groups underrepresented among NIH researchers in their quest to stimulate needed growth in this area. Despite this significant progress, the task remains far from complete. There remains a serious shortage of Hispanic and other investigators working on Hispanic mental health research at a time of great need due to the massive expansion of the US Hispanic population. This proposal seeks support for a new series of yearly conferences on Mental Health issues relevant to Hispanic populations that will alternate theme and location. The major aim is to bring together promising new investigators with senior investigators in an effort to stimulate the networking and mentoring necessary to promote the entry of new investigators into Hispanic Mental Health research. The program will be guided by an organizing committee composed of Hispanic and non- Hispanic mentors and senior researchers. The American Society of Hispanic Psychiatrists as well as selected ""host institutions"" will play a role in co-sponsoring the conferences each year and will contribute to structuring the program and related activities. An average of twenty (18-22) promising new investigators will be competitively selected each year. These new investigators will be paired with outstanding senior investigators with the expectation that papers presented at the meeting will result in peer-reviewed publications. The conferences will also feature a ""keynote speaker"" to provide an integrative overview on the theme of the meeting. In addition, we will offer special sessions led by experts on specific research issues (research grant opportunities, grant writing skills, research methodology). Outcomes of the conference will be tracked and these will include number of peer reviewed publications, grants submitted/funded by the new investigators, quality aspects of mentor-mentee pairs and measures of networking and new collaborations. For 2007, the first year of the new award, we propose to hold the conference in November 2007 in South Florida at a location to be decided at a later time. The theme for the 2007 conference will be ""Primary Care-Mental Health Partnerships: A Focus on Hispanic Patients"". This proposal seeks support for a new series of yearly conferences on Mental Health issues relevant to Hispanic populations that will alternate theme and location. The major aim is to bring together promising new investigators with senior investigators in an effort to stimulate the networking and mentoring necessary to promote the entry of new investigators into Hispanic Mental Health research. The stimulation of new research careers is intended to improve the mental health disparities that are experienced among Hispanics in the US. The disparities have been partly attributed to the lack of available researchers focusing on mental health among ethnic minorities.          ",Critical Research Issues in Latino Mental Health,7897756,R13MH066308,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Feedback ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Language ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Play ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Event ', ' Award ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' treatment adherence ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-R W JOHNSON MED SCH,R13,2010,78165,0.053178834172761376
"Human Rights and Public Health: Eliminating Minority Health Disparities in the SF    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Eliminating Minority Health Disparities in the SF Bay Area, California Abstract: This grant application requests two-year support for Annual SFSU Human Rights Summits sponsored and coordinated by the Global Peace, Human Rights and Justice Studies Program, the Institute for Civic and Community Engagement, the Health Equity Institute, and the Center for Health Disparities Research and Training at San Francisco State University. SFSU is a minority-serving institution (MSI) committed to promoting equity and social justice for both campus and external constituencies through the diversity of its students and employees. The 7th Annual SFSU Human Rights Summit will be held on May 15-17, 2010, at the Cesar Chavez Student Center at SFSU, CA, a handicapped accessible facility. The conference theme is Health and Education Equity. The overall goal of each of the Summits is to provide a forum for discussion about the various challenges, solutions, and opportunities to prevent and eliminate health disparities in poor underserved neighborhoods and in ethnic minorities from a human rights perspective. When basic human rights are protected, health equity naturally ensues. The San Francisco Bay Area in California, inhabited by 7.4 million people, is a minority-majority area, as non-Hispanic whites comprise less than half of its population. Ethnic minority groups in the SF Bay Area, following a national trend, suffer disproportionately from a number of preventable diseases and health problems, including mental illness, diabetes, asthma, and cancer. Participants will discuss best practices in social and behavioral research, encourage and solidify local networking connections, and examine community-based participatory research methods for collaboration among researchers, health professionals, community leaders, and human rights advocates. The annual SFSU human rights summits have consistently drawn a large, diverse, and dynamic group of participants--last year's 6th annual summit on Health Equity was attended by more than 2000 people including graduate and undergraduate students, and faculty at SFSU, UCSF, UCB, USF, Stanford, and local community colleges, as well as advocates, health professionals, policymakers, researchers, and community leaders from all over the country. The social and cultural aspects of inequality have emerged throughout the initial six summits as key determinants of ill health. The prevention and elimination of structural, interpersonal, and symbolic barriers to health equity are thus necessary for the achievement of optimal health in all communities, including those that are socially disadvantaged. Recourse to the performing arts, including theater, dance, and spoken word is a unique feature of the summits, creating a forum for the cross-fertilization of interdisciplinary ideas that fill the gap in minority disparities research. We build each year upon the prior year's conference. All of the tools we develop-books, videos, brochures, websites, theater performances--are open source and publically available, including all materials from the summit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As human rights education becomes more integrated into public health, it is vital that all stakeholders have a forum to convene and share ideas in an open space. The proposed range of annual workshops and panels, will provide this vital link, and is likely to lead to improved health outcomes as a result of the trans-disciplinary community-based research collaborations and/or outreach activities that are fomented by the summit.

"Population Center Faculty Meetings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people experience systemic health disparities. A remaining obstacle to growth of our understanding of LGBT health and ability to take steps to address LGBT health disparities is the lack of opportunities for interdisciplinary scientists to meet and exchange ideas about the key issues and methodological challenges in understanding sexual and gender minorities (SGM). The proposed annual Scientific Meeting in LGBT Population Health Research sponsored by The Center for Population Research in LGBT Health (the Center) at The Fenway Institute of Fenway Health will fill this gap. To be held annually in the summer at Fenway Health's Conference Center in Boston, Massachusetts, the Scientific Meeting will draw together a diverse national group of experts and promising new scientists to advance the state of the science in the study of SGM population health. Each meeting will share the core objectives to 1) exchange information about the most recent developments in SGM population health; 2) coordinate cooperative research endeavors in SGM health through Working Groups sponsored by the Center; and 3) explore and seek solutions to methodological challenges in studying and estimating SGM population groups. In response to ongoing advances in the field, an Organizing Committee will annually select focused and timely topics to be addressed at each meeting by the invited speakers and key meeting participants. Areas of focus for the 2010 meeting include the health of SGM racial minority groups, chronic conditions and disabilities in older sexual and gender minorities, and child development in families parented by lesbians and gay men. The format of the proposed 2010 meeting includes scientific presentations by invited speakers, presentations of work in progress from faculty leaders of the Center, discussions of methodological problems and solutions, and working group breakout sessions. Meeting participants will include the faculty of the Center, graduate student mentees enrolled in the Center's Mentoring and Training Program, community research partners and other research collaborators. Keynote scientific presentations will be open to the public and advertised to the LGBT community. The format for subsequent meetings is expected to be similar to the proposed 2010 meeting, but will be adjusted by the Organizing Committee in response to evaluation feedback from the previous year.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Scientific Meeting will contribute to an understanding of the behavioral and social science aspects of human development.

"The Art and Science of Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR): Methods, Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last decade, Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) has emerged as an approach for addressing public health problems. Most importantly, academic and community-based entities have begun to form collaborative efforts based on CBPR principles to reduce racial/ethnic health disparities and improve minority health. These partnerships are fueled by the notion that many contemporary health problems involve complexities which will not be adequately addressed by traditional research approaches. At this time, there is a need to build upon the investment into CBPR to maximize the return for minority health and health disparity research by providing a conference forum that will promote use of CBPR approaches nationally among a diverse cadre of health behavior researchers. Designed by the American Academy of Health Behavior (AAHB), the proposed conference seeks to bring together leading CBPR experts (both behavioral scientists and community partners) who represent some of the most innovative research programs in the field of CBPR, minority health, and health disparities. The conference will provide a forum for academic and community experts to interact with conference participants about the strategies that predict successful outcomes in CBPR and the added value of CBPR for health behavior research. Conference attendees will include traditional researchers who have considerable expertise in one or more of a variety of priority content areas of relevance to racial/ethnic minority communities, but for whom CBPR is an approach which they are not well acquainted at this time. AAHB expects to expand how traditional health behavior researchers think about their work and increase the likelihood that they will adopt CBPR principles to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. AAHB has three objectives for this conference: (1) challenge senior investigators to expand their research to focus on high-priority minority health problems and the use of CBPR to address them; (2) mentor young, minority investigators in the production of high-quality scholarly products that address minority health concerns and health disparities using CBPR; and (3) build collaborative networks of academic and community-based experts to foster future CBPR partnerships to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. One key feature of the proposed conference is that community partners from existing CBPR projects will be included in the conference program to facilitate learning among researchers and partners alike. A second key feature is that AAHB and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation's Community Health Scholars Program will partner to establish a mentorship program for early career researchers from racial and ethnic minority groups. Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) has promise for improving public health. Yet, there is a great deal to learn about the application of this approach for helping communities. In addition, much remains to be learned about how traditional health behavior researchers understand participatory research, such as: (1) its potential for positively impact minority health and reduce/eliminate health disparities and (2) methods needed to be successful in developing and maintaining participatory relationships with non-academic community partners. Thus, the American Academy of Health Behavior (AAHB) proposes to hold a scientific meeting that will stimulate face-to-face intellectual discussion between (1) senior CBPR principal investigators, (2) community partners, and (3) traditional health behavior researchers on the application of CBPR to specifically address problems in minority health and health disparities. A conference of this type has not been held in recent years. In addition, we are not aware of meetings which have supported a mentoring program designed to build research capacity by fostering the development of early career researchers from racial and ethnic minority groups (traditionally underrepresented in science). AAHB expects that providing this conference will produce long lasting effects that will strengthen future CPBR efforts.           Project Narrative  Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) has promise for improving public health.

"Seventh National Conference on Quality Health Care for Culturally Diverse Populat    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant The Seventh National Conference on Quality Health Care for Culturally Diverse Populations, with its thematic focus on improving health care for culturally diverse populations: a new place on the national health agenda, will convene October 18-21, 2010 in Baltimore, Maryland. Over the past six conferences, 3,400 attendees from the US and abroad have participated in more than 300 conference sessions delivered by over 1,075 speakers. The objective of the 2010 conference is to bring together leading voices engaged in the major changes occurring in policy, standards, and accreditation with health care professionals at the local, state and national levels committed to improving cultural competence, reducing language barriers, and eliminating disparities. The seventh in this biennial conference series will continue to engage providers, communities, and policymakers to confront the challenges of addressing the health care needs of diverse populations by highlighting major policy initiatives and their implications for improving care for diverse patients and communities, while continuing to feature sessions on tested and emerging strategies that will appeal to ""seasoned"" veterans and others interested in the practical application of findings and initiatives. Conference themes include : the implications of health care reform for diverse populations; how to implement new standards on culturally and linguistically appropriate services from The Joint Commission and the National Committee for Quality Assurance; how health care organizations can respond to health IT and demographic data collection recommendations from the Institute of Medicine and federal health agencies; and integrating consumer, patient, family, and community perspectives into these initiatives, and the demand for increased accountability, effectiveness, and transparency. As in previous years, we anticipate 650 attendees who will participate in over 50 conference sessions featuring ""cutting edge"" programs, policies, initiatives, and research, through innovative and varied formats for presentation and discussion, while allowing participants numerous opportunities to reconnect with colleagues and network with other national and international professionals over the three- and-a-half-day event.

"Potential of ICU telemedicine to improve patient safety, reduce morbidity & morta    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical illness represents an enormous clinical and financial burden on the United States Health care system. Over 4 million patients are admitted to an intensive care unit each year, and ICU related costs exceed $50 billion annually. ICU telemedicine is a health care innovation that combines clinical expertise with electronic monitoring systems to improve the quality and safety of intensive care. Little evidence exists to guide adoption of telemedicine in the United States, yet these programs are expanding at a rapid rate, with substantial financial cost to the health system. In order to better inform health policy, a diverse program of research is needed to determine the organizational and system-level factors that modify the effectiveness of telemedicine programs, as well as the role of ICU telemedicine in patient safety, evidence-based practice, patient satisfaction and medical education. We propose a comprehensive interdisciplinary conference to develop and disseminate a research agenda for ICU telemedicine. The conference will bring together a diverse group of experts in critical care, health services research, health economics, information technology, patient safety and organizational science. The goals of the conference will be to: (a) critically examine the state of the science underlying ICU telemedicine, (b) reach consensus on a common lexicon for critical care delivery through telemedicine, (c) identify important knowledge gaps in ICU telemedicine within the context of current ICU services in the US and (d) assess the scientific and methodological approaches necessary to fill these knowledge gaps. The conference will be organized and managed by critical care health services researchers with extensive experience in interdisciplinary workshop planning, with the support of the Quad Critical Care Professional Societies, an established collaboration of the four major critical care specialty societies. We will utilize a standardized iterative consensus process to determine important knowledge gaps in ICU telemedicine and develop a comprehensive research agenda. Conference proceedings will be published in a peer reviewed journal and disseminated through the internet and targeted direct mailings to key stakeholders. Overall, the results of this conference will provide essential foundation for future research in ICU telemedicine with the goal of improving the quality and safety of health care for patients with critical illness.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance of this topic to AHRQ priority populations   The AHRQ mission is ""to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of care for all Americans."" This conference directly addresses an innovative approach to improve the quality and safety of critical care, especially to rural and minority populations. Rural health is an important policy problem in the US and a key population of interest to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.  Studies consistently show that rural populations have decreased access to high quality health care, both in primary care and in the hospital setting. Approximately 34% of US hospitals with ICUs are located in rural areas. A recent report on the critical care workforce by the Health Resources and Service Administration specifically cited the lack of trained critical care clinicians in rural hospitals as a major public health problem. Rural urban disparities disproportionately affect the elderly, military veterans, Latino, and indigenous populations, other populations of interest to AHRQ. Research addressing these disparities is a vital component of efforts to improve overall health care quality. Telemedicine is also a patient safety innovation with potential effects that transcend regional health disparities. Applied effectively, telemedicine could reduce preventable harm in all American ICUs, significantly impacting ICU quality as a whole.           Relevance)of)this)topic)to)AHRQ)priority)populations) The)AHRQ)mission)is)""to)improve)the)quality,)safety,)efficiency,)and)effectiveness)of)care)for)all) Americans."")This)conference)directly)addresses)an)innovative)approach)to)improve)the)quality) and)safety)of)critical)care,)especially)to)rural)and)minority)populations.)Rural)health)is)an) important)policy)problem)in)the)US)and)a)key)population)of)interest)to)the)Agency)for) 21 Healthcare)Research)and)Quality. )Studies)consistently)show)that)rural)populations)have) decreased)access)to)high)quality)health)care,)both)in)primary)care)and)in)the)hospital)setting.22) Approximately)34%)of)US)hospitals)with)ICUs)are)located)in)rural)areas.23)A)recent)report)on)the) critical)care)workforce)by)the)Health)Resources)and)Service)Administration)specifically)cited)the) 24 lack)of)trained)critical)care)clinicians)in)rural)hospitals)as)a)major)public)health)problem. )Rural- urban)disparities)disproportionately)affect)the)elderly,)military)veterans,)Latino,)and)indigenous) 25-28 populations,)other)populations)of)interest)to)AHRQ. )Research)addressing)these)disparities)is) a)vital)component)of)efforts)to)improve)overall)health)care)quality.29,)30)Telemedicine)is)also)a) patient)safety)innovation)with)potential)effects)that)transcend)regional)health)disparities.)

"Quality of Public Health Nursing Care: Prioritizing the Research Agenda    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The specific conference objectives are to:  (1) examine the quality and safety parameters of PHN interventions, and identify gaps in the evidence linking PHN interventions to population health outcomes;  (2) prioritize research needed to establish quality and safety standards for PHN interventions and address the identified gaps linking PHN interventions to population health outcomes;  (3) specify the methodological and data barriers to understanding the relationships among quality of care, safety, cost and type of PHN interventions, and population health outcomes;  (4) recommend strategies to overcome identified barriers to research linking PHN intervention type, quality, safety and cost with population health outcomes; and  (5) disseminate the prioritized research agenda to nursing researchers and public health systems scholars and potential funders, including federal agencies and foundations, with the objective of health improvement and reduction of health disparities.  The conference design includes invited, state-of-the art papers reviewing existing research and methods; facilitated small discussion groups exploring gaps in existing research, barriers and issues; and an all-participant consensus-building process establishing the research agenda priorities. One of eight domains will be addressed by an invited speaker and discussants: quality of PHN interventions, safety of PHN interventions, outcomes/effectiveness and costs of PHN interventions for population-patients, research methods challenges related to studying quality, safety, outcomes and costs of PHN interventions. The conference will be held over two eight-hour days in late September or early October 2010, at the Hilton Chicago/Indian Lakes Resort and Conference Center, located 30 miles from the O'Hare airport, for an anticipated 100 invited participants. The Conference Planning Committee will be actively engaged in fine- tuning the list of state-of-the art topics, finalizing the list of invited speakers, and selecting poster presentations. Products directly resulting from the conference include eight white papers that reflect the eight domains, published papers, and adoption of the research agenda by funders. Proposed date for the conference: Late Sept or Early October 2010, pending availability.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health nurses provide the majority of personal, preventive public health services, making them a vital element of the health care delivery system. Research based on the agenda generated at this conference will identify how public health nursing (PHN) interventions contribute to population health outcomes and how those population outcomes may be affected by the safety and quality of PHN interventions. Potentially the net result of the research stimulated by this conference is more effective and efficient interventions to improve the health of the public.           Project Narrative: Public health nurses provide the majority of personal, preventive public health services, making them a vital element of the health care delivery system.

"Primary Care and Prevention Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) proposes the convening of the Annual Primary Care and Prevention Conference. This conference, attended by clinicians, researchers and other healthcare/ professionals for the last eight years, provides a continuing education opportunity for translating research into practice (best science to best-practice) for our national audience, as well as a bi-directional opportunity for front-line best practice to better inform researchers and policy-makers. We project that during the next three years, conference activities and inter-conference activities would reach more than 1,000 conference participants and another 10-15,000 individuals through conference dissemination activities. The purpose of the conference and its activities is threefold: 1) to synthesize, summarize, and communicate research findings to a broad range of organizations and individuals who can improve the health outcomes of their patients; 2) to develop national strategies for translating and disseminating research to public and private decision makers; and 3) to form collaborative partnerships that support local initiatives and healthcare providers in reaching out to under-served communities. The first year's proposed three-day meeting would take place from September 22nd through September 24th, 2010 in Atlanta, Georgia. The event will offer evidence-based primary care clinical updates, cutting edge theory in public health, and opportunities for practitioners to interact with a wide range of participants from community, academic, and other backgrounds. This combination of content and mission has become the hallmark of this primary care and prevention meeting and, according to evaluation reports, is the element that will make it different and useful to the 400 expected participants. The meeting agenda will offer sessions focused on health disparities related to gender, race and ethnicity, income and education, disability, rural health, and sexual orientation. Programming will also cover many of the 28 Healthy People 2010 focus areas including: access to quality health services; cancer; chronic kidney disease; diabetes; disability and secondary conditions; heart disease and stroke; HIV; immunizations and infectious disease; maternal, infant, and child health; mental health; nutrition and overweight; physical activity and fitness; public health infrastructure; substance abuse; tobacco use; and vision and hearing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEAVANCE: As with past conferences, Morehouse School of Medicine faculty members and our community-clinician partners propose to plan this ninth year conference as a ""bidirectional learning experience"" between academic experts and front-line clinician-experts for evidenced based primary care and public health strategies and interventions especially focused on improving health outcomes in and with high-disparity communities. To address the Healthy People 2010 (HP2010) goals and to meet needs cited by participants of past conferences, the programming committee will focus on health disparities related to gender, race and ethnicity, income and education, disability, and rural health.

"Network for Justice Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The U.S. Justice system controls nearly 8 million young people and adults on any given day, and disproportionately touches the lives of minority and disadvantaged populations. The Network for Justice Health was established by Drs. Catherine A Gallagher and Faye S. Taxman at George Mason University to attend to the unmet public health needs of an underserved population. With the partnership of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Center for Outcomes and Evidence (COE), the Network for Justice Health will the goal of on-going open-access dissemination of conference-generated resources. The Network for Justice Health aims to create a global 'collaboratory' of researchers and policy makers addressing health and health care issues of justice-involved populations. The Network is built around these principles: 1) Mounting evidence suggests that individuals involved in the justice system have higher rates of unresolved physical and mental health disorders than their counterparts in the general population; 2) The evidence-base has not been adequately developed to describe the prevalence of the problem, the practices and treatments needed to address the problems, nor the policies to support improvements in health outcomes, nor has the potential of existing evidence been fully realized; 3) Initial studies demonstrate that the justice system does not provide adequate care to improve the overall functioning of this population; and, 4) Health care providers often do not have adequate evidence-based clinical guidelines for addressing and improving health and health-related outcomes (see, e.g., American Pediatric Association, 2001). This will move the field forward in establishing evidence-based guidelines for this medically complex and typically underserved population so that health and health-related outcomes may be improved. The anticipated conference related products may be divided into four components. The first product will be the generation of a research strategy across the relevant domains (defined below) and a timeline and grading scheme for assessing progress. The second set of products includes documentation and distribution of conference-related materials, including summaries of conference proceedings. Webinars will also be available to those unable to participate. Web-conferencing will also be available for post-meeting follow-up and ongoing committee meetings. A third set of products are aimed at the research and policy community, and include a series of invited articles in a special journal issue, a review article on evidence-based practice (EBP) for justice involved individuals by members of the Network for Justice Health such as co-directors Catherine Gallagher and Faye Taxman. The final will be an open-access, web-based resources for individuals around the country and globe. These will include a compilation of existing research and evidence on justice health topics, access to coded bibliographic information for rapid and free evidence searching, and automated mapping and graphing programming that will provide visual displays of knowledge areas and gaps across conditions, populations, and settings related to justice health. Support for three conferences is requested through AHRQ conference grants (February 23-26, 2010 in Phoenix AZ; February 22-25, 2011, Los Angeles; & February 21-24, 2012, Washington, D.C.)      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The 8 million people controlled by the U.S. Justice system on any given day have much higher rates of unresolved physical and mental health disorders than their counterparts in the general population.

"Educational Activities of Environment Section at APHA Annual Meeting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary. The138th Annual Meeting and Exposition of the American Public Health Association (APHA) will be held from November 6 - 10 in Denver, Colorado. The theme for this year's conference, with an anticipated 12,000 in attendance, is Social Justice: A Public Health Imperative. While the APHA is a large organization, it relies on its 27 sections to plan most of its conference sessions and special events. The Environment Section of the APHA, in its 99th year, is focusing its annual meeting agenda on environmental public health and social justice issues, particularly how social injustice can lead to negative environmental conditions and outcomes for disadvantaged, vulnerable, and underserved populations. Its call for full session proposals and abstracts focused on the overall theme of social justice, and on the Section's emphasis on social justice issues as related to environmental public health. Ultimately the Section strives to offer a wide variety of sessions, posters, plenary sessions, and special events to a diverse audience, representing academicians, health professionals, community members, and students, especially those from underrepresented groups. The Environment Section has the following aims for its educational activities at the 138th APHA Annual Meeting: 1)to educate conference participants about research on environmental public health issues related to social justice; 2)to increase collaborations between community groups, health professionals, and academicians through its program activities, especially sessions in which scientists and community members can share ideas and discuss common goals; 3)to educate students, especially those from underserved and minority communities, about social justice, environmental justice, and environmental health, encouraging them to pursue careers in public health research and practice and 4) to provide a forum for dissemination of results about research in social justice, environmental justice, and environmental health. The Environment Section's agenda for the Annual Meeting will benefit participants greatly, from community members who will have the opportunity to network with other community groups and with environmental health scientists, to students who will have the ability to connect with potential mentors, and to researchers who will learn about community- based environmental justice initiatives.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The program for the Environment Section at the 2010 American Public Health Association Annual Meeting will greatly benefit participants, particularly community members and students from underserved populations, who will have the opportunity to learn about community-driven efforts to address environmental justice and health issues; community-university partnerships for environmental health; how to build community capacity to address environmental health and justice issues; and best practices associated with effective community based participatory research efforts.              Project Narrative The program for the Environment Section at the 2010 American Public Health Association Annual Meeting will greatly benefit participants, particularly community members and students from underserved populations, who will have the opportunity to learn about community-driven efforts to address environmental justice and health issues; community-university partnerships for environmental health; how to build community capacity to address environmental health and justice issues; and best practices associated with effective community based participatory research efforts.",Educational Activities of Environment Section at APHA Annual Meeting,8062819,R13ES019799,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Address ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Social Impacts ', ' Food ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Ensure ', ' Justice ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' American Public Health Association ', ' APHA ', ' Mentors ', ' Collaborations ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Poisons ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Social Justice ', ' posters ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Scientist ', ' Universities ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social ', ' air cleaner ', ' Special Event ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' abstracting ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' global environment ', ' global environmental ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' Outcome ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' environmental justice ', ' public health research ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R13,2010,11000,0.06336990508793401
"Conference Series on Aging in the America: United States and Mexico    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed series of Conference workshops aims at increasing the visibility of research on aging Mexican- origin people and comes at a time when the topic is emerging as a crucial national budget and policy issue. The strength of the proposal is that the Conference Series and accompanying set of workshops bring together, for the first time, emerging research that demonstrates how social, psychological, and biological factors profoundly impact the health and long-term care of Mexican-origin people in late life. An important objective of the Conference Series is to identify disparities in Hispanic health, disability, and illness behavior. It is a relatively well-accepted tenet that health disparities are complex and multifaceted, and to understand them means grasping the intersection between biology and behavior. Thus, we hope to begin an interdisciplinary discussion of the unique situational factors and cultural behaviors that interact to impact the health and functioning of aging Mexican Americans. Research along these interdisciplinary lines will inform specific public health interventions related to disease prevention and identify improvements to public health systems that will protect the health of aging Hispanics. The ultimate objective of the Conference Series is to develop a consensus on the best means of insuring healthful aging of individuals of Mexican ancestry in the United States. Hispanics, especially those of Mexican ancestry, are re-shaping the demographic composition of the U.S. Hispanics are the fastest growing demographic group in the country, due to high immigration from Mexico and other Latin American countries, as well as higher fertility rates compared with non-Hispanic Whites and African-Americans (Tienda and Mitchell, 2006). In 2000, Hispanics became the nation's largest minority category. The Hispanic population has reached 36 million people, representing nearly 13 percent of the U.S. population. Mexican-origin Hispanics represent over half of that 36 million (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003). Moreover, the Hispanic population is aging, and as a result of their health issues and long-term medical needs, the health and wellbeing of this group is fast becoming a critical public policy concern (Angel and Hogan, 2004). A Conference Series focused specifically on increasing scholarly research into the aging process of the Mexican-origin population is vital. We believe this Conference Series will make a substantive contribution to the knowledge base, filling a significant vacuum of information on an understudied group of aging Americans. The consensus objective of the Series will inform the NIH Healthy People 2010 initiative to create national health objectives designed to identify the most significant preventable threats to health and to establish national goals to reduce these threats.           Hispanics, especially those of Mexican ancestry, are re-shaping the demographic composition of the U.S. Hispanics are the fastest growing demographic group in the country, due to high immigration from Mexico and other Latin American countries, as well as higher fertility rates compared with non-Hispanic Whites and African-Americans (Tienda and Mitchell, 2006).

"Adapting Interventions for Diverse Ethnocultural Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objectives of the scientific meetings comprising this conference, titled ""Adapting Interventions for Diverse Ethnocultural Families,"" are to advance knowledge and methods on integrating cultural constructs into extant interventions. We propose to bring together leading scholars in child and adolescent mental health, behavioral sciences, and intervention research to address five objectives: (1) to generate and refine conceptual models for adaptation that can generalize to diverse groups; (2) to identify and develop theoretically based methodologies for adapting extant interventions; (3) to foster dialogue among intervention developers and intervention adapters on navigating between the core elements of interventions and adaptation processes; (4) to support the development and testing of models, theories and methods for intervention adaptation by investigators, especially junior researchers; and (5) disseminate meeting content through print and state-of-theart electronic media made accessible to the public, clinicians, and investigators around the world through our interactive website.. Previously, we focused on conceptual definitions of cultural constructs and operationalizing them for infusion into interventions. But we discovered that developing models and methods for adaptation science that are far-reaching, beyond just one ethnic group, has potential to advance the science of intervention-adaptation. Through the proposed series of annual meetings we can address several challenges for advancing adaptation science. First, we need to develop comprehensive adaptation models that can absorb the enduring cultural factors as identified by ethnic and cultural groups rather than looking at transitory cultural changes that are less helpful. Each group must undertake this process. Deriving from this, our second challenge is to expand our scope to a multicultural one that includes investigators working with other minority ethnic groups (e.g., African American, American Indian, Asians/Pacific Islanders, refugees and others). Third, extending our conceptual models and population groups also requires attention to designing methodologies to guide intervention-adaptation scientists across ethnocultural groups. Fourth, because adaptation always raises tension between fidelity and fit, we must engage intervention developers in conversations about adaptation. In short, the meetings will encompass models and methods buttressed by scientific evidence, population groups, and intervention-developers to arrive at consensus and products that can be applied across ecological contexts. Through three annual meetings, we address these and other vexing issues. The meetings will be held in early April each year at Washington University in St. Louis. A Steering Committee of mental health services researchers will insure a successful, high quality endeavor. Products will include scientific papers to be published in high impact journals, conference proceedings, NIH grant applications to test adaptation models and methods, and disseminated through sophisticated internet technology.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed meetings will provide methods and models for adapting interventions that will reduce health disparities can be reduced by ensuring their cultural relevance to ethnic minority groups. NIMH's Strategic Plan (2008) calls for developing new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of our citizens and strengthening the application of interventions by examining community and intervention delivery approaches and how they may affect intervention outcomes. Finally, The Road Ahead: Research Partnerships to Transform Services (NIMH, 2006) also recommends that we determine the mechanisms underlying the successful implementation of evidence-based interventions in varying service settings with culturally and ethnically diverse populations.            Project Narrative The proposed meetings will provide methods and models for adapting interventions that will reduce health disparities can be reduced by ensuring their cultural relevance to ethnic minority groups.

"Strategies to Advance the National Research Council's Agenda on Minority Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract On behalf of the NIA Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMARs), with leadership by the RCMAR Coordinating Center (CC), we request funding for an annual series of five scientific research conferences. The content of the series will focus on ""Strategies to Advance the National Research Council's Agenda on Minority Aging"". Key themes and agenda topics will be selected for each conference from the research agenda developed by the National Research Council (NRC), ""Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health in Late Life"" (2004). This conference series provides a translational opportunity to move the NRC's 18 recommendations into the next steps of research development. The 2008 conference will address minority research project recruitment and retention, a cross cutting issue for all NRC recommendations and a topic that the RCMARs have made important contributions to understanding and improving. In a recent analysis for the NIA, we found that faculty from the RCMAR program had produced 78 journal articles and provided 17 scientific presentations on these topics. The 2009 conference will address measurement and methods issues in minority aging research. From recruitment and methods, we move to the issue of intervention development in 2010. For the 2011 conference we will feature the issue of analytic techniques. The 2012 conference will focus on writing skills development and will address the links between macro (policy) systems and individual factors in minority aging research. Thus the five-year series mirrors the key ingredients in translational research: recruitment, methods, intervention development, analysis, and writing for publication and to inform policy. Each of the conferences will generate a number of significant outcomes and products, including: research development training for a minimum of 50 faculty/year; skill building products by each attendee; print and web- based resource materials; video streaming programs; one scientific publication submission per year based on the conference.

"Ninth Annual Conference on Urban Environmental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  At the International Society for Urban Health (ISUH), we are increasingly struck by the contrast between the growing importance of urbanization and the lack of systematic study of the impact of urbanization on health. For this reason, ISUH has been responsible for organizing a series of international conferences on urban health, and is organizing the Ninth International Conference on Urban Health, scheduled to occur during October 27-29, 2010 in New York City.  In this proposal, we seek to enhance the relevance and importance of the Ninth International Conference by creating a specific conference concentration and track on the National Institute Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)-sponsored and NIEHS-pertinent research evidence that will help the conference draw attention to and foster future research collaborations with a specific focus on addressing health disparities in urban areas.  We assert that much can be gained through the exchange of ideas about the physical and social environments of cities and health service, including an international perspective. In the developed world, the built environment of cities can both mitigate and intensify health issues such as obesity, by encouraging or discouraging daily physical activity. Neighborhoods with more toxic social environments can further exacerbate obesity by discouraging outdoor activity and can negatively affect mental health. In the developing world, environmental health hazards are endemic to many urban areas: hastily built slums with poor and dangerous materials; indoor cooking with biofuels; poor sanitation services; and high crime rates. Through environmental health sessions at the conference, we propose to showcase current research on how the built and social environment affects the health of urban populations. As such, we are requesting $30,000 of the total cost of the conference ($350,000), to fund the following environmental health research components of the program: 1) plenary speakers on urban environmental health research, 2) concurrent sessions on environmental health research as applies to cities, 3) poster sessions focused on urban environmental health research, and 4) publication of a supplement of the Journal of Urban Health that will include featured  articles and poster abstracts on environmental health research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By holding this conference in one of the leading cities in the world, we intend to foster an international research group to collectively improve the understanding of the common health risks faced by urban residents and to influence the development of effective public health interventions across the globe. Perspectives and lessons from different countries can be valuable to share. We have now held six prior conferences that have been well attended and look forward to continuing this series.           By holding this conference in one of the leading cities in the world, we intend to foster an international research group to collectively improve the understanding of the common health risks faced by urban residents and to influence the development of effective public health interventions across the globe.

"Aging Research at the 2010 through 2014 ASHEcon Biennial Conferences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The American Society of Health Economists (ASHEcon) is a professional organization dedicated to promoting excellence in health economics research in the U.S. The objective of the ASHEcon conferences is to provide a forum for presenting emerging ideas, empirical results and methodological advances in health economics research and for facilitating the development of the next generation of health economics scholars. More specifically, the goal is to facilitate a large community of health economists to present and discuss high quality papers representing new and innovative research in important areas of health economics. The ultimate outcomes include better research on critical health topics, including aging related topics; generation of new research ideas; development of opportunities for students, junior researchers, women and minorities; dissemination of cutting-edge ideas; and a better knowledge base for private and public policies.  Plenary speakers, scientific sessions, papers, and posters will address the substantive area of aging through several topics. These include: quality of care; health insurance and health care reform; comparative effectiveness; Medicare (e.g., physician and hospital payment reforms, Medicare Advantage, and Part Ds); ethnic/racial and gender disparities in treatments and outcomes; retirement and health; VA services; health and health behaviors across the life-span; long-term care; preventive services for elderly; and diffusion of technology. Pre-conference sessions will explore topics such as new developments in econometric and other methods, and developments in government data availability.  Beginning with the conference at University of Wisconsin in 2006 and then the Duke conference in 2008, ASHEcon's biennial conference has quickly become established as the premier health economics conference in the United States. NIA, through a conference grant, was instrumental in helping the 2008 conference include high quality sessions directly related to aging and a plenary speaker (Mark McClellan) who spoke on health care reform, aging, and policy related issues. Funding for the next three conferences and the intervening planning years will build on our strong record of accomplishment. Research presented at the ASHEcon conferences will help advance NIA's, and more generally, NIH's research agenda. Many of the health economists who will attend are grantees of NIA and, more broadly, NIH; others may become interested in these topics after hearing presentations and discussions. Further, NIA, NIH, and ASHEcon share many goals such as training and developing the careers of students and junior faculty including women and minorities.  The third biennial ASHEcon conference will be held June 20-23, 2010, at Cornell University in Ithaca NY. The fourth conference will be at the University of Minnesota in 2012 and the fifth is to be held in 2014 at a university TBD. We anticipate about 700 participants at the third conference. The 2006 conference had 500 attendees and the 2008 conference had 650 attendees.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the biennial conferences of the American Society of Health Economists (ASHEcon) is to provide a forum for emerging ideas and empirical results of health economics research.

"Realizing the Promise of Community-Engaged Health Disparities Research: A Communi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Collaboration with communities in research occurs along a continuum referred to as community-engaged research. Community-engaged research is increasingly recognized by NIH, researchers and community groups as critical to understanding and addressing differences in health status and health outcomes across race, ethnicity and income status. As a result, more community groups are being approached by researchers who want to conduct research in the communities they serve or have access to, and more community groups are initiating their own research studies. Universities and university-based health disparities researchers have established funding mechanisms for their research roles and networks for professional development, mentoring and advocacy. As more community organizations are engaged in research, it is clear that they need their own such supports. Our proposed conference, ""Realizing the Promise of Community-Engaged Health Disparities Research: A Community Partner Forum,"" will convene experienced and novice community organizations involved in health disparities research to share their experiences, learn from one another, plan ongoing peer support, and make recommendations or practice, research and policy development. Designed ""by and for"" community organizations involved in health disparities research, the conference will examine and address in-depth the challenges and issues they face and enhance their knowledge and skills while simultaneously contribute to building a national community partner network for ongoing shared learning, mentoring and professional development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Community-engaged research is increasingly recognized by NIH, researchers and community groups as critical to achieving health equity across the diverse communities that comprise the United States. By convening community organizations that are involved in community-engaged health disparities research, our proposed conference will help to ensure that communities most affected by health disparities are at the decision making tables that decide what research gets conducted, how and by whom, and that adequate resources are provided for their involvement. As such, the proposed conference seeks to ensure that community-engaged health disparities research in the future can reach its full potential to improve the public's health.            Community-engaged research is increasingly recognized by NIH, researchers and community groups as critical to achieving health equity across the diverse communities that comprise the United States.

"Impact of Man-made Disasters on the Underserved: Lesson Learned from BP Oil Spill    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to plan and implement an international conference and a follow-up scientific meeting to address the human and environmental impact of man-made disasters, with a focus on vulnerable populations and resultant health disparities. This overarching theme will be approached through the prism of the 2010 BP Oil Spill and the lessons learned from the impact of and the response to this disaster, as well as previous man-made disasters.  The specific aims are to bring together regional, national, and international experts and stakeholders to:  1. Address the short- and long-term physical and mental health risks of man-made disasters with special  emphasis on the BP Oil Spill ;  2. Address the environmental impact of man-made disasters and discuss the development and  enforcement of environmental and safety regulations;  3. Address the community and family impact of the BP Oil Spill in terms of social capital and stability;  4. Address the economic impact of man-made disasters, including the need to provide a rapid-response  economic buffer for impacted communities, now and in the future, and a fully funded contingency plan.  The conference will be convened by the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center, the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center of Dillard University/Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, and Jackson State University in Mississippi. The events will be organized by a four-person organizing committee from the four convening institutions. An eight- person advisory committee of national and international experts will provide scientific leadership and direction.  The conference has been planned for January 23-24, 2011 at Dillard University for 100 attendees. It will include plenary sessions on the impact of man-made disasters on human health and the environmental effects and policy implications of man-made disasters, as well as four breakout sessions: human health risks from oil leaks, socioeconomic impacts of oil leaks, environmental impact of oil leaks, and policy perspectives.  The follow-up scientific meeting has been planned for March, 2011 in Gulfport/Biloxi, Mississippi, for 20 attendees. Funding will be provided by the UAB Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center. This meeting will analyze the outcomes of the international conference and will integrate the conclusions from the various themes (health, environment, economics, and public policy) to identify future prospects and challenges. Specifically, it will outline the research agenda, research clusters and facilities, and mechanisms of funding.  The ultimate outcome will be a developed strategy to establish a tri-state (AL, MS, LA) infrastructure for research, training, and community engagement to address both the immediate and the long-term impacts of the BP Oil Spill disaster and help prevent or mitigate the effects of future man-made disasters.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Natural and man-made disasters occur with deadly frequency in the tri-state area (AL, LA, MS). The serial devastation of hurricanes Alex, Katrina, Rita, and Gustav, and now the BP Gulf Oil Spill, has exposed a disaster response system that is seriously inadequate. These disasters are the consequence of emerging disparity populations; therefore the focus of the proposed events is on vulnerable populations and resultant health disparities. The proposed events will provide a first opportunity for the three states to develop a comprehensive approach to addressing both the short- and long-term consequences of the BP Oil Spill and other man-made disasters.           Natural and man-made disasters occur with deadly frequency in the tri-state area (AL, LA, MS).

"Population Center Faculty Meetings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people experience systemic health disparities. A remaining obstacle to growth of our understanding of LGBT health and ability to take steps to address LGBT health disparities is the lack of opportunities for interdisciplinary scientists to meet and exchange ideas about the key issues and methodological challenges in understanding sexual and gender minorities (SGM). The proposed annual Scientific Meeting in LGBT Population Health Research sponsored by The Center for Population Research in LGBT Health (the Center) at The Fenway Institute of Fenway Health will fill this gap. To be held annually in the summer at Fenway Health's Conference Center in Boston, Massachusetts, the Scientific Meeting will draw together a diverse national group of experts and promising new scientists to advance the state of the science in the study of SGM population health. Each meeting will share the core objectives to 1) exchange information about the most recent developments in SGM population health; 2) coordinate cooperative research endeavors in SGM health through Working Groups sponsored by the Center; and 3) explore and seek solutions to methodological challenges in studying and estimating SGM population groups. In response to ongoing advances in the field, an Organizing Committee will annually select focused and timely topics to be addressed at each meeting by the invited speakers and key meeting participants. Areas of focus for the 2010 meeting include the health of SGM racial minority groups, chronic conditions and disabilities in older sexual and gender minorities, and child development in families parented by lesbians and gay men. The format of the proposed 2010 meeting includes scientific presentations by invited speakers, presentations of work in progress from faculty leaders of the Center, discussions of methodological problems and solutions, and working group breakout sessions. Meeting participants will include the faculty of the Center, graduate student mentees enrolled in the Center's Mentoring and Training Program, community research partners and other research collaborators. Keynote scientific presentations will be open to the public and advertised to the LGBT community. The format for subsequent meetings is expected to be similar to the proposed 2010 meeting, but will be adjusted by the Organizing Committee in response to evaluation feedback from the previous year.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Scientific Meeting will contribute to an understanding of the behavioral and social science aspects of human development. The Meeting will complement activities at Fenway Community Health funded by a Population Research Infrastructure Program award from NICHD (R21HD051178).

"Strategies to Advance the National Research Council's Agenda on Minority Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract On behalf of the NIA Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMARs), with leadership by the RCMAR Coordinating Center (CC), we request funding for an annual series of five scientific research conferences. The content of the series will focus on ""Strategies to Advance the National Research Council's Agenda on Minority Aging"". Key themes and agenda topics will be selected for each conference from the research agenda developed by the National Research Council (NRC), ""Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health in Late Life"" (2004). This conference series provides a translational opportunity to move the NRC's 18 recommendations into the next steps of research development. The 2008 conference will address minority research project recruitment and retention, a cross cutting issue for all NRC recommendations and a topic that the RCMARs have made important contributions to understanding and improving. In a recent analysis for the NIA, we found that faculty from the RCMAR program had produced 78 journal articles and provided 17 scientific presentations on these topics. The 2009 conference will address measurement and methods issues in minority aging research. From recruitment and methods, we move to the issue of intervention development in 2010. For the 2011 conference we will feature the issue of analytic techniques. The 2012 conference will focus on writing skills development and will address the links between macro (policy) systems and individual factors in minority aging research. Thus the five-year series mirrors the key ingredients in translational research: recruitment, methods, intervention development, analysis, and writing for publication and to inform policy. Each of the conferences will generate a number of significant outcomes and products, including: research development training for a minimum of 50 faculty/year; skill building products by each attendee; print and web- based resource materials; video streaming programs; one scientific publication submission per year based on the conference. Relevance to Public Health The reduction of health status disparities is one of the two major goals for Healthy People 2010 (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 2000). This conference series promotes skills, knowledge and abilities of researchers to address health disparities in their work.                    Relevance to Public Health The reduction of health status disparities is one of the two major goals for Healthy People 2010 (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 2000).

"Adapting Interventions for Diverse Ethnocultural Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objectives of the scientific meetings comprising this conference, titled ""Adapting Interventions for Diverse Ethnocultural Families,"" are to advance knowledge and methods on integrating cultural constructs into extant interventions. We propose to bring together leading scholars in child and adolescent mental health, behavioral sciences, and intervention research to address five objectives: (1) to generate and refine conceptual models for adaptation that can generalize to diverse groups; (2) to identify and develop theoretically based methodologies for adapting extant interventions; (3) to foster dialogue among intervention developers and intervention adapters on navigating between the core elements of interventions and adaptation processes; (4) to support the development and testing of models, theories and methods for intervention adaptation by investigators, especially junior researchers; and (5) disseminate meeting content through print and state-of-theart electronic media made accessible to the public, clinicians, and investigators around the world through our interactive website.. Previously, we focused on conceptual definitions of cultural constructs and operationalizing them for infusion into interventions. But we discovered that developing models and methods for adaptation science that are far-reaching, beyond just one ethnic group, has potential to advance the science of intervention-adaptation. Through the proposed series of annual meetings we can address several challenges for advancing adaptation science. First, we need to develop comprehensive adaptation models that can absorb the enduring cultural factors as identified by ethnic and cultural groups rather than looking at transitory cultural changes that are less helpful. Each group must undertake this process. Deriving from this, our second challenge is to expand our scope to a multicultural one that includes investigators working with other minority ethnic groups (e.g., African American, American Indian, Asians/Pacific Islanders, refugees and others). Third, extending our conceptual models and population groups also requires attention to designing methodologies to guide intervention-adaptation scientists across ethnocultural groups. Fourth, because adaptation always raises tension between fidelity and fit, we must engage intervention developers in conversations about adaptation. In short, the meetings will encompass models and methods buttressed by scientific evidence, population groups, and intervention-developers to arrive at consensus and products that can be applied across ecological contexts. Through three annual meetings, we address these and other vexing issues. The meetings will be held in early April each year at Washington University in St. Louis. A Steering Committee of mental health services researchers will insure a successful, high quality endeavor. Products will include scientific papers to be published in high impact journals, conference proceedings, NIH grant applications to test adaptation models and methods, and disseminated through sophisticated internet technology.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed meetings will provide methods and models for adapting interventions that will reduce health disparities can be reduced by ensuring their cultural relevance to ethnic minority groups. NIMH's Strategic Plan (2008) calls for developing new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of our citizens and strengthening the application of interventions by examining community and intervention delivery approaches and how they may affect intervention outcomes. Finally, The Road Ahead: Research Partnerships to Transform Services (NIMH, 2006) also recommends that we determine the mechanisms underlying the successful implementation of evidence-based interventions in varying service settings with culturally and ethnically diverse populations.            Project Narrative The proposed meetings will provide methods and models for adapting interventions that will reduce health disparities can be reduced by ensuring their cultural relevance to ethnic minority groups.

"2011 Gordon Research Conference on Nitric Oxide    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Gordon Research Conference on Nitric Oxide (NO) is designed to provide chemists, biologists, clinicians and other scientists with state-of-the-art knowledge on the basic structure/function relationships of NO generating systems, and the biology of NO as a signaling and effector molecule in physiology and pathophysiology. This research conference is held every two years and the next conference will take place at the Four Points Sheraton/Holiday Inn Express in Ventura, CA on Feb 13-18, 2011. Approximately 150 participants from academia, government and industry are expected to attend this conference. Funds are requested to support travel costs and conference registration fees for participants (i.e. speakers/discussion leaders from the United States and abroad and for exceptional graduate students/post-doctoral candidates and other junior scientists working in the field of NO biology). The speakers have been selected to address unresolved questions and cover emerging new areas in the field and to balance the program with senior and junior investigators. Sessions will include a side-by-side comparison of bacterial, plant and mammalian NO producing and sensing systems; their involvement in regulating substrate utilization, intermediary metabolism, and mechanisms of coping with oxygen shortage; and the signal transduction pathways involved. In addition, novel therapeutic avenues will be covered with an emphasis on understanding the molecular processes involved. Carl Nathan has kindly agreed to present the Keynote Lecture. Although this meeting does not focus on infectious disease, he will touch in his presentation on many of the mechanistic aspects covered in individual sessions in other contexts, adding distinction to the meeting and offering a unique learning opportunity for those in attendance. In addition, there are two prominently featured and moderated poster sessions selected from abstracts submitted to the meeting, a special session on ""Current Controversies and Late-Breaking Findings"" and a ""Hot Topics"" session that encourages last-minute submissions of exciting findings from new or established investigators culminating in awards given to several of the junior investigators. The main strength of this meeting is the opportunity for cross-disciplinary interactions in a highly focused, yet informal intellectually stimulating atmosphere. The Gordon Conference on NO plays an essential role in providing guidance and exploring new vistas in this important field of basic and translational research.           Project Narrative Nitric oxide (NO) is a pluripotent signaling and effector molecule that controls several basic cellular functions including mitochondrial respiration, cell division, and cell survival, and is involved in the regulation and modulation of complex organ functions. The pathways and mechanisms of generation, sensing and regulation of local availability as well as the various biological responses to NO are essential to our understanding of fundamental physiological/pathophysiological processes in the cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems. Conference participants will present and discuss the latest research findings from bacterial, plant and mammalian systems with a view to identify overarching principles of regulation and elucidate the molecular basis for the formation and biological action of NO pertinent to human health and disease.",2011 Gordon Research Conference on Nitric Oxide,8116107,R13HL108339,"['lectures ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Government ', ' Academia ', ' planetary Atmosphere ', ' Atmosphere ', ' posters ', ' Industry ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' graduate student ', ' Travel ', ' Motivation ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Side ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' cost ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Fostering ', ' Cell division ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Woman ', ' Organ ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Generations ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Chemistry ', ' Award ', ' Individual ', ' Population ', ' Address ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction Pathway ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Plants ', ' response ', ' meetings ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Process ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Area ', ' Regulation ', ' Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Learning ', ' Molecular ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Medical ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' base ', ' Research ', ' Minority ', ' Physiology ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' United States ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Biology ', ' Complex ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Participant ', ' Work ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Oxygen ', ' O2 element ', ' O element ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Play ', ' Biological ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' abstracting ', ' Funding ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' coping mechanism ', ' Fees ', ' Clinical Pharmacology ', ' Holidays ', ' ']",NHLBI,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2011,15000,0.12481726022125268

"Primary Care and Prevention Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) proposes the convening of the Annual Primary Care and Prevention Conference. This conference, attended by clinicians, researchers and other healthcare/ professionals for the last eight years, provides a continuing education opportunity for translating research into practice (best science to best-practice) for our national audience, as well as a bi-directional opportunity for front-line best practice to better inform researchers and policy-makers. We project that during the next three years, conference activities and inter-conference activities would reach more than 1,000 conference participants and another 10-15,000 individuals through conference dissemination activities. The purpose of the conference and its activities is threefold: 1) to synthesize, summarize, and communicate research findings to a broad range of organizations and individuals who can improve the health outcomes of their patients; 2) to develop national strategies for translating and disseminating research to public and private decision makers; and 3) to form collaborative partnerships that support local initiatives and healthcare providers in reaching out to under-served communities. The first year's proposed three-day meeting would take place from September 22nd through September 24th, 2010 in Atlanta, Georgia. The event will offer evidence-based primary care clinical updates, cutting edge theory in public health, and opportunities for practitioners to interact with a wide range of participants from community, academic, and other backgrounds. This combination of content and mission has become the hallmark of this primary care and prevention meeting and, according to evaluation reports, is the element that will make it different and useful to the 400 expected participants. The meeting agenda will offer sessions focused on health disparities related to gender, race and ethnicity, income and education, disability, rural health, and sexual orientation. Programming will also cover many of the 28 Healthy People 2010 focus areas including: access to quality health services; cancer; chronic kidney disease; diabetes; disability and secondary conditions; heart disease and stroke; HIV; immunizations and infectious disease; maternal, infant, and child health; mental health; nutrition and overweight; physical activity and fitness; public health infrastructure; substance abuse; tobacco use; and vision and hearing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEAVANCE: As with past conferences, Morehouse School of Medicine faculty members and our community-clinician partners propose to plan this ninth year conference as a ""bidirectional learning experience"" between academic experts and front-line clinician-experts for evidenced based primary care and public health strategies and interventions especially focused on improving health outcomes in and with high-disparity communities. To address the Healthy People 2010 (HP2010) goals and to meet needs cited by participants of past conferences, the programming committee will focus on health disparities related to gender, race and ethnicity, income and education, disability, and rural health. The event will offer evidence-based primary care clinical updates, cutting edge theory in public health, and opportunities for practitioners to interact with a wide range of participants from community, academic, and other backgrounds.           Narrative As with past conferences, Morehouse School of Medicine faculty members and our community-clinician partners propose to plan this ninth year conference as a ""bidirectional learning experience"" between academic experts and front-line clinician-experts for evidenced based primary care and public health strategies and interventions especially focused on improving health outcomes in and with high-disparity communities.

"Navigating the Currents of Change Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Association for Rural Mental Health (NARMH) and AgriWellness, Inc. request financial support from the AHRQ to hold our first joint conference on June 22 - 25, 2011 at Dubuque, IA. The NARMH is an interdisciplinary organization with approximately 420 members that was founded in 1977 to develop and enhance rural mental health and substance abuse services and to support behavioral healthcare providers in rural areas. Recognizing the role that consumers and their families play in recovery, the NARMH has proactively supported initiatives that strengthen the voices of rural consumers and their families to carry out its mission: ""linking voices to promote rural mental health."" AgriWellness, Inc. is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 2001 to coordinate the provision of behavioral health supports to persons involved in agriculture in the upper Midwest. The organization has become a leading voice for agricultural people throughout the U.S. The AgriWellness mission is to ""promote accessible behavioral health services for underserved and at-risk populations affected by rural crisis in agricultural communities."" The NARMH has held a conference yearly since 1979. AgriWellness, Inc. has sponsored four biannual conferences called ""The Clock is Ticking for Rural America: A Behavioral Health and Safety Conference."" Capitalizing on their strengths, both organizations determined to join together for their 2011 conference. The primary objective of the conference is the dissemination and implementation of research findings and evidence-based information and tools. Research development, research training, infrastructure and career development are secondary but integral purposes of the conferences. Navigating the Currents of Change aims to improve behavioral healthcare of an AHRQ priority population: residents of rural areas, including those designated as frontiers and the special populations who live in rural areas, including children, the elderly, persons involved in agriculture who have behavioral healthcare needs associated with their occupation, persons with disabilities and those who need chronic behavioral healthcare. This conference addresses the significant unmet or underserved needs of rural and agricultural residents for behavioral healthcare. The conference seeks to enhance research and service delivery in five main conference tracks:  7 Responding to the increasing diversity of rural and agricultural people;  7 Reducing the growing disparities in delivering behavioral healthcare to rural America;  7 Enhancing disaster behavioral health services in rural areas;  7 Responding to the special issues of deployed soldiers as they return to their families and rural  communities; and  7 Understanding and reducing domestic violence in rural America. The conference organizers will undertake a comprehensive evaluation that determines how well the conference meets the needs of its estimated 265 participants and the extent to which they indicate advances in knowledge and skills. The participants will be asked to complete conference and individual session evaluations.

"Network for Justice Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The U.S. Justice system controls nearly 8 million young people and adults on any given day, and disproportionately touches the lives of minority and disadvantaged populations. The Network for Justice Health was established by Drs. Catherine A Gallagher and Faye S. Taxman at George Mason University to attend to the unmet public health needs of an underserved population. With the partnership of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Center for Outcomes and Evidence (COE), the Network for Justice Health will the goal of on-going open-access dissemination of conference-generated resources. The Network for Justice Health aims to create a global 'collaboratory' of researchers and policy makers addressing health and health care issues of justice-involved populations. The Network is built around these principles: 1) Mounting evidence suggests that individuals involved in the justice system have higher rates of unresolved physical and mental health disorders than their counterparts in the general population; 2) The evidence-base has not been adequately developed to describe the prevalence of the problem, the practices and treatments needed to address the problems, nor the policies to support improvements in health outcomes, nor has the potential of existing evidence been fully realized; 3) Initial studies demonstrate that the justice system does not provide adequate care to improve the overall functioning of this population; and, 4) Health care providers often do not have adequate evidence-based clinical guidelines for addressing and improving health and health-related outcomes (see, e.g., American Pediatric Association, 2001). This will move the field forward in establishing evidence-based guidelines for this medically complex and typically underserved population so that health and health-related outcomes may be improved. The anticipated conference related products may be divided into four components. The first product will be the generation of a research strategy across the relevant domains (defined below) and a timeline and grading scheme for assessing progress. The second set of products includes documentation and distribution of conference-related materials, including summaries of conference proceedings. Webinars will also be available to those unable to participate. Web-conferencing will also be available for post-meeting follow-up and ongoing committee meetings. A third set of products are aimed at the research and policy community, and include a series of invited articles in a special journal issue, a review article on evidence-based practice (EBP) for justice involved individuals by members of the Network for Justice Health such as co-directors Catherine Gallagher and Faye Taxman. The final will be an open-access, web-based resources for individuals around the country and globe. These will include a compilation of existing research and evidence on justice health topics, access to coded bibliographic information for rapid and free evidence searching, and automated mapping and graphing programming that will provide visual displays of knowledge areas and gaps across conditions, populations, and settings related to justice health. Support for three conferences is requested through AHRQ conference grants (February 23-26, 2010 in Phoenix AZ; February 22-25, 2011, Los Angeles; & February 21-24, 2012, Washington, D.C.)      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The 8 million people controlled by the U.S. Justice system on any given day have much higher rates of unresolved physical and mental health disorders than their counterparts in the general population.

"PRIDE COORDINATION CENTER    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary:  This application seeks to address the organizational and support needs of several training programs that are engaged in efforts to increase diversity among scientists doing biomedical research (called PRIDE). The PRIDE programs conduct mentored Summer Institutes that are designed to enhance the career development of minority junior faculty and scientists by further developing their research skills and knowledge. This project will serve as the coordination core (CC) to support these training programs. The CC will facilitate the education and evaluation activities among programs by designing and overseeing a web-based infrastructure does the following. (1) Recruitment and outreach: The CC will use web-based informatics methods to develop and coordinate outreach efforts to recruit trainees to the Summer Institute programs. (2) Mentoring and Networking: The CC will coordinate efforts to identify mentors for the trainees (mentoring teams), to develop and conduct training workshops for the mentoring teams, to evaluate the effectiveness of the mentoring teams, and to identify and disseminate information on additional training and networking opportunities for the trainees. (3) Meetings: The CC will handle all plans and logistics for the CC to site-visit each program and for at least two annual meetings to be held in the Washington DC area. One annual meeting will be attended by the PIs and NHLBI staff (directors meeting) and another by all the NHLBI and program staff, faculty, mentees and mentors (Annual PRIDE Conference). (4) Communications: The CC will handle all communications including coordinating conference calls, recording and distributing minutes of calls and meetings, and creating web- based resources for program-wide needs such as posting directories, NIH policies and procedures, recruiting and application materials, newsletters, funding opportunities, and announcements. (5) Evaluations and Tracking: The CC will facilitate the development of a web-based evaluations and tracking protocol for the entire consortium, including a proposal to track mentees from a previous NHLBI-supported study (SIPID). Finally, the CC will facilitate the production of analyses and reports documenting the progress of the PRIDE efforts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is well known that CVD disproportionately affects minorities, and yet recruiting minorities into these research studies has been difficult.

"Conference grant application to support the American Psychosomatic Society's 69th    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Providing strong support and guidance to promising pre- and post-doctoral students is crucial for the advancement of all fields of science. The overall goal of this competing renewal of R13 HL074923 is to provide travel support for trainees to attend and actively take part in the 69th Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society (APS) in San Antonio, Texas (March 9 - 12, 2011). The essential mission of the APS is to promote and advance the scientific understanding of the interrelationships among biological, psychological, social and behavioral factors in human health and disease, and the integration of the fields of science that separately examine each, and to foster the application of this understanding in education and improved health care. This mission is instantiated in the selection of the theme for the 2011 meeting, ""Understanding Mechanisms and Improving Interventions,"" which will highlight empirical research and clinical applications along the translational continuum. For greater than 60 years, the annual APS meeting has provided an outstanding forum for trainees and established investigators and clinicians working within a wide range of disciplines and specialty areas to exchange new ideas and research strategies that ultimately facilitate and improve the quality of research and its translation into clinical practice and public policy. The annual APS meeting is attended by over 500 researchers and clinicians from around the world. In this competing renewal, we propose to provide support for up to 15 Young Scholar Awards and 5 Minority Initiative Travel Awards. The Young Scholars Award Program will provide travel awards to competitively- selected trainees who submit a first-author abstract to present a paper or poster and who are judged to show outstanding potential for a career in psychosomatic and behavioral medicine. The APS Minority Initiative Travel Award will provide support for promising trainees from racial/ethnic or other underrepresented groups to attend the annual meeting. The process of identifying and selecting APS Minority Initiative Travel Award recipients will differ, as this award seeks to extend trainee award opportunities to individuals who are not yet ""stakeholders"" in the process. The meeting's location in San Antonio will capitalize on regional expertise in Latino health and health disparities, which has not been strongly represented on previous programs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Providing strong support and guidance to promising pre- and post-doctoral students is crucial for the advancement of all fields of science.

"Research Colloquium for Junior Investigators     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks support for a research colloquium for junior investigators held during the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). This annual event has taken place in each of the past 15 years under the sponsorship of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) with administrative direction from the American Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education (APIRE). Primary specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) identify current and future senior psychiatric residents, research fellows and junior faculty psychiatrists (with special emphasis on ethnic/racial minorities and women) who are promising candidates for successful research careers; (2) provide a one-day intensive, mentored, training session that will allow these participants to present their current or proposed research protocols in small group sessions and; (3) to receive faculty mentoring and peer feedback. Additional specific aims are to: (1) encourage colloquium participants to maintain a research career path and; (2) provide information and resources that will enable them to obtain outside funding and launch successful research careers, as measured by the receipt of grant support, publication in peer-reviewed journals, and academic appointments at research institutions. The colloquium is designed around a one-day workshop that is held annually on the Sunday that ends the meeting of the Society for Biological Psychiatry and begins the APA annual meeting. A total of 54 junior investigators will be selected to participate and will meet in small groups of three to five traines and two faculty, where the trainees will provide a 15-20 minute presentation of their current or proposed study. Participants will also be required to present a poster during a noon poster session where they will receive additional faculty mentoring. NIMH currently is able to provide support for the colloquium every other year. This submission seeks support to maintain the colloquium on an annual basis. The current proposal further extends this well-established and highly regarded program by expanding the emphasis on minority researchers, focusing specific content on disparities in health care research, and providing opportunities throughout the year for participants to have ""booster sessions"" through access to an interactive research training website. This website has been developed with support from a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contract on which APIRE has served as sub-contractor. The website, near completion, provides lectures, power-point presentations, case-studies, self-assessment questions, and opportunities for threaded discussions on an array of research content, including statistical consultation, writing research proposals, critically appraising the research literature and research ethics. This submission also includes responses from a survey of former Colloquium participants, highlighting their academic and research achievements.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Research Colloquium is a one day conference that is held during the APA annual meeting for psychiatry residents, research fellows, and junior faculty that are starting research careers to meet with senior research mentors to receive advice on their planned research studies.

"First Bioethics Conference on Cancer Health Disparities Research: Celebrating Sch     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2005, Morehouse School of Medicine, Tuskegee University, and University of Alabama at Birmingham, three schools with different institutional cultures, characters, and resources agreed to collaborate in efforts to eliminate the gap in cancer burden. Pursuing this laudable aim predictably involved some communication challenges. The Partnership is made up of eight components: (1) Scientific Research, (2) Research Training and Career Development, (3) Cancer Education, (4) Community Outreach, (5) Recruitment, and (6) Evaluation, (7) Biostatistics, and (8) Bioethics. Biostatistics and Bioethics served as shared resources within the Partnership. Guided by the ethical and bioethical expertise and conscience of the Tuskegee University National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care, the Bioethics Shared Resource (BESR) has been instrumental in helping the Partnership endure and progress through its growing pains (Sodeke, Turner, and Tarver 2010). Because of such a record, the Partnership's Program Steering Committee and the Project Officer at NCI strongly encouraged the BESR group to host a national conference, designed to assist others in addressing the ethical issues that cancer health disparities research raise. To this end, we respond to PA-10- 071 NIH R13 Support for Conferences and Scientific Meetings. The specific aims of the First Bioethics Conference on Cancer Health Disparities Research to be held at Tuskegee in January 2012 are: (1) Broaden participants' understanding of ethical issues specific to cancer health disparities research, (2) Demonstrate awareness of various stakeholders and perspectives impacting resolution of the ethical issues, (3) Gain a better understanding of how cancer health disparities research can be ethically conducted to eliminate disparities with due attention to contextual issues, individual interest, and entrenched community values, and (4) Plan to engage the knowledge and transforming experience gained to eliminate cancer health disparities in home institutions or new environments. Attendees will be engaged in experimental and experiential learning with the opportunity to present their experimental work and interact with peers to sort out the ethical issues raised by such work in a supportive environment. To engage the emotions and stimulate various ethical perspectives of the attendees, we will use a theatrical act of the life and connectedness of Henrietta Lacks performed by two professional actresses; and a HeLa Cell Exhibit to be designed and mounted by the Legacy Museum of Tuskegee University, followed by facilitated deep reflections and ethical analyses. We expect these immersion experiences to be transformative for participants, such that their increased sensitivity to the plight of others can inform their plans for improved moral judgments pertaining to ethical issues in cancer health disparities research. We plan to publish the proceedings of the conference in a professional journal such as the Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Research in cancer health disparities raises many ethical issues researchers must address in efforts to eliminate the disparities. Creative methods that are responsive to issues of race, ethnicity, gender, class, and spirituality of research participans as well as those of investigators, are required to understand and resolve relevant ethical issues. The proposed Bioethics Conference immersion experiences will likely result in increased sensitivity to the plight of others, and can inform attendees' plans for improved moral judgments as they do their work in new environments or home institutions.                   Research in cancer health disparities raises many ethical issues researchers must address in efforts to eliminate the disparities.

"Hampton University Skin of Color Research Institute Skin of Color Symposium 2011:    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People with skin of color make up a broad range of ethnic groups including African Americans, Asians, Native Americans, and Hispanics. Population-based statistics from U.S. Census Bureau estimates that ethnic minorities will represent more than one-half of the U.S. population by the year 2050, yet there is significant disparity in the prevalence, clinical presentation, morbidity, and mortality associated with certain skin conditions in people of color compared to whites. The 2nd Annual Hampton University Skin of Color Research Institute (HUSCRI) ""Skin of Color Symposium 2011: From Benchtop to Bedside-Future Directions"" is a unique Symposium designed to promote, develop and advance education, knowledge, research and treatment in cutaneous diseases involving ethnic populations. It will feature a multidisciplinary program of speakers providing the latest information in medical dermatology, epidemiology, basic research, diagnosis and treatment of conditions that disproportionately impact ethnic minority populations. Invited speakers during this 2-day symposium include leaders from a variety of scientific disciplines relevant to skin of color and foster an exchange of information between physicians, basic scientists, and health professionals. Covered topics include cutaneous lupus, melanocytic disorders, keloids/wound healing, aging, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, malignant melanoma, optical properties of skin and advanced imaging techniques in skin of color. Aims of the Symposium are to: 1) Nurture collaborative relationships among diverse parties within the field by providing a forum to share the latest information on basic biology, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatments for ethnically based dermatologic diseases and integrate this data into clinical practice and new research directions; 2) Promote the dissemination of the latest research findings to the scientific and medical communities;3) Increase the attendance of underrepresented minorities at dermatologic conferences and their participation in research; 4) Improve success of minority junior investigators in securing funding by providing grant-writing assistance; and 5) Introduce new research directions and collaborations to address rare and/or serious skin conditions for skin of color. The targeted audience for this Symposium is a multidisciplinary mix of ~150 clinicians, researchers, and other health professionals, with special emphasis on attracting minority and other researchers from under-represented groups. Ninety-nine percent of attendees at the 2010 Symposium indicated that attending the conference increased both their knowledge and competence, and would enhance their performance and positively impact their patient practice.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: People with skin of color make up a broad range of ethnic groups and races including Africans, African Americans, Asians, Native Americans, and Hispanics.

"AACR Conference on The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Mino    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed conference will be the fourth in an AACR series focused specifically on the science of cancer health disparities. The previous conferences on The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved were held November 27-30, 2007, February 3-6, 2009, and September 30-October 3, 2010 and attendance has steadily grown each year. Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer rates are well documented. While data suggest that access to quality care contributes to cancer disparities, other factors also play a major role, including tumor biology, genetics, hormonal status, lifestyle and behavior, screening policies, comorbidities, environmental exposure and risk, quality of and response to therapy, and post- therapeutic surveillance. The goal of this conference and the conference series is to bring together scientists and other professionals working in a variety of disciplines to discuss the latest findings in the field and to stimulate the development of new research in cancer health disparities. Transdisciplinary interactions between a variety of disciplines including basic science, clinical research, population science, behavioral research, and cancer survivorship, are needed to move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating disparities as they relate to cancer.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer incidence and death statistics show that certain racial and ethnic groups in the United States suffer disproportionately from cancer and its associated effects. Although some disparities may be explained by socioeconomic factors, there is a biological basis as well. For example, research has identified differences in hormonal status and a number of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants that are more common among African Americans. Differences in inherited susceptibilities and molecular pathways for pathogenesis have been implicated as a source of prostate cancer disparities. There is a need to bring together scientists, physicians, and other health professionals to foster discussions and collaborations that will move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating cancer health disparities.           Cancer incidence and death statistics show that certain racial and ethnic groups in the United States suffer disproportionately from cancer and its associated effects.

"Engaging HBCU Faculty in the Development of a National Research Agenda to Achieve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Conference Title: Rehabilitative Health and Health Disparities: A Call to Action for Rehabilitation Faculty at HBCUs ABSTRACT The purpose of this grant proposal is to seek funding to assist in the implementation of a conference that will facilitate the development of a research agenda to address rehabilitation specific health disparity issues in African American communities. Specifically, this conference will seek to engage rehabilitation faculty at the 20 historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) with rehabilitation programs and six (6) professional associations in the creation of a research agenda related to rehabilitative health and health disparities. For the purposes of this conference, rehabilitation programs includes the 37 programs in occupational therapy, physical therapy, prosthetics and orthotics, rehabilitation counseling, and speech language-pathology that are housed at HBCUs. Significant research on the health disparities affecting African Americans and other minority communities is presented in the literature. However, little investigation has addressed the role of rehabilitation providers in the health disparity of African American rehabilitative health. Much of the available research on the topic has focused on physician directed intervention, health policy, and on differences among groups of individuals. Information regarding the effect of biases, education, and professional roles and responsibilities of rehabilitation providers on service provision is lacking. Faculty at HBCUs are uniquely positioned to address and to seek avenues to promote health equity for African Americans. This conference will serve to empower participants to contribute to the development of a research agenda that will be shared with other faculty, students and professional associations. It is expected that a research agenda for rehabilitative health and health disparities, which specifically addresses the African American community, will be created when rehabilitation faculty from HBCUs and representatives of related associations are brought together for that purpose. The specific aims of this conference are to: 1) develop a national research agenda that addresses rehabilitative health and health disparities by faculty of HBCUs with rehabilitation programs; 2) create a network of faculty members and others who collectively work to improve health equity for African Americans in rehabilitation settings; and 3) facilitate faculty development through collaborative efforts. Results of the conference will be published online and in print. Funding for this conference will support up to $800 in travel and housing for at least 43 faculty members, six (6) association representatives and seven (7) facilitators. More participants will be funded if costs allow. This conference will be hosted by the Center to Advance Rehabilitative Health and Education (CARE) and the College of Health Sciences at Alabama State University in Montgomery, Alabama.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance: Annually, millions of individuals receive rehabilitation services provided by occupational therapists, physical therapists, prosthetists/orthotists, rehabilitation counselors, and speech- language pathologists who address health related needs. Disparities in healthcare are well documented. However, little is known about the relationship between services offered by rehabilitation professionals and health disparities, especially for African Americans.           Relevance: Annually, millions of individuals receive rehabilitation services provided by occupational therapists, physical therapists, prosthetists/orthotists, rehabilitation counselors, and speech- language pathologists who address health related needs.

"Aging Research at the 2010 through 2014 ASHEcon Biennial Conferences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The American Society of Health Economists (ASHEcon) is a professional organization dedicated to promoting excellence in health economics research in the U.S. The objective of the ASHEcon conferences is to provide a forum for presenting emerging ideas, empirical results and methodological advances in health economics research and for facilitating the development of the next generation of health economics scholars. More specifically, the goal is to facilitate a large community of health economists to present and discuss high quality papers representing new and innovative research in important areas of health economics. The ultimate outcomes include better research on critical health topics, including aging related topics; generation of new research ideas; development of opportunities for students, junior researchers, women and minorities; dissemination of cutting-edge ideas; and a better knowledge base for private and public policies.  Plenary speakers, scientific sessions, papers, and posters will address the substantive area of aging through several topics. These include: quality of care; health insurance and health care reform; comparative effectiveness; Medicare (e.g., physician and hospital payment reforms, Medicare Advantage, and Part Ds); ethnic/racial and gender disparities in treatments and outcomes; retirement and health; VA services; health and health behaviors across the life-span; long-term care; preventive services for elderly; and diffusion of technology. Pre-conference sessions will explore topics such as new developments in econometric and other methods, and developments in government data availability.  Beginning with the conference at University of Wisconsin in 2006 and then the Duke conference in 2008, ASHEcon's biennial conference has quickly become established as the premier health economics conference in the United States. NIA, through a conference grant, was instrumental in helping the 2008 conference include high quality sessions directly related to aging and a plenary speaker (Mark McClellan) who spoke on health care reform, aging, and policy related issues. Funding for the next three conferences and the intervening planning years will build on our strong record of accomplishment. Research presented at the ASHEcon conferences will help advance NIA's, and more generally, NIH's research agenda. Many of the health economists who will attend are grantees of NIA and, more broadly, NIH; others may become interested in these topics after hearing presentations and discussions. Further, NIA, NIH, and ASHEcon share many goals such as training and developing the careers of students and junior faculty including women and minorities.  The third biennial ASHEcon conference will be held June 20-23, 2010, at Cornell University in Ithaca NY. The fourth conference will be at the University of Minnesota in 2012 and the fifth is to be held in 2014 at a university TBD. We anticipate about 700 participants at the third conference. The 2006 conference had 500 attendees and the 2008 conference had 650 attendees.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the biennial conferences of the American Society of Health Economists (ASHEcon) is to provide a forum for emerging ideas and empirical results of health economics research.

"Bridging the Transition to Life After Cancer Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on the 2006 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, ""From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Translation"", the Minnesota Cancer Alliance (www.mncanceralliance.org) and the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota (www.cancer.umn.edu) are proposing an educational conference for health care professionals on helping their cancer patients successfully navigate the transition from cancer treatment to life after treatment. The National Cancer Institute's Office of Cancer Survivorship Research states that ""an individual is considered a cancer survivor from the time of diagnosis, through the balance of his or her life"". It has been estimated that as of January 2006, 11.4 million Americans (3.8% of the population) met the definition of a cancer survivor, and with advances in early detection and treatment cancers, the number of cancer survivors is expected to grow. The projected shortage of oncologists in the coming years combined with an aging population has led many in the cancer survivorship community to consider alternatives to oncologist-led care for the growing numbers of cancer survivors, including ""shared-care"" where a patient is managed by two or more medical specialties, nurse-led models of survivorship care, and specialized survivorship clinics providing multidisciplinary care in one setting. In addition, other health care professionals, including nurses, physical therapists, social workers, and dietitians, are beginning to define their role in the cancer survivorship care team. With the proposed 2-day conference, we plan to bring oncologists, primary care and family practice physicians, nurses and allied health professionals together to learn about the needs of patients transitioning from active cancer treatment to life beyond cancer, and the resources available to meet those needs. We are also especially interested in encouraging women, racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and teams of health care professionals from medically underserved areas and populations to attend the conference. We anticipate being able to offer a number of registration waivers for minority health care providers, those who provide health care to minorities, or those who practice in Health Professional Shortage Areas. Priority and registration discounts will be offered for multidisciplinary groups of 4 or more professionals (preferably including at least one MD and one RN) from the same institution or community to encourage the formation and implementation of a team approach to providing survivorship care services following the conference.

"International Conference on the Genetics of the Peoples of Africa and the Transat    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This conference proposal requests NIH funding to advance the developing areas of African human genetics and genomics, particularly as they relate to health disparities research. We are seeking support for a 2-day International Conference on the Genetics of the Peoples of Africa and the Transatlantic African Diaspora to be held March 19-20, 2012 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The conference will accomplish its objectives through funding of the travel, room, board, and conference materials and registration costs of 40 established and emerging scholar-speakers, and scholarships for 60 post-doctoral scientists, junior faculty, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates (many from groups underrepresented in the sciences), for a total of 100 invited participants. We expect that the total conference audience will be 200 individuals.  The overall objective of this conference is to bring together leading scholars to provide a comprehensive assessment of the genetics and genomics of the peoples of Africa and of the Transatlantic African Diaspora. The theme of this conference is unique in that it seeks to unite, for two days, scholars working directly in genetics and genomics with scholars in affiliated disciplines to more fully understand the broader context within which the latest genetic and genomic technologies and findings among African peoples should be interpreted and applied, particularly in areas of relevance to understanding and resolving health disparities. The scope, content, and format of this international conference promise to make it both unique and timely. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that the interface of genetics/genomics and health disparities has been considered in African-descended groups on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Indeed, conferences that focus on the application of genetic/genomic technologies to continental Africans and African-descended persons in the Americas are uncommon in the United States. Given the recent availability and future releases of increased coverage in global genetic diversity from projects such as the International HapMap Project and the 1000 Genomes Project, it is increasingly important for researchers to frame the context, quality and ethical implications of this data for exploring health disparities and human evolution in general. This conference will provide an important forum for linking scientists and scientific information from diverse disciplines and for sparking interdisciplinary research agendas at the frontiers of both human ecological and evolutionary genetics and genetic contributions to health disparities. Conference lectures and discussion panels are topically diverse and include plenary sessions on non-genetic insights into African population genetics (including paleoanthropological, linguistic, biohistorical, geographical, ecological, and demographic), advances in genetic/genomic biotechnology, translation and its application (including epigenetic changes, the genetics of health disparities, linking the genotype and the phenotype, ethics of genetic research, variation in disease susceptibilities, and public health genetics), and a special session on future strategies in African and Transatlantic African Diaspora genetics and genomics. The goal of this last plenary session will be to outline a research agenda for future studies and their application to issues in health disparities both on the continent and in the Americas.  The conference's 18 confirmed speakers include a diverse mix of senior and junior scientists, including many women and members of ethnic minority groups. The overall structure of the conference is well-designed to promote interactions among participants. The increased engagement in the meeting by young scientists will be facilitated by a multi-media, targeted marketing and advertising campaign, as well as by the participation of well-published and respected senior researchers who have committed to attending and actively participating in this international meeting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The roles of genetic/genomic variations in health disparities among African descended peoples remain greatly understudied. This conference will provide a bridge of knowledge that will begin to fill the gaps in our current understanding of the magnitude of genetic diversity in Africa and the Americas, its origins, ecological context, geographical distributions, and biomedical significance. The conference will provide data on African genetic variants, the presence of African genetic retentions in the Americas, as well as evidence for new genetic configurations. Additionally, the conference will explore the more relevant non-genetic factors that have differentially influenced the 21st Century profiles of African genetic and genomic variations and the impact of some of these factors on gene expression, disease susceptibilities and health disparities.            The roles of genetic/genomic variations in health disparities among African descended peoples remain greatly understudied.

"SNMA Annual Medical Education Conference: Physician Researcher Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Student National Medical Association (SNMA) Annual Medical Education Conference (AMEC) has emerged as a cornerstone activity for the organization. Students and professionals gather once a year, with high anticipation, to attend a wide range of educational and networking events. The AMEC attracts students from all levels of medical education and is consistently the largest gathering of under-represented minority medical students at any time in any place in the country. Employing a pivotal theme unique to the given year, the AMEC program incorporates several component tracks, each addressing a different level of educational and professional development. The Physician-Researcher Initiative (PRI) track serves to addresses the lack of minority physician-researchers, who are needed to combat health disparities. The PRI complements and aligns with the strategic objectives of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop the next generation of biomedical and behavioral scientists capable of addressing health disparities. To accomplish this, the PRI track during the AMEC aims to: (1) Promote and highlight the participation of pre-med/med student researchers at the SNMA AMEC, (2) Increase awareness of career options as a Physician Researcher, and (3) Facilitate Physician Researcher networking and mentor-matching opportunities during the conference and beyond. These aims will be achieved by executing specific programmatic objectives such as implementing new incentive programs through Travel Awards and sponsored WCJ Poster Forum prizes named for contributing NIH Institutes and Centers. Novel ways of collaborating with SNMA's existing network of NIH funded institutions to garner support for programming as well as facilitate pipeline mentoring will be explored. Expansion of the PRI comes as the result of increasing interest among the SNMA membership. With continued support by the NIH, we stand to better accomplish PRI's ultimate goal of addressing the need for more minority physicians involved in research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): The paucity of underrepresented minorities conducting biomedical and behavioral research within academia and industry likely contributes to health disparities. By increasing awareness, advertising research opportunities, and providing mentors for SNMA members through the Physician Researcher Initiative, it is anticipated that more underrepresented minorities will be prepared to enter the field and succeed at becoming physician-researchers to help combat the complex diseases that disproportionately affect minority communities.           (provided by applicant): The paucity of underrepresented minorities conducting biomedical and behavioral research within academia and industry likely contributes to health disparities.

"SGIM PCMH Research Conference 2     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abundant research indicates that healthcare delivery systems built around a strong foundation of primary care achieve higher quality of care, superior outcomes, and lower costs. However, due to poor reimbursement and compressed office visits, primary care is viewed as an unattractive career choice by young clinicians, which has led to a shortage of primary care providers in the US. This shortage will only worsen as provisions of the Affordable Care Act that expand access are implemented. In response to these challenges, the patient- centered medical home (PCMH) has emerged as a promising new vehicle for revitalizing primary care and for delivering comprehensive, patient-centered, cost-effective care. Notably, several studies of early adopters of the PCMH model found reductions in hospitalizations, emergency room use, and costs and improvements in quality of care and provider satisfaction These early findings have spawned new initiatives to implement the PCMH model by private insurers, professional societies, integrated healthcare systems, and federal and state healthcare programs, including the Veterans Health Administration, which in 2010 launched the nation's largest PCMH initiative, to date. Because these newer initiatives are targeting a broader spectrum of practices, evidence about the impact of the PCMH model and the barriers to implementation in these settings will be particularly valuable in informing future PCMH implementation. It is in this context that the Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM), Society of Teachers of Family Medicine (STFM), and the Academic Pediatric Association (APA) propose a national invited conference to develop a research agenda to inform further adoption of the PCMH and disseminate preliminary results from ongoing initiatives. These three organizations hosted an initial agenda-setting conference on the PCMH in 2009. However, broader adoption of the PCMH raises new questions and issues regarding the dissemination, implementation, and sustainability of the PCMH model. The conference will convene researchers, representatives of key primary care professional organizations, health care purchasers, payers, patient advocates, and policy makers committed to the PCMH model. The five goals of the conference are to: 1) Review emerging evidence about the impact of the PCMH model on quality, access, and costs of care, including patient and family-centered measures of care. 2) Identify organizational and professional barriers in introducing specific elements of the PCMH model and transforming practices. 3) Examine payment models that have been proposed to support PCMH implementation and the practice investments and resources required for successful PCMH implementation. 4) Identify emerging trends and issues that are likely to impact PCMH implementation. 5) Examine the impact of the PCMH implementation on healthcare disparities. 1        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this grant is to convene a national invited conference to develop a research agenda that will support initiatives to implement the patient centered medical home (PCMH) model in primary care practices caring for adults and children. The conference will bring together a number important stakeholders, including primary care practitioners, researchers, health care purchasers, payers, patient advocates, and policy makers, and will review evidence about the impact of the PCMH model on quality, access, and costs of care, barriers to implementing the PCMH model in different types of practices, possible payment models for the PCMH, and the impact of the PCMH on racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare delivery. The conference will be sponsored by three major organizations - the Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM), Society of Teachers of Family Medicine (STFM), and the Academic Pediatric Association (APA) - that are at the forefront of efforts to improve the delivery of primary care in the US. 1              The goal of this grant is to convene a national invited conference to develop a research agenda that will support initiatives to implement the patient centered medical home (PCMH) model in primary care practices caring for adults and children.

"Health care disparities at the intersection of race, ethnicity, and disability     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Extensive research has documented disparities in access to and quality of health care among racial and ethnic minorities. There are some indications that these disparities are even greater among individuals who also have disabilities. Disability, especially complex disability, is more common in some racial and ethnic minority groups than it is among non-Hispanic Whites. The combination of disability with membership in a minority racial or ethnic group is associated with less access to the social determinants of health (e.g. education, employment, income) than belonging to either group alone. Yet, little work has been done to specifically examine the intersection of race, ethnicity, and disability in relation to health care access and utilization. The proposed conference will address this gap. The purpose of the conference is to share what is currently known and generate an action plan for developing new knowledge to address identified problems and gaps. The rationale for conducting such a conference is that research on racial and ethnic disparities and research on disability- related disparities has thus far been conducted largely independently. A meeting with both groups of researchers is needed to build bridges between these two bodies of research and focus on the overlap of the two populations. Further, there is a need to facilitate translation of research findings into practice. Health care consumers, clinicians, health plans, and policy makers will be included in the conference in order to speed distribution of data that can inform and influence health care practices. These end users will also provide valuable input regarding informational needs, ensuring that future research is relevant and responsive to patient and health system priorities. The conference has three specific aims: 1) Disseminate findings from current projects studying disparities in health care access and utilization among minorities with disabilities; 2) Promote collaboration between racial and ethnic health disparity researchers and disability researchers in addressing health care disparities experienced by minorities with disabilities; and 3) Define issues and challenges in the practice of health care for racial and ethnic minorities with disabilities and develop a research agenda to study and address these issues. The conference will culminate in recommendations for further research into disparities and strategies to increase access to and utilization of health care for people with disabilities in racial and ethnic minority groups. Future implementation of these recommendations, in turn, will contribute to improvements in the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for minorities with physical, sensory, and/or intellectual disabilities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed conference is important to improving health care efficiency and quality by advancing efforts to eliminate disparities in access to care and receipt of recommended preventive care services. It focuses on a particularly high risk population: individuals in racial and ethnic minority groups who also have disabilities. This conference will disseminate current research on disparities in health care access and utilization within this population and develop an action agenda for future health services research regarding improvements in health care delivery.              The proposed conference is important to improving health care efficiency and quality by advancing efforts to eliminate disparities in access to care and receipt of recommended preventive care services.

"Translational Approaches to Reducing Health Disparities in Lung Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Lung diseases cause an estimated 380,000 deaths annually and account for substantial morbidity in Americans. With the recent advances in genomics and DNA sequencing technologies, and targeted personalized medicine; tremendous progress has been made, however, there are numerous health disparities that need to be urgently addressed. For instance, disproportionately higher number of African Americans and Hispanics are likely to be exposed to air pollutants compared to Caucasians that is one of the major factors that contribute to the health disparities seen in asthma and COPD. African Americans are three times more likely to succumb to asthma compared to Caucasians. Despite the lower smoking rates, the incidence, the severity and mortality related to lung cancer are much higher in African Americans. Caucasians followed by Native Americans have the highest death rate due to Cystic Fibrosis (CF) compared to any other race/ethnic back grounds. We, therefore, propose to bring to the forefront the latest developments in translational approaches to various lung diseases, and highlight the existing health disparities with the idea of finding appropriate solutions. The proposed conference will focus on five major thematic areas: 1. Pulmonary Hypertension (including PH associated with sickle cell disease); 2. Airway Diseases (Asthma and COPD); 3. Acute Lung Injury; 4. Interstitial lung diseases (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus); and 5. Lung Cancer. We do realize that there are additional pressing areas in lung diseases, especially infectious diseases such as influenza, pneumonia and TB; however, we plan to address these topics in future conferences. We firmly believe that such focused conferences will foster inter-disciplinary collaborations, give the necessary exposure and encouragement to young scientists, and provide continued medical education. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite several decades of IOM reports detailing the increasing issue of health disparities in vulnerable populations, there has been no significant improvement in this area especially in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases; and health disparities are responsible for the majority of deaths. Both acute and chronic debilitating lung diseases take tremendous toll on productivity and are a major drain on health care resources. This conference will increase awareness about lung health disparities among academic trainees and faculty and serve to facilitate more academic pursuits in this critical area, especially for ou under-represented minority trainees.                Despite several decades of IOM reports detailing the increasing issue of health disparities in vulnerable populations, there has been no significant improvement in this area especially in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases; and health disparities are responsible for the majority of deaths.

"Strategies to Advance the National Research Council's Agenda on Minority Aging Project Summary | Abstract  On behalf of the NIA Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMARs), with leadership by the RCMAR Coordinating Center (CC), we request funding for an annual series of five scientific research conferences. The content of the series will focus on ""Strategies to Advance the National Research Council's Agenda on Minority Aging"". Key themes and agenda topics will be selected for each conference from the research agenda developed by the National Research Council (NRC), ""Understanding Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health in Late Life"" (2004).    This conference series provides a translational opportunity to move the NRC's 18 recommendations into the next steps of research development. The 2008 conference will address minority research project recruitment and retention, a cross cutting issue for all NRC recommendations and a topic that the RCMARs have made important contributions to understanding and improving. In a recent analysis for the NIA, we found that faculty from the RCMAR program had produced 78 journal articles and provided 17 scientific presentations on these topics. The 2009 conference will address measurement and methods issues in minority aging research. From recruitment and methods, we move to the issue of intervention development in 2010. For the 2011 conference we will feature the issue of analytic techniques. The 2012 conference will focus on writing skills development and will address the links between macro (policy) systems and individual factors in minority aging research. Thus the five-year series mirrors the key ingredients in translational research: recruitment, methods, intervention development, analysis, and writing for publication and to inform policy.    Each of the conferences will generate a number of significant outcomes and products, including: research development training for a minimum of 50 faculty/year; skill building products by each attendee; print and web- based resource materials; video streaming programs; one scientific publication submission per year based on the conference. Relevance to Public Health  The reduction of health status disparities is one of the two major goals for Healthy People 2010 (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 2000).

"Recent Advances in AIDS and HIV Research     Description (as provided by the applicant): Since 1998, the NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) have hosted an annual one day National CFAR Scientific Symposium in conjunction with the annual CFAR Directors'/Administrators' meeting. The purpose of the CFAR scientific symposium is to present, in a public forum, recent ""cutting edge"" advances in HIV/AIDS research for an average attendance of approximately 250-300. The intimate size of the meeting promotes opportunities for interactions between young and more senior investigators that would not be available at the larger annual scientific meetings related to HIV/AIDS. The meeting location rotates so that it is hosted each year by a different CFAR site. This provides geographic diversity for the venue and opportunities for a broader array of participants than for similar research symposia. As has been done for the past fifteen years, one of several AIDS-related research areas is the focus of the annual symposium. In 2011, the Duke University CFAR hosted the 15th Annual CFAR Research Symposium with focus on five scientific areas: ""Host-Viral Interactions during HIV Infection"", ""HIV-Associated Malignancies and Co-Infections"", ""Emerging Vaccine Strategies"", ""HIV/AIDS Health Disparities"", and ""Approaches to an HIV Cure"". Speakers were selected from the various NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research leadership, their scientific membership, and from nationally and internationally recognized research institutions. In addition to the participating CFAR Directors and invited leaders in the field, the remaining participants for the annual National CFAR Symposia are chosen based on specific criteria. First preference is given to young investigators who have received developmental funds from an NIH-funded CFAR program; second preference to young investigators with demonstrable potential in HIV/AIDS research; third preference is to other senior investigators engaged in HIV/AIDS research. In all cases women and individuals from underrepresented ethnic groups are encouraged to attend through targeted advertising and travel scholarships. Continuing Medical Education credits have been offered for attendees and access to web casts of the symposia are now available for interested investigators who are not able to attend.         Public Health Relevance: The purpose of the Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Symposium is to provide a venue to present and discuss recent advances in HIV/AIDS research. This is a unique forum for presentations of the most ""cutting edge"" research based on one of several AIDS-related topics.

"People's Scientific Conference to Promote Health and Eliminate Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent health data for Florida show that ethnic/racial minority and underserved populations experience significant health disparities. Efforts that promote community engagement and empowerment also reduce health disparities. The principles of community engaged research (CEnR) require that researchers and community members learn from each other through bi-directional communication. Building on a two-year collaboration with culturally diverse CEnR researchers across Florida, the 2011 Florida Health Disparities Research (FHDR) Agenda includes a call for such communication and for dissemination of evidence-based interventions that foster individual and community health promotion, and training that will inspire and prepare the next generation of CEnR scientists, particularly those who are minorities.  The FHDR Agenda was the impetus for The People's Scientific Conference to Promote Health and Eliminate Health Disparities. The broad, long-term objectives of this conference are to (a) promote culturally and linguistically sensitive biomedical research and CEnR that will lead to significantly improved health and elimination of health disparities in Florida and (b) begin a dialogue that will lead to an increase in the number of racial/ethnic minority researchers engaging in these types of research. The overall aim of this conference is to provide opportunities for bi-directional communication between researchers and the lay community regarding evidence-based interventions/strategies for promoting health and eliminating health disparities in Florida. Specifically, this conference will: 1) Provide opportunities for culturally diverse veteran, new, and future researchers and community health workers to present evidence-based interventions and research that have implications for promoting health and eliminating health disparities; 2) Identify (a) the motivators of and barriers to participating in health studies, engaging in health promoting behaviors, adhering to treatment recommendations, and using available health care resources, and (b) provider and researcher behaviors that foster trust and decrease anxiety among minority patients and research participants, respectively; 3) Provide opportunities for culturally diverse health researchers, health promoters, health care providers, community health workers, and community members to learn from and teach each other about mental and physical health disparities in Florida and the nation; and 4) Provide resources for 20 pre-/post-docs, junior investigators, and community health workers (15 from Florida and 5 from other states) to participate in a Health Disparities Research Fellow Mentoring Program that will be launched as part of the conference.  Outcomes include: a Mentoring Program for students, junior investigators, and community health workers, a conference proceedings that includes a model for promoting health and eliminating health disparities in racial/ethnic minority and underserved communities, and video testimonials of researchers indicating how conference participation impacted the way in which they conduct their research.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The health disparities data for Florida show that racial/ethnic minority and underserved communities experience significant health disparities. The People's Scientific Conference to Promote Health and Eliminate Health Disparities is a first-of-its-kind conference in which members of these communities, and diverse researchers and health care providers come together to learn from and teach each other information that will foster research-informed interventions to promote health and eliminate health disparities.

"Population Center Faculty Meetings Project Summary/Abstract  Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people experience systemic health disparities. A remaining obstacle to growth of our understanding of LGBT health and ability to take steps to address LGBT health disparities is the lack of opportunities for interdisciplinary scientists to meet and exchange ideas about the key issues and methodological challenges in understanding sexual and gender minorities (SGM). The proposed annual Scientific Meeting in LGBT Population Health Research sponsored by The Center for Population Research in LGBT Health (the Center) at The Fenway Institute of Fenway Health will fill this gap. To be held annually in the summer at Fenway Health's Conference Center in Boston, Massachusetts, the Scientific Meeting will draw together a diverse national group of experts and promising new scientists to advance the state of the science in the study of SGM population health.    Each meeting will share the core objectives to 1) exchange information about the most recent developments in SGM population health; 2) coordinate cooperative research endeavors in SGM health through Working Groups sponsored by the Center; and 3) explore and seek solutions to methodological challenges in studying and estimating SGM population groups. In response to ongoing advances in the field, an Organizing Committee will annually select focused and timely topics to be addressed at each meeting by the invited speakers and key meeting participants. Areas of focus for the 2010 meeting include the health of SGM racial minority groups, chronic conditions and disabilities in older sexual and gender minorities, and child development in families parented by lesbians and gay men. The format of the proposed 2010 meeting includes scientific presentations by invited speakers, presentations of work in progress from faculty leaders of the Center, discussions of methodological problems and solutions, and working group breakout sessions. Meeting participants will include the faculty of the Center, graduate student mentees enrolled in the Center's Mentoring and Training Program, community research partners and other research collaborators. Keynote scientific presentations will be open to the public and advertised to the LGBT community. The format for subsequent meetings is expected to be similar to the proposed 2010 meeting, but will be adjusted by the Organizing Committee in response to evaluation feedback from the previous year. Project Narrative  Relevance: The proposed Scientific Meeting will contribute to an understanding of the behavioral and social science aspects of human development.

"African-Caribbean Cancer Consortium Scientific and Training Conference     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The African-Caribbean Cancer Consortium (AC3) was conceived in 2006 for the study of viral, genetic and environmental risk factors in populations of African descent. The establishment of this Consortium has provided new collaborative opportunities for cancer research among investigators throughout the various islands in the Caribbean, United States and Africa. Since the establishment of the AC3, 71 investigators have joined and are conducting collaborative studies of cancer risk in the US, Caribbean islands and Africa. Cervical and prostate cancer studies are ongoing in Brooklyn, USA, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana as well as Nigeria. Head and neck cancer studies are ongoing in the US (Pittsburgh and Brooklyn). Breast cancer studies are ongoing in Brooklyn, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Guyana. The studied populations include African-Americans, African-Caribbean, African as well as immigrant African-descent populations living in the United States. We seek funding to support our next conference entitled: ""Continuing to Build Capacity to Address Health Disparities in Populations of African Ancestry: a Focus on Women's Cancers."" The purpose of this conference is to provide the forum/infrastructure through which AC3 participating investigators and non-members will be able to 1) present cancer research data and progress reports of newly funded studies or evaluate new research ideas for studies that focus on gene- environment interactions and cancer disparities in populations of African descent; 2) describe the health resources, screening and other preventive activities present or absent that may attribute to higher cancer incidence and mortality in their study populations; 3) to formally discuss the coordination of current and future research collaborations; 4) provide a forum for training junior investigators and students who are interested in pursuing careers in health disparities research 5) raise the awareness throughout the local Philadelphia community about the importance of minority participation research and clinical trials; and 6) to seek funding from the NIMHD and NCI to support case-control studies of cancer risk across these at-risk populations. This upcoming meeting will focus our attention to address a significant need for studies related to cancer in women of African descent and will promote studies that will fill in the gaps in the existing knowledge about cancer risk and outcomes related to women's cancers in African-descent populations. The conference will also provide a forum for training and career development that will lead to an increase in diversity among young cancer research investigators. The uniqueness of this conference is that it serves not only as a forum for training, research presentation and interaction, but also promotes the development and coordination of research studies that involve African-American, African-Caribbean and African populations as a whole.              RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH African-Americans have significantly higher cancer incidence and mortality rates compared to other ethnic groups in the US 28 and cervical, breast and uterine cancers are among the top 5 leading causes of death in the Caribbean Islands 29.

"Transforming Women's Health: Discovery, Development, and Delivery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women's health is influenced by biological, behavioral, cultural, socio-economic and environmental factors. Moreover, several oral-systemic linkages associated with poor oral health (i.e. periodontitis; oral bone loss; dental caries) that solely or disproportionally affect women include various infectious (HIV/AIDS), chronic (cardiovascular disease), behavioral (eating disorders), psychosocial (stress) and socio-economic health conditions (poverty). Although the importance of expanding women's oral-systemic research has been highlighted by Healthy People 2020 and The Office of Research on Women's Health, little collaboration between and among disciplines occur. Specifically in Florida, women's oral-health disparities are evident: pregnant women have higher adverse rates in health outcomes (i.e. infant mortality, low birth weight, preterm birth) and are less likely to isit a dentist compared to women in the U.S. Thus, we propose a unique, focused, regionally-based (State of Florida) conference, ""Transforming Women's Health: Discovery, Development and Delivery,"" which aims to address complex oral-systemic health issues specific to women and bring together researchers, providers and policy experts in public health, medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy and the social sciences. This paradigm shift has been institutionalized at the University of South Florida (USF) by the creation of the Center for Transdisciplinary Research on Women's Health (CTR-WH), Co-Directed by the PI. Through a transdisciplinary approach, the proposed conference will facilitate patient-centered collaborative care that has the potential to improve health care access, quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed conference will focus on the emerging evidence and gaps related to oral-systemic research (research development), highlight the need for a transdisciplinary approach and team science to decrease morbidity and mortality (research design and methodology), and disseminate novel findings and technologies to improve health care access, quality and outcomes (dissemination and implementation). Moreover, health services research (e.g., health IT, prevention and care management; health care innovations and emerging areas) will be discussed, including opportunities for communication and application of technology to improve prevention, early detection and treatment of oral-systemic health conditions. Based on adult learning and team science, participants will be engaged in skill-based workshops, question-and-answer sessions with nationally renowned speakers, panel discussion and group roundtables in order to meet conference aims. Conference sessions will be evaluated via qualitative and quantitative methods to determine the extent to which learning objective are met, the effectiveness of teaching/learning methods, the usefulness of conference material, and participant satisfaction. Conference proceedings will be disseminated through posting on the CTR-WH website, peer-reviewed scientific journal manuscripts, brief articles in public health media sources, and at regional, state, and national conferences to ensure findings reach stakeholders in Florida and beyond.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed conference aims to transform women's health by bringing together researchers, practitioners, policymakers and other key stakeholders from multiple disciplines such as public health, medicine and dentistry. Through nationally renowned speakers, workshops, panel discussions and group roundtables, this conference will address complex women's oral-systemic health conditions through a transdisciplinary approach.

"SNMA Annual Medical Education Conference: Physician Researcher Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Student National Medical Association (SNMA) Annual Medical Education Conference (AMEC) has emerged as a cornerstone activity for the organization. Students and professionals gather once a year, with high anticipation, to attend a wide range of educational and networking events. The AMEC attracts students from all levels of medical education and is consistently the largest gathering of under-represented minority medical students at any time in any place in the country. Employing a pivotal theme unique to the given year, the AMEC program incorporates several component tracks, each addressing a different level of educational and professional development. The Physician-Researcher Initiative (PRI) track serves to addresses the lack of minority physician-researchers, who are needed to combat health disparities. The PRI complements and aligns with the strategic objectives of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop the next generation of biomedical and behavioral scientists capable of addressing health disparities. To accomplish this, the PRI track during the AMEC aims to: (1) Promote and highlight the participation of pre-med/med student researchers at the SNMA AMEC, (2) Increase awareness of career options as a Physician Researcher, and (3) Facilitate Physician Researcher networking and mentor-matching opportunities during the conference and beyond. These aims will be achieved by executing specific programmatic objectives such as implementing new incentive programs through Travel Awards and sponsored WCJ Poster Forum prizes named for contributing NIH Institutes and Centers. Novel ways of collaborating with SNMA's existing network of NIH funded institutions to garner support for programming as well as facilitate pipeline mentoring will be explored. Expansion of the PRI comes as the result of increasing interest among the SNMA membership. With continued support by the NIH, we stand to better accomplish PRI's ultimate goal of addressing the need for more minority physicians involved in research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): The paucity of underrepresented minorities conducting biomedical and behavioral research within academia and industry likely contributes to health disparities. By increasing awareness, advertising research opportunities, and providing mentors for SNMA members through the Physician Researcher Initiative, it is anticipated that more underrepresented minorities will be prepared to enter the field and succeed at becoming physician-researchers to help combat the complex diseases that disproportionately affect minority communities.

"A National Community Partner Forum on Community-Engaged Research as a Tool for El     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Collaboration with communities in research occurs along a continuum referred to as community-engaged research. Community-engaged research is recognized by NIH, researchers and community groups as critical to understanding and addressing differences in health status and health outcomes across race, ethnicity and income status. As a result, community groups are increasingly being approached by researchers seeking to conduct research in the communities they serve or have access to, and more community groups are initiating their own research studies. Universities and university-based health disparities researchers have established funding mechanisms for their research roles and networks for professional development, mentoring and advocacy. As more community organizations are engaged in research, it is clear that they need their own such supports. Building on a successful conference held in December 2011 that laid the foundation for a national community partner network, our proposed conference, ""A National Community Partner Forum on Community-Engaged Research as a Tool for Eliminating Health Disparities: From Dialogue to Action"" will convene community organizations involved in health disparities research to deepen their knowledge and skills, present their work and get feedback from peers, dialogue with key stakeholders, and grow and strengthen a national community partner network.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Community-engaged research is recognized by NIH, researchers and community groups as critical to achieving health equity across the diverse communities that comprise the United States. By convening community organizations that are involved in community-engaged health disparities research, our proposed conference will help to ensure that communities most affected by health disparities are at the decision making tables that decide what research gets conducted, how and by whom, and that adequate resources are provided for their involvement. As such, the proposed conference seeks to ensure that community-engaged health disparities research in the future can reach its full potential to improve the public's health.                  Community-engaged research is recognized by NIH, researchers and community groups as critical to achieving health equity across the diverse communities that comprise the United States.

"Building Partnerships to Enhance Health and Health Care Delivery in Alabama and G     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuskegee University's National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care (TUNCBRHC) seeks to forge and sustain a collaborative partnership between State and Local Public Health Departments in Alabama and Georgia, and underserved Black Belt communities in both states. This will be done by establishing regular and substantive communication between the Health Departments and Black Belt civil society, social and faith-based networks, as well as research faculty from Historically Black Colleges and Universities.     The proposed conference is intended to be the first of a series of annual conferences, convened under the rubric of Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR), which is a ""collaborative approach to research that equitably involves all partners in the research process and recognizes the unique strengths that each brings"". By providing a space for information dissemination and informed discourse between equal partners, TUNCBRHC believes these conferences will:     *	Create a process for collaboratively deciding on priorities for public health intervention  for the following year, and a forum for assessing interventions from the prior year.     *	Identify issues that can be explored at the annual health policy forums TUNCBRHC hosts in conjunction with the Commemoration Celebration.     *	Publish conference Proceedings for national consumption.     African-Americans are subject to health disparities, for example, a higher incidence of cancer and higher cancer mortality rates than the Caucasian population (Darr, 2005). Cardiovascular diseases and stroke, chemical dependency, diabetes, homicide and accidents, HIV/AIDS and infant mortality added to cancer account for more than 80 percent of the excess mortality observed among Blacks and other minority groups when compared to non- Hispanic Whites.     Because they have a higher demographic concentration of African-Americans, the effects of these disparities are concentrated in the Black Belt counties. These counties face challenges to the availability, accessibility and acceptability of health industry services.     Attempts to resolve these issues must involve the input and ultimately the participation of the communities most affected. This conference is intended to be the first of many to provide a platform for community involvement.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African-Americans are subject to health disparities, and health-care access difficulties, which have disproportionate effects on Black Belt counties compared to other counties nationally. Resolving these issues cannot involve only federal, state and local Health Departments, but must also include civil society organizations, social and faith-based networks and research from HBCUs. This conference is intended to be the first of a series that will serve as the foundation for a partnership between State and Local Health Departments and underserved communities in the Alabama and Georgia Black Belt.                  African-Americans are subject to health disparities, and health-care access difficulties, which have disproportionate effects on Black Belt counties compared to other counties nationally.

"7th Annual Texas Conference on Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of North Texas Health Science Center established the Texas Center for Health Disparities to conduct education, research and outreach activities to eliminate health disparities. As part of its education and outreach activitis, the Center has been has organized very successful annual health disparity conferences for the past five years supported and funded in part by the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD) focusing on different areas of health disparities. The Seventh Annual Conference on Health Disparities will be held July 12th and 13th, 2012 at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. The overall theme for the conference is ""Battling Breast Cancer Disparities: Frontline Strategies!"". Striking health disparities exist in the area of breast cancer. Occurrence of breast cancer is disproportionate in premenopausal and AA women. AA women develop highly aggressive tumors and have higher mortality rate than other groups. Premenopausal AA women are not only at a higher risk of breast cancer (33%) compared to Caucasian women (25%), but also are at a high risk of developing TNBC. This conference will feature nationally recognized speakers, patients, survivors and community speakers, and interactive debates highlighting the striking disparities and frontline strategies to overcome thes disparities in breast cancer. Of specific focus will be Prevention Strategies in Medicine and Community with emphasis on Community Based solutions. Educational and interactive presentations, panel discussions and questions/ answer sessions will identify the challenges and bring conference attendees closer to developing a prospectus for the future. The Specific Aims of this application are: 1) Enhance health disparity knowledge of the health care practitioners and policy makers, and 2) Serve as a resource for the minority communities to disseminate health information, promote community participation in health education and research, and to implement disease prevention activities. The expected outcome will be increased participation of health care practitioners in minority communities and awareness of policy makers in the existing health disparities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities are a significant challenge to the health and well being of Americans.

"PRIDE COORDINATION CENTER    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary:  This application seeks to address the organizational and support needs of several training programs that are engaged in efforts to increase diversity among scientists doing biomedical research (called PRIDE). The PRIDE programs conduct mentored Summer Institutes that are designed to enhance the career development of minority junior faculty and scientists by further developing their research skills and knowledge. This project will serve as the coordination core (CC) to support these training programs. The CC will facilitate the education and evaluation activities among programs by designing and overseeing a web-based infrastructure does the following. (1) Recruitment and outreach: The CC will use web-based informatics methods to develop and coordinate outreach efforts to recruit trainees to the Summer Institute programs. (2) Mentoring and Networking: The CC will coordinate efforts to identify mentors for the trainees (mentoring teams), to develop and conduct training workshops for the mentoring teams, to evaluate the effectiveness of the mentoring teams, and to identify and disseminate information on additional training and networking opportunities for the trainees. (3) Meetings: The CC will handle all plans and logistics for the CC to site-visit each program and for at least two annual meetings to be held in the Washington DC area. One annual meeting will be attended by the PIs and NHLBI staff (directors meeting) and another by all the NHLBI and program staff, faculty, mentees and mentors (Annual PRIDE Conference). (4) Communications: The CC will handle all communications including coordinating conference calls, recording and distributing minutes of calls and meetings, and creating web- based resources for program-wide needs such as posting directories, NIH policies and procedures, recruiting and application materials, newsletters, funding opportunities, and announcements. (5) Evaluations and Tracking: The CC will facilitate the development of a web-based evaluations and tracking protocol for the entire consortium, including a proposal to track mentees from a previous NHLBI-supported study (SIPID). Finally, the CC will facilitate the production of analyses and reports documenting the progress of the PRIDE efforts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is well known that CVD disproportionately affects minorities, and yet recruiting minorities into these research studies has been difficult.

"Achieving Healthy Weights in African American Communities - AACORN Workshop     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests support for a scientific workshop focusing on achieving healthy  weights in African American communities under PA-10-071. The proposed two-day scientific  workshop would engage 80-100 academic researchers and community research partners to  achieve the following objectives: 1) assess current knowledge of effective weight control  interventions relevant to black communities, examining current evidence across the life course  and from multiple disciplinary perspectives~ and 2) develop synthesis recommendations for  research, practice, and policy. Participants will include academic scholars and scholars-in- training from public health, nutrition and food studies, exercise science, public policy, community  development, marketing, economics, and other fields, as well as community research partners.   The rationale for the conference relates to the lack of evidence on effective interventions in  African American communities in the face of much higher than average obesity- related risks.  However, studies published during the last 10 years, combined with the recent surge in  community-based programming in this area, can support a fruitful dialogue and help to refine  the focus of future initiatives.  This focus directy addresses NIH strategic goals for elimination of  racial/ethnic disparities in obesity and cardiovascular diseases.  Given the urgency of controlling  the obesity epidemic, a timely workshop that will engage researchers, community research  partners, and others to extract and synthesize insights from current research and practice is  warranted. The 2012 workshop will be the 5th in a successful series of biennial conferences  convened under the auspices of the African American Collaborative Obesity Research Network  (AACORN), a national research network that is based at the University of Pennsylvania.  AACORN links scholars, researchers and community-based research partners nationally in  efforts to increase the quality, quantity, and effective translation of research to address weight  issues in African American communities.  Workshop outcomes will be disseminated through the  internet, academic journals, and other channels.                         Project Narrative     Obesity prevalence and related risks are higher in African Americans compared to whites, but  evidence on effective interventions to address obesity in African American children and adults  continues to be lacking. Studies published during the last 10 years, combined with the recent  surge in community-based programming in this area, can support a fruitful dialogue to examine  which of the tested approaches are promising, what novel approaches are emerging, and what  is needed to inform the next phase of research, practice, and policy. This two-day scientific  workshop will engage a diverse group of scholars and community partners to deliberate on  these issues from a transdisciplinary perspective.

"International Conference on Health in the African Diaspora (ICHAD)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to PA-10-071 - NIH Support for Conference and Scientific Meetings (Parent R13/U13). We are seeking grant funding under the R13 mechanism to convene a conference titled ""International Conference on Health in the African Diaspora of the Americas (ICHAD)."" The ICHAD conference will be held July 4-8, 2012 in Baltimore, MD. The goal of the conference is to provide an international platform for scholars to exchange knowledge about solutions to major health challenges, including health disparities, facing black populations in the Western Hemisphere. We have received grant support from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, which covers most of the conference costs. We are now seeking support from NIMHD to cover language translation services to facilitate access to Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking attendees. Between the 1600s and the 1800s, the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade gave rise to a large African Diaspora throughout the Americas and the Caribbean. Today there are approximately 60 million African descendants living in the Western Hemisphere. They share a common history of forced migration and subjugation, but the different cultural and historical contexts of the countries in which they have settled have forged divergent social and cultural experiences. There is only limited understanding of what these commonalities and differences have produced in terms of health and social status. Some countries - such as the United States, Canada and Brazil - have produced a significant volume of research documenting striking race disparities. However, in other counties - such as Honduras and Colombia - research on race disparities is in the early stages. With support from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, staff of the NIMHD-funded Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions (HCHDS) has been working to identify researchers throughout the Western Hemisphere who are conducting research on health disparities among African descent populations. We now propose to convene these colleagues to share research findings and solutions to health disparities among African descent populations of the Americans. The proposed conference will support the following aims: 1. To explore and describe the health status of the African descent populations of the Western  Hemisphere; 2. To identify differences and commonalities in how ""race"" is conceptualized throughout the  region and describe how the different conceptualizations of ""race"" influence how we  understand health and health disparities in black populations; 3. To identify differences and commonalities in the social and historical experiences of black  populations in the region and describe how these differences contribute to variations in  health status and health care among black subgroups; 4. To describe the phenomenon of racial disparities in health in the Western Hemisphere and  identify possible causes for these disparities and potential areas for intervention; 5. To identify areas of promising research and intervention which can inform future research on  health disparities in the U.S. and elsewhere; and 6. To establish an ongoing, multidisciplinary network of scholars to undertake future  investigations of black health status in the region.                 We are seeking support to establish an international network of scholars, health workers and community activists to advance the health of the African Diaspora. The network will facilitate the transnational sharing of solutions to addressing the common health problems of the African descent population. We will do this by (1) coordinating a biannual conference, (2) publishing a book which outlines the health status and solutions of health inequities and (3) maintain a website to facilitate ongoing communication between biannual conferences. The first conference will be held in October 2011 in Baltimore, Maryland. Subsequent conferences will be held in other regions of the world.

"Research Colloquium for Junior Investigators     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal seeks support for a Research Colloquium for Junior Investigators held during the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). This annual event has taken place in each of the past 17 years under the sponsorship of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) in 2012 with administrative direction from the American Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education (APIRE). Primary specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) identify current and future senior psychiatric residents research fellows and junior faculty psychiatrists (with special emphasis on ethnic/racial minorities and women) who are promising candidates for successful research careers; (2) provide a one-day intensive, mentored, training session that will allow these participants to present their current or proposed research protocols in small group sessions and; (3) to receive faculty mentoring and peer feedback. Additional specific aims are to: (1) encourage Colloquium participants to maintain a research career path and; (2) provide information and resources that will enable them to obtain outside funding and launch successful research careers, as measured by the receipt of grant support, publication in peer-reviewed journals, and academic appointments at research institutions. The Colloquium is designed around a one-day workshop that is held annually on the Sunday that ends the meeting of the Society for Biological Psychiatry and begins the APA annual meeting. A total of 30 junior investigators will be selected to participate and will meet in small groups of three to five trainees and two faculty, where the trainees will provide a 15-20 minute presentation of their current or proposed study. Participants will also be required to present a poster during a noon poster session where they will receive additional faculty mentoring. NIMH currently is able to provide support for the Colloquium every other year. This submission seeks support to maintain the Colloquium on an annual basis. The current proposal further extends this well-established and highly regarded program by expanding the emphasis on minority researchers, focusing specific content on disparities in health care research, and providing opportunities throughout the year for participants to have ""booster sessions"" through access to an interactive research training website. This website has been developed with support from a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contract on which APIRE has served as sub-contractor. The website provides lectures, power-point presentations, case- studies, self-assessment questions, and opportunities for threaded discussions on an array of research content, including statistical consultation, writing research proposals, critically appraising the research literature, and research ethics. To expand the Colloquium's focus on young minority psychiatric researchers, APA has sponsored a panel discussion, ""Developing and Sustaining Research Careers: Psychiatrists from Underrepresented Groups Share their Experiences"". This discussion among four minority psychiatrists, moderated by Annelle Primm, M.D., M.P.H., APA's Director of Minority and National Affairs, focuses on the challenges and obstacles faced by these researchers as well as the influences that supported their careers. The hour-long panel discussion, as well as a six minute overview, is available on DVD. This submission also includes responses from a survey of former Colloquium participants, highlighting their academic and research achievements.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Research Colloquium for Junior Investigators is a one day conference that is held during the APA annual meeting for psychiatry residents, research fellows, and junior faculty that are starting research careers to meet with senior research mentors to receive advice on their planned research studies.

"8th Annual Texas Conference on Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of North Texas Health Science Center established the Texas Center for Health Disparities to conduct education, research and outreach activities to eliminate health disparities. As part of its education and outreach activitis, the Center has been has organized very successful annual health disparity conferences for the past seven years supported and funded in part by the National Institutes for Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) focusing on different areas of health disparities. The Eighth Annual Conference on Health Disparities will be held May 30-31, 2013 at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. The overall theme for the conference is ""Disparities related to Smoking, HIV/AIDS and Cancer"". Tobacco smoking, HIV/AIDS and cancer are all known to disproportionally affect various under- represented minority populations. While these three disparities have been the topic of research and conferences, the interplay among all these three health disparity issues has not been a focus of any previous conference. We chose the theme based on input and feedback from our Community Advisory Board in order to meet the needs of our community. Of specific focus will be Prevention Strategies in Medicine and Community with emphasis on Community Based solutions. Educational and interactive presentations, panel discussions and questions/ answer sessions will identify the challenges and bring conference attendees closer to developing a prospectus for the future. The Specific Aims of this application are: 1) Enhance health disparity knowledge of the health care practitioners and policy makers, and 2) Serve as a resource for the minority communities to disseminate health information, promote community participation in health education and research, and to implement disease prevention activities. The expected outcome will be increased participation of health care practitioners in minority communities and awareness of policy makers in the existing health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Health disparities are a significant challenge to the health and wellbeing of Americans. Elimination of health disparities necessitates a full understanding of the existence of health disparities as well as best practices and novel solutions to the problem.

"Recent Advances in AIDS and HIV Research Description (as provided by the applicant): Since 1998, the NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) have hosted an annual one day National CFAR Scientific Symposium in conjunction with the annual CFAR Directors'/Administrators' meeting. The purpose of the CFAR scientific symposium is to present, in a public forum, recent ""cutting edge"" advances in HIV/AIDS research for an average attendance of approximately 250-300. The intimate size of the meeting promotes opportunities for interactions between young and more senior investigators that would not be available at the larger annual scientific meetings related to HIV/AIDS. The meeting location rotates so that it is hosted each year by a different CFAR site. This provides geographic diversity for the venue and opportunities for a broader array of participants than for similar research symposia. As has been done for the past fifteen years, one of several AIDS-related research areas is the focus of the annual symposium. In 2011, the Duke University CFAR hosted the 15th Annual CFAR Research Symposium with focus on five scientific areas: ""Host-Viral Interactions during HIV Infection"", ""HIV-Associated Malignancies and Co-Infections"", ""Emerging Vaccine Strategies"", ""HIV/AIDS Health Disparities"", and ""Approaches to an HIV Cure"". Speakers were selected from the various NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research leadership, their scientific membership, and from nationally and internationally recognized research institutions. In addition to the participating CFAR Directors and invited leaders in the field, the remaining participants for the annual National CFAR Symposia are chosen based on specific criteria. First preference is given to young investigators who have received developmental funds from an NIH-funded CFAR program; second preference to young investigators with demonstrable potential in HIV/AIDS research; third preference is to other senior investigators engaged in HIV/AIDS research. In all cases women and individuals from underrepresented ethnic groups are encouraged to attend through targeted advertising and travel scholarships. Continuing Medical Education credits have been offered for attendees and access to web casts of the symposia are now available for interested investigators who are not able to attend. The purpose of the Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Symposium is to provide a venue to present and discuss recent advances in HIV/AIDS research. This is a unique forum for presentations of the most ""cutting edge"" research based on one of several AIDS-related topics. The symposium provides an environment that fosters interactions between senior HIV investigators and junior investigators that will one day be leaders in the field.",Recent Advances in AIDS and HIV Research,8705971,R13AI102630,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Advertising ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' continuing medical education ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Scholarship ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccines ', ' Woman ', ' Administrator ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' working group ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R13,2013,15000,0.0491978041714797
"Latino Health Research, Practice and Policy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The number of Latinos in the five-state WWAMI region (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho) has increased significantly over the last three decades such that Latinos are now the largest and fastest growing minority group in the region. In 2011, there were more than one million Latinos living in the WWAMI region. Unfortunately, there is a lack of research addressing the most important health problems facing this population. To address this gap, the Community Outreach Research Translation (CORT) core of the Institute for Translational Health Sciences (ITHS) at the University of Washington is proposing a two day conference titled, ""Latino Health Research, Practice and Policy: Identifying our Strengths and Growing our Collaborations."" The overall goal of this conference is fostering new community-engaged research along three broad themes: behavioral health, chronic illness treatment and prevention, and health policy. The specific aims of the conference are: Aim 1: To provide a forum for the exchange of knowledge, professional networking for the purpose of developing new community-engaged research collaborations focused on the health of Hispanic communities in the WWAMI region. To address this aim, the conference will include: (1) Keynote presentations by regional leaders of community-based organizations, leading Hispanic health scholars, and government policy makers; and (2) Small group discussion sessions among community-based organization leaders, academic investigators, health care providers, and government policy makers. Aim 2: To publish conference proceedings that identify specific opportunities for research collaborations grounded in the views of conference participants in three thematic areas: behavioral health, chronic illness prevention and treatment, and health policy - all focused on Latino communities in the WWAMI region. Aim 3: To create a website for the dissemination of the conference proceedings and to foster ongoing communication among conference participants. The website will provide an archive including videos of keynote presentations, speakers' slides, conference evaluations, and a wiki that allows user to read and post comments and questions. The conference organizing committee consists of a diverse group of individuals from leading research institutions, academia, Latino-serving community-based organizations, and policy makers from the WWAMI region. Invited conference participants will include Latino community members, academic investigators interested in engaging with Latino communities, and health policy makers from throughout the WWAMI region. The proposed conference will be held at the University of Washington's South Lake Union Facilities located in Seattle, WA in early 2014.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The number of Latinos in the five-state WWAMI region (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho) has increased significantly over the last three decades such that Latinos are now the largest and fastest growing minority group in the region. Unfortunately, there is a lack of research addressing the health problems facing this population. To address this gap, the Community Outreach Research Translation (CORT) core of the Institute for Translational Health Sciences (ITHS) is proposing to hold a 2-day conference with the overall goal of fostering new community-engaged research along three themes: behavioral health, chronic illness treatment and prevention, and health policy. Conference participants will include Latino community members, academic investigators, and government policy makers from the WWAMI region.                ","Latino Health Research, Practice and Policy",8651296,R13MD008667,"['Accounting ', ' Alaska ', ' Archives ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Idaho ', ' Information Networks ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Montana ', ' Population Growth ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Wyoming ', ' County ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Letters ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Slide ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Outreach Research ', ' trend ', ' Community Health ', ' minority health ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' translational health science ', ' wiki ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMHD,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R13,2013,49860,0.04242721559020025

"SNMA Annual Medical Education Conference: Physician Researcher Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Student National Medical Association (SNMA) Annual Medical Education Conference (AMEC) has emerged as a cornerstone activity for the organization. Students and professionals gather once a year, with high anticipation, to attend a wide range of educational and networking events. The AMEC attracts students from all levels of medical education and is consistently the largest gathering of under-represented minority medical students at any time in any place in the country. Employing a pivotal theme unique to the given year, the AMEC program incorporates several component tracks, each addressing a different level of educational and professional development. The Physician-Researcher Initiative (PRI) track serves to addresses the lack of minority physician-researchers, who are needed to combat health disparities. The PRI complements and aligns with the strategic objectives of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop the next generation of biomedical and behavioral scientists capable of addressing health disparities. To accomplish this, the PRI track during the AMEC aims to: (1) Promote and highlight the participation of pre-med/med student researchers at the SNMA AMEC, (2) Increase awareness of career options as a Physician Researcher, and (3) Facilitate Physician Researcher networking and mentor-matching opportunities during the conference and beyond. These aims will be achieved by executing specific programmatic objectives such as implementing new incentive programs through Travel Awards and sponsored WCJ Poster Forum prizes named for contributing NIH Institutes and Centers. Novel ways of collaborating with SNMA's existing network of NIH funded institutions to garner support for programming as well as facilitate pipeline mentoring will be explored. Expansion of the PRI comes as the result of increasing interest among the SNMA membership. With continued support by the NIH, we stand to better accomplish PRI's ultimate goal of addressing the need for more minority physicians involved in research.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): The paucity of underrepresented minorities conducting biomedical and behavioral research within academia and industry likely contributes to health disparities. By increasing awareness, advertising research opportunities, and providing mentors for SNMA members through the Physician Researcher Initiative, it is anticipated that more underrepresented minorities will be prepared to enter the field and succeed at becoming physician-researchers to help combat the complex diseases that disproportionately affect minority communities.

"Time for ACTion: Comprehensive Recommendations for Antenatal Corticosteroid Treat  Project Summary/Abstract The public charity Day Before Birth--with the support of 12 national experts, the March of Dimes, ACOG and other partners--is organizing the proposed conference to improve the health and life course of premature infants by stimulating new research, practice and policy to increase appropriate utilization of antenatal corticosteroid treatment (ACT) and by developing comprehensive recommendations for the next decade. In the US, preterm birth is the leading cause of newborn death; it is a major determinant of all infant mortality/morbidity; and it is responsible for complications that impact the health of children and their families throughout their lives. Rates of preterm birth (12.0% in 2010) continue to be well above the Healthy People 2020 objective of 11.4% -a rate that may be achievable but is still too high. For decades, the NIH, the Joint Commission, ACOG and many other leading institutions have recommended ACT treatment-offered ideally 48 hours before delivery--as one of the most effective treatments to improve the survival and health of infants born prematurely between 24 and 34 weeks gestation. Top institutions generally comply with treatment guidelines, but treatment rates are very uneven, below 25% in many communities. Out of the 170,000 women who deliver early (24-34 weeks) annually in the US, more than half deliver within 48 hours of hospital admission and therefore fail to get optimal treatment. Existing quality improvement practices, if applied, could make a difference-the prime motivation of this conference. If all eligible for ACT were fully treated, it is estimated that more than 1,000 newborn lives might be saved, a 5% reduction in neonatal mortality rates. On January 13-14 of 2014 in Washington, D.C., the conference will convene a multidisciplinary group of 50 leading experts from academia, government and the private sector; and in particular, the event will endeavor to broaden the ACT movement within the public health community and to involve women more consciously and programmatically, utilizing patient-centered care models. The conference will foster recent advances in translational research to help assure evidence-based guidelines and successful ACT quality improvement programs are implemented locally and nationally. The conference focuses on seven of the most promising areas: 1) highlight the successes and challenges of hospital and State ACT quality improvement programs; 2) understand ACT implementation barriers prior to hospital care; 3) address racial/ethnic ACT disparities; 4) formulate patient educational and advocacy campaigns; 5) improve ACT data collection; 6) promote ACT pharmaceutical research; and 7) disseminate/translate successful ACT quality improvement programs nationally. For each topic, the speaker will end the presentation with recommendations on ways the Nation might add to the current knowledge base, social strategy and political will that would significantly advance ACT treatment over the next decade. The conference will enhance the attendee's capacity to re-engineer healthcare systems, engage consumers and accelerate innovation to assure ACT treatment is consistently administered across all geographic regions, in all levels of hospitals and for all racial, ethnic and socio-economic groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our proposed national conference ""Time for ACTion"" examines opportunities to re-engineer healthcare systems, engage consumers and accelerate innovation to assure appropriate use of antenatal corticosteroid treatment (ACT)--one of the most effective, evidence-based interventions to reduce the devastating consequences and increase the survival rate of premature birth. The conference will benefit attendees, first, by advancing research, programs and policy that have potential for significantly improving ACT utilization over the next decade, and second, by developing comprehensive recommendations to assure that ACT treatment is consistently administered across all geographic regions, in all levels of hospitals and for all racial, ethnic and socio-economic groups.            ",Time for ACTion: Comprehensive Recommendations for Antenatal Corticosteroid Treat,8534514,R13HS021037,[''],AHRQ,"DAY BEFORE BIRTH, INC.",R13,2013,43924,0.03819992770470832
"American Psychosomatic Society's 70th Annual Scientific Meeting Conference Grant     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Providing strong support and guidance to promising pre- and post-doctoral students is crucial for the advancement of all fields of science. The overall goal of this competing renewal of R13 HL074923 is to provide travel support for trainees to attend and actively take part in the 71st Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society (APS) in Miami, Florida (March 13 - 16, 2013). The essential mission of the APS is to promote and advance the scientific understanding of the interrelationships among biological, psychological, social and behavioral factors in human health and disease, and the integration of the fields of science that separately examine each, and to foster the application of this understanding in education and improved health care. This mission is instantiated in the selection of the theme for the 2013 meeting, ""Impact and Innovation"" which will highlight empirical research, applied methodology, and clinical applications along the translational continuum. For greater than 60 years, the annual APS meeting has provided an outstanding forum for trainees and established investigators and clinicians working within a wide range of disciplines and specialty areas to exchange new ideas and research strategies that ultimately facilitate and improve the quality of research and its translation into clinical practice and publi policy. The annual APS meeting is attended by over 500 researchers and clinicians from around the world. For the past 7 years, NHLBI has been the sponsoring institute for this award given that the annual scientific meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society is the only scientific conference focused on the bio-psycho- social determinants and consequences of cardiovascular disease. Increasingly, this conference has also highlighted relationships among sleep and health. Support is also requested from other institutes (NCI, NCCAM, NIAMS, and NIDDK) given the diversity of disciplines and specialties represented at this meeting. In this competing renewal, we propose to provide support for up to 15 Young Scholar Awards and 5 Minority Initiative Travel Awards. The Young Scholars Award Program will provide travel awards to competitively- selected trainees who submit a first-author abstract to present a paper or poster and who are judged to show outstanding potential for a career in psychosomatic and behavioral medicine. The APS Minority Initiative Travel Award will provide support for promising trainees from racial/ethnic or other underrepresented groups to attend the annual meeting. The process of identifying and selecting APS Minority Initiative Travel Award recipients will differ, a this award seeks to extend trainee award opportunities to individuals who are not yet ""stakeholders"" in the process. The meeting's location in Miami and anticipated results from the NIH-sponsored multi-site Hispanic Community Health Study will capitalize on regional expertise in Latino health and health disparities, which has not been strongly represented on previous programs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Providing strong support and guidance to promising pre- and post-doctoral students is crucial for the advancement of all fields of science.

"Why We Cant Wait: Conference to Eliminate Health Disparities in Genomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities marginalize many racial and ethnic minorities within the American health care system. Despite steady improvement in the overall health of the United States, individuals within these underserved groups continue to be more vulnerable to lapses in care and are at increased risk for health problems. Health disparities have had an especially profound effect on the overall health of Hispanics/Latinos and Blacks in the United States. Genetic advances hold extreme promise, but also the potential to further increase health disparities. To promote equitable dissemination of the benefits of genomic medicine, genomic and translational research must be performed in diverse populations.  Unfortunately, minority populations are underrepresented in most research, including genetic research. The negative effects of this underrepresentation can already be seen in some of the current applications of genomic medicine. In addition, the paradigm shift in healthcare may also fuel health disparities. The Conference to Remedy Health Disparities aims to learn, identify, and discuss many of the challenges and possible solutions for addressing health disparities in genomic medicine. The conference will place greater emphasis on issues specific to the Latino/Hispanic and Black communities will  bring together a wider range of stakeholders who would not otherwise have the opportunity to interact and will  include data that has emerged since 2008, specifically with regard to the unique issues raised by sequencing.  We also plan to tie in the results of our discussion groups with extant initiatives and policies set forth by NIH health disparity agencies and publish the results of the forum to make it widely available to researchers and health professionals unable to attend the conference.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic advances hold extreme promise, but also the potential to further increase health disparities.  Now is the time to address this. We have assembled a forum of stakeholders to learn, identify, and discuss many of the challenges and possible solutions for addressing health disparities in genomic medicine.

"2013 Eye Movements: The Motor System that Sees the World GRC & GRS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The oculomotor system is arguably the best understood motor control system. Traditionally, oculomotor scientists studied each eye movement subsystem in isolation. Only recently have scientists turned their attention to more complex problems such as the neuronal control of combined vergence and saccadic eye movements or the neuronal control of combined saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements. Advances in these areas are opening up new topics of inquiry to the field of oculomotor neuroscience such as target selection - how does the brain select a single visual stimulus to guide eye movements? Is the process of selection the same for different eye movement subsystems or is it a shared mechanism? Do binocular disparity signals provide a low-level target selection mechanism for saccades or pursuit? Questions such as these are generating much excitement in the field and are producing results that have implications for the fields of visual neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience and computational neuroscience. As such, our goal in this application is to provide the oculomotor science community a forum to present and hear about cutting-edge research and to interact in an intimate, informal yet scientifically rigorous setting. In 2005, we held the first oculomotor Gordon Research Conference (GRC) ever, titled Oculomotor System Biology. The success of the first meeting resulted in second, sponsored GRC in 2007. The third and so far, most successful oculomotor GRC occurred in 2011, titled Eye Movements: The Motor System that Sees the World. The topics included: Eye Movements as a Probe for Attention, Perception, and Decision Making Mechanisms, in which the speaker's explored how the oculomotor system is used as a read-out for perceptual decision-making; The Action between Eye Movements, which explored the characteristics and control mechanisms for microsaccades and Central and Peripheral Oculomotor Subsystems in Health and Disease, which evaluated new findings about the role of peripheral mechanisms in controlling eye orientation. In the meeting scheduled for 2013 we hope to capitalize on the excitement generated from the 2011 meeting and plan to explore topics such as: Rodent Models for Higher Order Oculomotor Control; In this session the recent surge in the use of small mammals that are easily manipulated genetically to explore cognition and eye movements will be the theme. Beyond Black Boxes - New Computational Approaches for Understanding Oculomotor Control; in this session the topic of applying mathematical models to the oculomotor system such as Bayesian inference will be explored. More than Pretty Pictures- Lessons Learned from Imaging the Oculomotor System; in this session, we will explore how the technique of fMRI and other imaging methods enhances our understanding of the neural circuits underlying eye movements. This proposal requests support for a conference whose objective is to bring together scientists and physicians to discuss recent work in the oculomotor system. We plan to bring together early-career and established investigators to propel forward novel research venues and collaborations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disorders of eye movements and their consequences lead to complications that range in severity from blindness and low vision to the inability to perform routine tasks such as reading or crossing the street. Understanding the central and peripheral mechanisms of how eye movements are generated and controlled holds the key to reducing the public health burden of these disorders. Our goal of holding a meeting for early- career and well-established investigators of the oculomotor and visual systems to discuss the scientific progress in the field will go a long way toward shedding light on eye movement and visual diseases and their symptoms.                ",2013 Eye Movements: The Motor System that Sees the World GRC & GRS,8527325,R13EY023492,"['Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biomechanics ', ' Boxing ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brainstem ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mammalia ', ' Mammals ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Eye Movement Disorders ', ' Eye Motility Disorders ', ' Ocular Motility Disorders ', ' Orbital Cavity ', ' Orbit ', ' Eye Socket ', ' Ocular orbit ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' smooth pursuit eye movement ', ' SPEM ', ' Smooth Pursuit ', ' Reading ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Rotation ', ' Running ', ' Saccadic Pursuit ', ' Saccadic Eye Movements ', ' Saccades ', ' Science ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' Vertebrates ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Visual Disparity ', ' Retinal Disparity ', ' Ocular Parallax ', ' Ocular Disparity ', ' Fixation Disparity ', ' Binocular Disparity ', ' Vision Disparity ', ' visually impaired ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Low Vision ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Work ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' lateral geniculate nucleus ', ' lateral geniculate ', ' Lateral Geniculate Body ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' career ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Collaborations ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Head Movements ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Blindness ', ' gaze ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' visual processing ', ' success ', ' visual stimulus ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' ocularmotor ', ' ocular motor ', ' oculomotor ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Motor ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Visual Motion ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' fundamental research ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' visual neuroscience ', ' visual process ', ' visual control ', ' motor control ', ' public health relevance ', ' optogenetics ', ' ']",NEI,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2013,65000,0.059293187159352514
"PRIDE COORDINATION CENTER    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary:  This application seeks to address the organizational and support needs of several training programs that are engaged in efforts to increase diversity among scientists doing biomedical research (called PRIDE). The PRIDE programs conduct mentored Summer Institutes that are designed to enhance the career development of minority junior faculty and scientists by further developing their research skills and knowledge. This project will serve as the coordination core (CC) to support these training programs. The CC will facilitate the education and evaluation activities among programs by designing and overseeing a web-based infrastructure does the following. (1) Recruitment and outreach: The CC will use web-based informatics methods to develop and coordinate outreach efforts to recruit trainees to the Summer Institute programs. (2) Mentoring and Networking: The CC will coordinate efforts to identify mentors for the trainees (mentoring teams), to develop and conduct training workshops for the mentoring teams, to evaluate the effectiveness of the mentoring teams, and to identify and disseminate information on additional training and networking opportunities for the trainees. (3) Meetings: The CC will handle all plans and logistics for the CC to site-visit each program and for at least two annual meetings to be held in the Washington DC area. One annual meeting will be attended by the PIs and NHLBI staff (directors meeting) and another by all the NHLBI and program staff, faculty, mentees and mentors (Annual PRIDE Conference). (4) Communications: The CC will handle all communications including coordinating conference calls, recording and distributing minutes of calls and meetings, and creating web- based resources for program-wide needs such as posting directories, NIH policies and procedures, recruiting and application materials, newsletters, funding opportunities, and announcements.

"Community Network for Research Equity and Impact National Conference     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Collaboration with communities in research occurs along a continuum referred to as community-engaged research. Community-engaged research is recognized by the National Institutes of Health, researchers and community groups as critical to understanding and addressing differences in health status and health outcomes across race, ethnicity and income status. As a result, community groups are increasingly being approached by researchers seeking to conduct research in the communities they serve or have access to, and more community groups are initiating their own research studies. Universities and university-based health disparities researchers have established funding mechanisms for their research roles and networks for professional development, mentoring and advocacy. As more community groups are engaged in research, it is clear that they need their own such supports. We held successful community forums in 2011 and 2012 that laid the foundation for a national community partner network called the Community Network for Research Equity and Impact. The Community Network has identified a need for continued professional and leadership development of community groups engaged in research. The proposed conference, to be held in April 2014 in Chicago, will be the first national conference of the Community Network and will convene community organizations involved in health disparities research to deepen their knowledge and skills and position them for leadership roles in research practice and policy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Community-engaged research is recognized by the National Institutes of Health, researchers and community groups as critical to achieving health equity across diverse communities in the United States. By convening community groups that are involved in community-engaged health disparities research, our proposed conference will help to ensure that communities most affected by health disparities are at the decision making tables that decide what research gets conducted, how and by whom, and that they have the knowledge and skills to be effective research partners and to lead research. As a result, the proposed conference seeks to ensure that community-engaged health disparities research in the future can reach its full potential to improve the public's health.                ",Community Network for Research Equity and Impact National Conference,8652027,R13MD008673,"['Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' research in practice ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Safety Monitoring Boards ', ' Data and Safety Monitoring Boards ', ' Data Monitoring Committees ', ' Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees ', ' Review Committee ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Grant Review ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' community organizations ', ' research into practice ', ' research to practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Decision Making ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' ']",NIMHD,COMMUNITY-CAMPUS PARTNERSHIPS/HEALTH,R13,2013,50000,0.12848713561624447
"Gender-Specific Research in Emergency Care: Investigate, Understand and Translate  Gender medicine is the rapidly growing field of medicine that aims to provide equitable, safe, and cost- effective care for both male and female patients. While ""sex"" is the preferred term in basic science research, in this application we have used the term ""gender"" - referring to the socially constructed biological roles of an individual based on his or her XX or XY status - as it is more commonly used by clinicians. The focus of this field of medicine is gender-based biological differences in addition to the social mechanisms that influence the manifestation, diagnosis, and management of disease conditions. Significant gaps in gender-specific treatment and outcomes are evident in several spheres of emergency care especially neurological emergencies and resuscitation. These include cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury and neurological recovery, acute stroke, seizures, headaches as well as in resource utilization such as diagnostic imaging or device selection. Emergency departments (ED) form the core recruitment site and laboratory for clinical research trials studying such time-sensitive conditions. With a 24-hour presence in the ED and with access to patients in these spheres, emergency physicians play an ideal role in leading gender-specific clinical studies for acute neurological care and also serve as vital partners for interdisciplinary collaboration. The 2014 Academic Emergency Medicine (AEM) consensus conference, ""Gender Specific Research in Emergency Care - Investigate, Understand and Translate How Gender Affects Patient Outcomes"" will address this void by assembling clinicians, researchers, policy-makers, and basic and clinical scientists from multiple specialties to understand and investigate gender-related disparities in clinical outcomes of neurological emergencies. The conference will focus on high volume and resource-consuming ED visits with a particular focus on neurological emergencies. Specific aims of the workgroup are to: 1) Summarize and consolidate current data to improve our understanding of gender-specific research for neurological emergencies and identify critical gender-related gaps in knowledge in emergency care, 2) Create a research agenda that advances gender- specific research in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of neurological emergencies, and 3) Build a multinational interdisciplinary consortium to translate, disseminate and study gender medicine of acute neurological emergencies. A designated issue of AEM and invited specialty journals will disseminate the scientific summary, research agenda, and conference proceedings, as well as original research related to gender issues. The three-year planning phase of this conference will culminate in a one-day conference on May 13, 2014 in Dallas, Texas. The collaborative network established through this conference will also create an infrastructure for continued meaningful national collaborations on gender-specific research in emergency care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Emergency Departments (ED) serve over 136 million patients annually with 1: 1.2 ratio of male to female patients in the United States. Gender medicine investigates the biological and social mechanisms that influence disparities in diagnosis and clinical outcomes for male and female patients. This multidisciplinary conference will highlight this void in the emergency care and will develop a research agenda aimed to provide equitable, high quality, safe and cost-effective emergency care for male and female patients.                ","Gender-Specific Research in Emergency Care: Investigate, Understand and Translate",8720207,R13NS087861,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Critical Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Female ', ' head ache ', ' Head Pain ', ' Cranial Pain ', ' Cephalodynia ', ' Cephalgia ', ' Cephalalgia ', ' Headache ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patient Representative ', ' Patients ', ' t-PA ', ' Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue Activator D-44 ', ' T-Plasminogen Activator ', ' Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' Alteplase ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Seizures ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Collaborations ', ' Gender Issues ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' American ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Human Biology ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' response ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic encephalopathy ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Science Policy ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Emergency Care ', ' preclinical trial ', ' pre-clinical trial ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' preclinical study ', ' working group ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic emergencies ', ' Neurological emergencies ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' neurological recovery ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ']",NINDS,SOCIETY FOR ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE,R13,2014,10000,0.04188098857678787
"Recent Advances in AIDS and HIV Research Description (as provided by the applicant): Since 1998, the NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) have hosted an annual one day National CFAR Scientific Symposium in conjunction with the annual CFAR Directors'/Administrators' meeting. The purpose of the CFAR scientific symposium is to present, in a public forum, recent ""cutting edge"" advances in HIV/AIDS research for an average attendance of approximately 250-300. The intimate size of the meeting promotes opportunities for interactions between young and more senior investigators that would not be available at the larger annual scientific meetings related to HIV/AIDS. The meeting location rotates so that it is hosted each year by a different CFAR site. This provides geographic diversity for the venue and opportunities for a broader array of participants than for similar research symposia. As has been done for the past fifteen years, one of several AIDS-related research areas is the focus of the annual symposium. In 2011, the Duke University CFAR hosted the 15th Annual CFAR Research Symposium with focus on five scientific areas: ""Host-Viral Interactions during HIV Infection"", ""HIV-Associated Malignancies and Co-Infections"", ""Emerging Vaccine Strategies"", ""HIV/AIDS Health Disparities"", and ""Approaches to an HIV Cure"". Speakers were selected from the various NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research leadership, their scientific membership, and from nationally and internationally recognized research institutions. In addition to the participating CFAR Directors and invited leaders in the field, the remaining participants for the annual National CFAR Symposia are chosen based on specific criteria. First preference is given to young investigators who have received developmental funds from an NIH-funded CFAR program; second preference to young investigators with demonstrable potential in HIV/AIDS research; third preference is to other senior investigators engaged in HIV/AIDS research. In all cases women and individuals from underrepresented ethnic groups are encouraged to attend through targeted advertising and travel scholarships. Continuing Medical Education credits have been offered for attendees and access to web casts of the symposia are now available for interested investigators who are not able to attend. The purpose of the Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Symposium is to provide a venue to present and discuss recent advances in HIV/AIDS research. This is a unique forum for presentations of the most ""cutting edge"" research based on one of several AIDS-related topics.

"Conference grant application to support the American Psychosomatic Society's 72nd     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Providing strong support and guidance to promising pre- and post-doctoral students is crucial for the advancement of all fields of science. The overall goal of this competing renewal of R13 HL074923 is to provide travel support for trainees to attend and actively take part in the 72nd Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society (APS) in San Francisco, California (March 12 - 15, 2014). The essential mission of the APS is to promote and advance the scientific understanding of the interrelationships among biological, psychological, social and behavioral factors in human health and disease, and the integration of the fields of science that separately examine each, and to foster the application of this understanding in education and improved health care. This mission is instantiated in the selection of the theme for the 2014 meeting, ""Stretching the Boundaries: From Mechanisms of Disease to Models of Health,"" which will highlight empirical research, applied methodology, and clinical applications along the translational continuum. For greater than 7 decades, the annual APS meeting has provided an outstanding forum for trainees and established investigators and clinicians working within a wide range of disciplines and specialty areas to exchange new ideas and research strategies that ultimately facilitate and improve the quality of research and its translation into clinical practice and public policy. The annual APS meeting is attended by over 500 researchers and clinicians from around the world. For the past 8 years, NHLBI has been the sponsoring institute for this award given that the annual scientific meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society is the only scientific conference focused on the bio-psycho- social determinants and consequences of cardiovascular disease. Planned programming for the 2014 meeting includes a keynote address by NHLBI Director Dr. Gary Gibbons (invitation pending) and debate on the physiological underpinnings of heart rate variability and its prognostic relevance to cardiovascular disease featuring leading physiologists, cardiovascular behavioral medicine researchers, epidemiologists and clinicians and will provide a venue for evaluating the advantages, disadvantages, and promise of heart rate variability in relation to understanding the mechanisms through which social, psychological and behavioral factors influence health and disease. Regular presenters in Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine include Drs. Neil Schneiderman, Michael Irwin, Redford Williams, Margaret Chesney, Julian Thayer, Andrew Steptoe, Karen Matthews, Stephen Manuck, and Richard Lane. Increasingly, this conference has also highlighted relationships among sleep and health with accepted abstracts focused on sleep increasing by 80% in the last ten years (2003 - 2013). Support is also requested from other institutes (e.g., NCI, NCCAM) given the diversity of disciplines and specialties represented at this meeting. In this competing renewal, we propose to provide support for up to 15 Young Scholar Awards and 5 Minority Initiative Travel Awards. The Young Scholars Award Program will provide travel awards to competitively- selected trainees who submit a first-author abstract to present a paper or poster and who are judged to show outstanding potential for a career in psychosomatic and behavioral medicine. The APS Minority Initiative Travel Award will provide support for promising trainees from racial/ethnic or other underrepresented groups to attend the annual meeting. The process of identifying and selecting APS Minority Initiative Travel Award recipients will differ, as this award seeks to extend trainee award opportunities to individuals who are not yet ""stakeholders"" in the process. The meeting's location in California and anticipated results from the NIH- sponsored multi-site Hispanic Community Health Study will capitalize on regional expertise in Hispanic health and health disparities, which has not been strongly represented on previous programs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Providing strong support and guidance to promising pre- and post-doctoral students is crucial for the advancement of all fields of science.

"National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal for continued support of five yearly three-day stand-alone National Hispanic Science Network (NHSN) conferences. The NHSN is dedicated to improving health equity of Hispanics by increasing the amount, quality, and dissemination of interdisciplinary translational research; and fostering the development, advancement, and promotion of future Hispanic scientists and leaders. The NHSN conference will involve participation of members of the global research community focused on different aspects of alcohol and drug abuse including epidemiology, toxicology, environmental health, intervention science, psychology, sociology, health policy, and neurobiology as it pertains to Hispanic populations. The NHSN conference is unique in that it will congregate experts, who attend scientific conferences specific to their area of interest, and who otherwise would not have an opportunity to engage in this inter-professional and transdisciplinary scientific discourse. Because many of the socio cultural factors and co-morbid conditions relevant to Hispanic communities are shared with other underrepresented minority (URM) populations, we plan to expand the scope of the conference (on alternate years) to include African-American, Asian-American, Native-American workgroup participation. The proposed yearly conferences will continue to serve as the unique venue for transdisciplinary and inter-professional scientific discussions on strategies towards minimizing the impact of alcohol and drug abuse and their co-morbid conditions on health disparities in Hispanics and other URM. In addition, they will foster the recruitment, retention, development and advancement of Hispanic scientists to promote future leaders in areas related to alcohol and drug abuse research. This conference will provide an opportunity for trainees from diverse gender, ethnicity, discipline, and geographic locations to come together and participate in a multidisciplinary scientific meeting, establish peer-support groups, and develop professional relationships that will provide venues for innovative developments in the field.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics constitute the largest racial/ethnic minority population in the United States and are disproportionately impacted by alcohol and drug abuse. There is a pressing need to study the biological, individual, family, community, legal, and contextual factors that differentially affect substance use, its consequences, and the use of treatment services in Hispanic populations through inter-disciplinary and translational approaches. The proposed yearly conferences will continue to serve as the premier venue for transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and inter-professional scientific discussions on strategies towards minimizing the impact of alcohol and drug abuse on health disparities in Hispanics and other underrepresented minority groups.                ",National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference,8710788,R13DA026647,"['Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Communities ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Fertility/Fertilization ', ' Fertilization ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Louisiana ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Parents ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Sociology ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Discipline ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Native Americans ', ' Genetic ', ' Scientist ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' graduate student ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' Health Sciences ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Community Practice ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' dissemination research ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' translational approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NIDA,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R13,2014,73000,0.01962501436867382
"Why We Can't Wait: Conference to Eliminate Health Disparities in Genomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite steady improvement in the overall health of the United States, individuals within underserved groups continue to be more vulnerable to lapses in care and are at increased risk for health problems. Health disparities have had an especially profound effect on the overall health of Hispanics/Latinos and Blacks in the United States. Genetic advances hold extreme promise, but also the potential to further increase health disparities. To promote equitable dissemination of the benefits of genomic medicine, genomic and translational research must be performed in diverse populations. Unfortunately, minority populations are underrepresented in most research, including genetic research. Upwards of 96% of participants in genetic studies are of European ancestry. The negative effects of this underrepresentation can already be seen in some of the current applications of genomic medicine. In addition, changes in healthcare infrastructure resulting from genetically tailored care may also fuel health disparities. The Conference to Remedy Health Disparities aims to learn, identify, and discuss many of the challenges and possible solutions for addressing health disparities in genomic medicine, particularly with regard to policy (the theme of this year's conference). The conference will place greater emphasis on issues specific to the Latino/Hispanic and Black communities; will bring together a wider range of stakeholders who would not otherwise have the opportunity to interact; and will include recent data, specifically with regard to the unique issues raised by new technologies such as sequencing and epigenetics. We also plan to disseminate the content of the conference on the web to make it widely available to researchers and health professionals unable to attend the conference. Also, we will continue to record interviews of a selection of attendees and speakers about this topic, which we also plan to also make available for large scale dissemination.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic advances hold extreme promise, but also the potential to further increase health disparities. Now is the time to address this. We have assembled a forum of stakeholders to learn, identify, and discuss many of the challenges and possible solutions for addressing health disparities in genomic medicine. The results of this gathering will be made publicly available.                 ",Why We Can't Wait: Conference to Eliminate Health Disparities in Genomics,8785928,R13MD008154,"['Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Ethics Consultants ', ' Ethicists ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Specialist ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Genetic ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' allied health professional ', ' profession allied to medicine ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Prevention ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' minority health ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R13,2014,50000,0.06433695169649244
"African Caribbean Cancer Consortium Scientific and Training Conference     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The African-Caribbean Cancer Consortium (AC3) was conceived in 2006 for the study of viral, genetic and environmental risk factors in populations of African descent. The establishment of this Consortium has provided new collaborative opportunities for cancer research among investigators throughout the various islands in the Caribbean, United States and Africa. Since the establishment of the AC3, more than 100 investigators have joined and are conducting collaborative studies of cancer risk in the US, Caribbean islands and Africa. Cervical and prostate cancer studies are ongoing in US, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana as well as Nigeria. Head and neck cancer studies are ongoing in the US. Breast cancer studies are ongoing in the US, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Guyana. The studied populations include African-Americans, African-Caribbean, African as well as immigrant African-descent populations living in the US. We seek funding to support our next conference entitled ""Advancing Cancer Health Equity in Populations of African Descent."" The purpose of this conference is to strengthen our global cancer research efforts and develop trans-disciplinary studies that will help to understand the reasons behind cancer health disparities in risk, outcome and survivorship and their impact on Black populations globally. Our theme emphasizes a trans-disciplinary approach that extends beyond the documentation of health disparities through scientific presentations, and facilitates a multi-level research agenda that involves community education, technical/research training, collaborative research planning, and scientific exchange. This effort will support research collaborations that will help to promote the highest level of health among Black populations worldwide. We expect that the engagement of research (AC3 members and non-members) and community participants will promote knowledge transfer through scientific presentations and both educational and technical training workshops. A general assembly of the AC3 membership will promote the exchange of ideas for future collaborative research studies. The Steering Committee meeting will help to guide the leadership on the overall agenda, which is to obtain extramural funding for our collaborative studies. This will be an open conference. To promote cancer health equity, the following are the Specific Aims: 1) to facilitate knowledge transfer related to cancer risk and outcomes in African-descended populations, and promote the development and coordination of research studies involving African- American, African-Caribbean and African populations; 2) Promote diversity in health disparities research by providing a forum for training and career development for under-represented minority investigators and students; and 3) To provide culturally sensitive research information to the community in order to improve knowledge and awareness of cancer risk and prevention strategies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This conference fulfills a specific health problem in populations of African descent. African-Americans have significantly higher cancer incidence and mortality rates compared to other ethnic groups in the US. Cancer is among the top five leading causes of death in the Caribbean Islands and it is also anticipated that in Africa, over the next two decades cancer will become a growing threat of health.            ",African Caribbean Cancer Consortium Scientific and Training Conference,8838607,R13CA192672,"['Africa ', ' Awareness ', ' Bahamas ', ' Barbados ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Data Reporting ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' British Guiana ', ' Guyana ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Resources ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Incidence ', ' Island ', ' Jamaica ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nigeria ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Tobago ', ' United States ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Caribbean Islands ', ' West Indies ', ' Writing ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Training ', ' African ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' tool ', ' Trinidad ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' African Caribbean ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Training and Education ', ' cancer risk ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' virus genetics ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' career development ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Genomics ', ' Documentation ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Advocate ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R13,2014,12540,0.06894826358952295
"SNMA Annual Medical Education Conference: Physician Researcher Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Student National Medical Association (SNMA) Annual Medical Education Conference (AMEC) has emerged as a cornerstone activity for the organization. Students and professionals gather once a year, with high anticipation, to attend a wide range of educational and networking events. The AMEC attracts students from all levels of medical education and is consistently the largest gathering of under-represented minority medical students at any time in any place in the country. Employing a pivotal theme unique to the given year, the AMEC program incorporates several component tracks, each addressing a different level of educational and professional development. The Physician-Researcher Initiative (PRI) track serves to addresses the lack of minority physician-researchers, who are needed to combat health disparities. The PRI complements and aligns with the strategic objectives of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop the next generation of biomedical and behavioral scientists capable of addressing health disparities. To accomplish this, the PRI track during the AMEC aims to: (1) Promote and highlight the participation of pre-med/med student researchers at the SNMA AMEC, (2) Increase awareness of career options as a Physician Researcher, and (3) Facilitate Physician Researcher networking and mentor-matching opportunities during the conference and beyond. These aims will be achieved by executing specific programmatic objectives such as implementing new incentive programs through Travel Awards and sponsored WCJ Poster Forum prizes named for contributing NIH Institutes and Centers. Novel ways of collaborating with SNMA's existing network of NIH funded institutions to garner support for programming as well as facilitate pipeline mentoring will be explored. Expansion of the PRI comes as the result of increasing interest among the SNMA membership. With continued support by the NIH, we stand to better accomplish PRI's ultimate goal of addressing the need for more minority physicians involved in research.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): The paucity of underrepresented minorities conducting biomedical and behavioral research within academia and industry likely contributes to health disparities. By increasing awareness, advertising research opportunities, and providing mentors for SNMA members through the Physician Researcher Initiative, it is anticipated that more underrepresented minorities will be prepared to enter the field and succeed at becoming physician-researchers to help combat the complex diseases that disproportionately affect minority communities.

"Farmworker Housing Quality and Health: A Transdisciplinary Conference  Agricultural production in the United States (US) often requires the hand labor of agricultural workers.  Much of  this agricultural labor is provided by immigrant workers, who are largely Latinos/Hispanics from Mexico and  other Central American nations.  Farmworkers are among the most exploited populations in the US, and  migrant and seasonal farmworkers often reside in extremely poor housing conditions.  Farmworker housing is  an environmental health and justice concern as farmworkers have limited access to any housing, and the  housing to which they have access is often a component of their work environment that results in exposure to  chemical, biological, physical and psychological toxicants.  At the same time, current research on farmworker  housing and health is scattered in the literature, with a great deal of the information presented in non-peer- reviewed sources.  The peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed materials must be critically assessed and  compiled to provide the basis for further research, improve current housing standards, develop effective policy,  and provide training to farmworkers so that they can reduce their risks of health problems from poor quality  housing.  The goal of this conference is to draw together experts from the variety of disciplines who contribute  to research and practice focused on farmworker housing and health in order to delineate current knowledge  and propose next steps.  This one day conference will achieve four specific aims, it will:  (1) consolidate current  knowledge on characteristics and quality of housing provided for farmworkers, and the associations of  farmworker housing characteristics with farmworker health~ (2) delineate pertinent directions and areas for  farmworker housing health and safety research~ (3) delineate pertinent directions and areas for farmworker  housing health and safety policy~ and (4) facilitate the development of working groups to support the  implementation of research, education, and engineering projects that can address the major directions and  areas identified during the conference.  To achieve the specific aims, groups of experts will be commissioned  to complete three reports on farmworker housing, and the association of farmworker housing and health.   Presentations of these reports will be the key-note addresses for the conference.  The organizers also will  solicit volunteer presentations of new completed research and case studies.  The organizers will disseminate  the reports produced for this conference.  This conference responds to the themes and goals of the NIEHS  2012-2017 Strategic Plan:  Theme 4 Health Disparities and Global Environmental Health, and Theme 6  Communications and Engagement~ and Goals 6, 10, and 11.  The conference is being organized by the Center  for Worker Health, Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM), California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA) as part  of its ongoing Rural Justice Forums, and Farmworker Justice.  The conference will be held in conjunction with  the biennial National Farmworker Law Conference, in Arlington, Virginia, December, 2014.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Farmworker housing is an environmental health and justice concern as farmworkers have limited access to any housing, and the housing to which they have access is often a component of their work environment that results in exposure to chemical, biological, physical and psychological toxicants.

"Seventh AACR Conference on The Science of Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed conference, titled ""The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,"" will be held from November 9-12, 2014 in San Antonio, TX. This proposed conference will be the seventh in an AACR series focused specifically on the science of cancer health disparities. The previous conferences on The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved were held in 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. While most conferences on cancer health disparities focus on policy and public health issues, the goal of this conference is to incorporate perspectives from basic scientists and clinicians in conjunction with policy and public health. Transdisciplinary interactions between a variety of disciplines including basic science, clinical research, population science, behavioral research, and cancer survivorship, are needed to move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating disparities as they relate to cancer. Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer rates are well documented. While data suggest that access to quality care contributes to cancer disparities, other factors also play a major role, including tumor biology, genetics, hormonal status, lifestyle and behavior, screening policies, comorbidities, environmental exposure and risk, quality of and response to therapy, and post- therapeutic surveillance. The goal of this conference and the conference series is to bring together scientists and other professionals working in a variety of disciplines to discuss the latest findings in the field and to stimulate th development of new research in cancer health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer incidence and death statistics show that certain racial and ethnic groups in the United States suffer disproportionately from cancer and its associated effects. Although some disparities may be explained by socioeconomic factors, there is a biological basis as well. For example, research has identified differences in hormonal status and a number of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants that are more common among African Americans. Additionally, differences in inherited susceptibilities and molecular pathways for pathogenesis have been implicated as a source of prostate cancer disparities. This conference will bring together basic scientists, physicians, behavioral researchers, population researchers, and other health professionals to foster discussions and collaborations to move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating cancer health disparities.            ",Seventh AACR Conference on The Science of Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,8838554,R13CA192732,"['Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Research Technics ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Hormonal ', ' brca 2 gene ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 2 ', ' FANCD1 ', ' FANCB ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 2 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 2 Gene ', ' BRCA2 ', ' BRCA2 gene ', ' skills ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Population Sciences ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2014,74000,0.12865675677006178

"Recent Advances in AIDS and HIV Research Description (as provided by the applicant): Since 1998, the NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) have hosted an annual one day National CFAR Scientific Symposium in conjunction with the annual CFAR Directors'/Administrators' meeting. The purpose of the CFAR scientific symposium is to present, in a public forum, recent ""cutting edge"" advances in HIV/AIDS research for an average attendance of approximately 250-300. The intimate size of the meeting promotes opportunities for interactions between young and more senior investigators that would not be available at the larger annual scientific meetings related to HIV/AIDS. The meeting location rotates so that it is hosted each year by a different CFAR site. This provides geographic diversity for the venue and opportunities for a broader array of participants than for similar research symposia. As has been done for the past fifteen years, one of several AIDS-related research areas is the focus of the annual symposium. In 2011, the Duke University CFAR hosted the 15th Annual CFAR Research Symposium with focus on five scientific areas: ""Host-Viral Interactions during HIV Infection"", ""HIV-Associated Malignancies and Co-Infections"", ""Emerging Vaccine Strategies"", ""HIV/AIDS Health Disparities"", and ""Approaches to an HIV Cure"". Speakers were selected from the various NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research leadership, their scientific membership, and from nationally and internationally recognized research institutions. In addition to the participating CFAR Directors and invited leaders in the field, the remaining participants for the annual National CFAR Symposia are chosen based on specific criteria. First preference is given to young investigators who have received developmental funds from an NIH-funded CFAR program; second preference to young investigators with demonstrable potential in HIV/AIDS research; third preference is to other senior investigators engaged in HIV/AIDS research. In all cases women and individuals from underrepresented ethnic groups are encouraged to attend through targeted advertising and travel scholarships. Continuing Medical Education credits have been offered for attendees and access to web casts of the symposia are now available for interested investigators who are not able to attend. The purpose of the Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Symposium is to provide a venue to present and discuss recent advances in HIV/AIDS research. This is a unique forum for presentations of the most ""cutting edge"" research based on one of several AIDS-related topics.

"TransNet: Developing a Research Agenda in Transgender Health and Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an enormous unmet need for research in transgender health and medicine. Transgender people experience systemic health disparities. An obstacle to growth of our understanding of the health care needs of transgender people, and our ability to effectively promote transgender health, is the lack of opportunities for interdisciplinary scientists to meet and exchange ideas about the key issues and methodological challenges in advancing scientific knowledge and evidence-based prevention and care for transgender people. The scientific meeting on research in transgender health and medicine research organized by TransNet, a newly established consortium of researchers focusing on transgender health and medical research, will fill this gap. To be held in the spring of 2015 at a suitable Washington, DC area venue, the scientific meeting will draw together a diverse national group of experts and promising new scientists to advance the state of the science in the study of transgender health and medicine. The meeting core objectives will be to 1) further develop a productive transgender health and medicine research consortium that would become a national forum for an evolving comprehensive research agenda in transgender health, as well as a mechanism for interdisciplinary collaboration in research on cross-sex hormone therapies, surgical interventions, STI/HIV prevention, and trans-appropriate primary and mental health care; 2) develop new research methodologies effective in conducting clinical research with transgender people, a stigmatized, vulnerable, and underserved population; 3) develop and use of standardized approaches to data collection, management, and analysis across a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings; and 4) incorporate community engagement in the research process within the structure and function of the consortium, including transgender community advisory representatives, LGBT community health centers, and community engagement procedures throughout the research process. In response to ongoing advances in the field, an Organizing Committee will select key topics to be addressed at the meeting by the invited speakers and meeting participants. Areas of focus for the spring 2015 meeting include health disparities; gender identity development across the lifespan; clinical management of gender nonconforming children and adolescents; the safety and efficacy of transgender hormone regimens; innovative research methods; and opportunities for collaboration. The format of the proposed spring 2015 meeting includes scientific presentations by invited speakers, presentations of work in progress from leader investigators in transgender health, discussions of methodological problems and solutions, and working group breakout sessions to prioritize a research agenda in transgender health and medicine. Meeting participants will include researchers and clinicians representing the breadth of transgender health and medical research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed scientific meeting will contribute to an understanding of the medical, behavioral and social science aspects of transgender health, and serve as a forum to develop a plan for transgender health and medical research across the life continuum. The meeting will develop needed methodologies to engage in scientifically rigorous health research relevant to the transgender patients and their care.

"Conference grant application to support the American Psychosomatic Society's 73rd Annual Scientific Meeting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Providing strong support and guidance to promising pre- and post-doctoral students is crucial for the advancement of all fields of science. The overall goal of this competing renewal of R13 HL074923 is to provide travel support for trainees to attend and actively take part in the 73rd Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society (APS) in Savannah, Georgia (March 18 - 21, 2015). The essential mission of the APS is to promote and advance the scientific understanding of the interrelationships among biological, psychological, social and behavioral factors in human health and disease, and the integration of the fields of science that separately examine each, and to foster the application of this understanding in education and improved health care. This mission is instantiated in the selection of the theme for the 2015 meeting, ""From Cells to Community and Back,"" which will highlight empirical research, applied methodology, and clinical applications along the translational continuum. For greater than 7 decades, the annual APS meeting has provided an outstanding forum for trainees and established investigators and clinicians working within a wide range of disciplines and specialty areas to exchange new ideas and research strategies that ultimately facilitate and improve the quality of research and its translation into clinical practice and public policy. The annual APS meeting is attended by over 500 researchers and clinicians from around the world. For the past 9 years, NHLBI has been the sponsoring institute for this award given that the annual scientific meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society is the only scientific conference focused on the bio-psycho- social determinants and consequences of cardiovascular disease. Planned programming for the 2015 meeting includes a keynote address by Dr. Daniel J. Buysse, an invited symposium on the Jackson Heart Study updates, and a CDC symposium on the causes and consequences of health disparities. Regular presenters in Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine include luminaries such as Drs. Neil Schneiderman, Michael Irwin, Redford Williams, Margaret Chesney, Julian Thayer, Andrew Steptoe, Karen Matthews, Stephen Manuck, and Richard Lane. Increasingly, this conference has also highlighted relationships among sleep and health with accepted abstracts focused on sleep increasing by 80% from 2003 to 2013. Support is also requested from other institutes (e.g., NCI, NCCAM) given the diversity of disciplines and specialties represented at this meeting. In this competing renewal, we propose to provide support for up to 10 Young Scholar Awards and 5 Minority Initiative Travel Awards. The Young Scholars Award Program will provide travel awards to competitively- selected trainees who submit a first-author abstract to present a paper or poster and who are judged to show outstanding potential for a career in psychosomatic and behavioral medicine. The APS Minority Initiative Travel Award will provide support for promising trainees from racial/ethnic or other underrepresented groups to attend the annual meeting. The process of identifying and selecting APS Minority Initiative Travel Award recipients will differ, as this award seeks to extend trainee award opportunities to individuals who are not yet ""stakeholders"" in the process. The meeting's location in Georgia will capitalize on regional expertise in health disparities, with an emphasis on new data related to the causes and consequences of disparities in the ""stroke"" belt.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Providing strong support and guidance to promising pre- and post-doctoral students is crucial for the advancement of all fields of science.

"Basic, Clinical and Community Approaches to Solving Obesity Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of North Texas Health Science Center established the Texas Center for Health Disparities to conduct education, research and outreach activities to eliminate health disparities. As part of its education and outreach activitis, the Center has organized very successful annual health disparity conferences for the past nine years supported and funded in part by the National Institutes for Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) focusing on different areas of health disparities. The Tenth Annual Conference on Health Disparities will be held June 11-12, 2015 at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. The overall theme for the conference is ""Basic, Clinical and Community Approaches to Solving Obesity"". Although there has been documented progress in halting the dramatic increase in obesity over the past three decades, these improvements are not shared by all ethnic and racial groups. We are at a critical juncture of ensuring that improvements in obesity and related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, benefit diverse and underrepresented minority populations. Thus, this conference will bring together leaders in clinical, community, and basic science in order to inform and develop solutions to address obesity and related chronic diseases in communities experiencing health disparities. We chose the theme based on input and feedback from our Community Advisory Board in order to meet the needs of our community. Educational and interactive presentations, panel discussions and questions/ answer sessions will identify the challenges and bring conference attendees closer to developing a prospectus for the future. The Specific Aims of this application are: 1) Enhance health disparity knowledge of the health care practitioners and policy makers, and 2) Serve as a resource for the minority communities to disseminate health information, promote community participation in health education and research, and to implement disease prevention activities. The expected outcome will be increased participation of health care practitioners in minority communities and awareness of policy makers in the existing health disparities related to obesity and associated chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities are a significant challenge to the health and wellbeing of Americans.

The funded early career investigators will be invited to actively participate in researching and writin needs assessment and gap analysis data for the purposes of developing strong continuing medical education curricula and programs. NMA Internal Medicine Section senior faculty will be available to serve as mentors for this activity. There are four objectives to this conference session: 1) Provide a forum for cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas to further explore issues of health  disparities in the areas of endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism, HIV/AIDS, gastroenterology,  cardiology, and nephrology. 2) Foster opportunities for early stage minority faculty and trainee investigators to network and  further learn about current research in the internal medicine areas of endocrinology, diabetes,  and metabolism, HIV/AIDS, gastroenterology, cardiology, and nephrology. 3) Promote opportunities for early stage faculty and trainee investigators to present research  findings and interact with more senior investigators working in the internal medicine areas of  endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism, HIV/AIDS, gastroenterology, cardiology, and nephrology. 4) Provide a mentoring platform for early career minority investigators to play a sustained role in  contributing to futur scientific conventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     There is a need to educate physicians and young investigators about the current trends in the areas of internal medicine that impact minority populations as minorities often suffer disproportionate prevalence and incidence rates and negative outcomes. There is also a need to educate practicing physicians in the area of current subspecialty topics that are important to diverse populations of whom they serve. Significant disparities exist in the areas of endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism, HIV/AIDS, gastroenterology, cardiology, and nephrology.            ","Exploration of Health Disparities in the areas of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, HIV/AIDS, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, and, Pulmonology, and Nephrology in the African American Community",8986360,R13DK107247,"['abstracting ', ' Award ', ' Cardiovascular Disease (Specialty) ', ' Cardiology ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' continuing medical education ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Endocrinology ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Future ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Generalists ', ' Grant ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' Incidence ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Michigan ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephrology ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Pulmonology ', ' Pulmonary Medicine ', ' Pneumonology ', ' Pneumology ', ' Pulmonary Disease (Specialty) ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Seasons ', ' Travel ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Specialist ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' member ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' trend ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDDK,NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,R13,2015,50000,0.12517446681391195
"2015 International Society for Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE) Conference ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 27th Annual Conference of the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE) will be held at the Rebouças Conference Center, School of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, from August 30th to September 3rd, 2015. This year's conference theme will be ""Addressing Environmental Health Inequalities"", and the scientific program will be oriented by the theme of social determinants of health, and how they can generate environmental health inequalities.  The meeting will be comprised of four and half days of presentation of new and developing research, and will offer a platform for discussion and collaboration across a wide variety of scientific fields of interest in the field of environmental public health. The conference will include plenary sessions with invited keynote speakers, oral and poster presentations of research selected by the Scientific Planning Committee from submitted abstracts, and breakout sessions allowing for in-depth discussion of specific topics across the field of environmental epidemiological research. Examples of topics include: the exposure and health effects of air pollution, global climate change, the built environment, persistent organic pollutants, and epidemiologic methods. Meeting goals are to present our current understanding of issues in environmental epidemiology, and provide novel research strategies to ameliorate the health impacts of environmental agents. The meeting will welcome participants from developed and developing nations, and the organizers will facilitate the attendance of participants from developing countries to assure representation from not only North America and Western Europe, but also researchers from Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, Africa, South and Central America, and Australia. By awarding travel grants and registration fee waivers funded by this proposed grant application, the organizers will ensure participation and presentations by investigators from low-income developing countries and underserved minorities. The requested funds will also offset the costs associated with publication and dissemination of the conference proceedings.  The 2015 conference location in Sao Paulo, Brazil will significantly enhance the public health impact by facilitating the exchange of information and ideas among epidemiologic investigators and public health practitioners in South America, a part of the world with many of the problems to be addressed at this meeting but who have been underrepresented in past meetings on other continents. Subjects of particular relevance to participants from the Latin-America region will be encouraged. In addition, to maximize these benefits, the meeting is being conducted in association with Brazilian Public Health Association (ABRASCO). This will be the first such meeting on this continent, and will result in many new research interactions and collaborations with the rest of the world. This conference will facilitate the development of novel strategies to ameliorate public health burdens imposed by environmental hazards.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ISEE annual conference plays a vital role in facilitating a dialogue among leading environmental epidemiologists.

"International Conference on Stigma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite significant advances in treatment, HIV continues to spread in the US and globally with minimal decrease in the rate of new infections. Of the 1.2 million persons living with HIV in the US less than 45% receive regular care and 28% have undetectable viral load with serious racial disparities in incidence, prevalence and outcomes. Social factors, such as stigma, have a major impact on the outcome of all illnesses, but nowhere is this effect more evident than in the case of HIV. Stigma, a degrading attitude towards the affected person is a major barrier to HIV prevention and treatment that has not been fully addressed. While we have many new medications for treatment of HIV, few efforts have been made to overcome the powerful forces of stigma. Kaiser Family Foundation surveys over the past 10 years show little if any change in the attitude of people towards those with HIV. Howard University, a historically Black institution, has orchestrated 5 highly successful annual stigma conferences since December 1, 2010. These conferences have promoted research and impacted the narrative about HIV in the media, policy, and service delivery. Methods: The proposed International Conference on Stigma will be the sixth held since 2010 and will take place on November 20, 2015 at Howard University Blackburn Center. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers, community and faith leaders, media, policy makers, academia, students, human rights advocates and affected individuals with emphasis on inclusion of all but especially racial and gender minorities and women. Howard University and its partners, organized under Coalition for Elimination of AIDS/HIV Stigma (CEAS), have a well experienced and established structure of committees and volunteers to orchestrate this event. The conference has had an impressive web presence with its webpage--www.whocanyoutell.org, LinkedIn, Facebook, you tube, and Howard University webpage. The conference would include a plenary session, 6 workshops, personal stories, spoken word, musical performances, scientific poster presentations, students' art project and networking opportunities. We expect an attendance of 500 to 700 at this conference. The conference would be webcast live and the lectures/workshops will be archived on our website. The main theme of the conference this year is: ""Looking Inward, Moving Forward."" Specific objectives for the participants include: (1) describe the impact of stigma on human rights of affected individuals and its role in impeding prevention efforts for HIV; (2) list effective strategies to mitigate stiga and improve outcomes; (3) describe specific examples from attendee's lives (personal and professional) of stigma and its impact on individuals; (4) design strategies to recognize and address stigmatizing behaviors and policies in their environment; and (5) describe plans to promote and establish research programs in the area of stigma. Process and outcomes evaluation will be implemented to determine the extent to which the conference meets its goals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV disproportionately affects racial and gender minorities and the stigma associated with HIV is a major public health debacle impeding treatment and prevention efforts. The stigma conference will bring together community, academia, policy makers, faith leaders and students to discuss the role of individuals, communities and leaders in perpetuating stigma and interventions to eliminate this public health problem. The conference will include plenary sessions, workshops, personal stories, spoken word, musical performances, scientific poster presentations, student art projects, live webcasting etc. to highlight the importance of stigma on human lives and health outcomes.            ",International Conference on Stigma,9049764,R13MD010425,"['lectures ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Advocate ', ' International ', ' Process ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' volunteer ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' webpage ', ' web page ', ' Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' Archives ', ' Arts ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Rights ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Ownership ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Tube ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Hemohistioblast ', ' Hemocytoblast ', ' Hematohistioblast ', ' Ferrata cell ', ' Blasts ', ' Blast Cell ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' Life ', ' posters ', ' ']",NIMHD,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,R13,2015,49966,0.12025401562454097
"National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal for continued support of five yearly three-day stand-alone National Hispanic Science Network (NHSN) conferences. The NHSN is dedicated to improving health equity of Hispanics by increasing the amount, quality, and dissemination of interdisciplinary translational research; and fostering the development, advancement, and promotion of future Hispanic scientists and leaders. The NHSN conference will involve participation of members of the global research community focused on different aspects of alcohol and drug abuse including epidemiology, toxicology, environmental health, intervention science, psychology, sociology, health policy, and neurobiology as it pertains to Hispanic populations. The NHSN conference is unique in that it will congregate experts, who attend scientific conferences specific to their area of interest, and who otherwise would not have an opportunity to engage in this inter-professional and transdisciplinary scientific discourse. Because many of the socio cultural factors and co-morbid conditions relevant to Hispanic communities are shared with other underrepresented minority (URM) populations, we plan to expand the scope of the conference (on alternate years) to include African-American, Asian-American, Native-American workgroup participation. The proposed yearly conferences will continue to serve as the unique venue for transdisciplinary and inter-professional scientific discussions on strategies towards minimizing the impact of alcohol and drug abuse and their co-morbid conditions on health disparities in Hispanics and other URM. In addition, they will foster the recruitment, retention, development and advancement of Hispanic scientists to promote future leaders in areas related to alcohol and drug abuse research. This conference will provide an opportunity for trainees from diverse gender, ethnicity, discipline, and geographic locations to come together and participate in a multidisciplinary scientific meeting, establish peer-support groups, and develop professional relationships that will provide venues for innovative developments in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics constitute the largest racial/ethnic minority population in the United States and are disproportionately impacted by alcohol and drug abuse. There is a pressing need to study the biological, individual, family, community, legal, and contextual factors that differentially affect substance use, its consequences, and the use of treatment services in Hispanic populations through inter-disciplinary and translational approaches. The proposed yearly conferences will continue to serve as the premier venue for transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and inter-professional scientific discussions on strategies towards minimizing the impact of alcohol and drug abuse on health disparities in Hispanics and other underrepresented minority groups.",National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference,8841332,R13DA026647,"['Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Communities ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Fertility/Fertilization ', ' Fertilization ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Louisiana ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Parents ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Sociology ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Discipline ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Native Americans ', ' Genetic ', ' Scientist ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' Health Sciences ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Community Practice ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' dissemination research ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' translational approach ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NIDA,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R13,2015,93000,0.01962501436867382
"Undocumented, Unaccompanied, and Citizen: Charting Research Directions for Children of Immigration ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This conference focuses on three vulnerable groups of children of immigration: (1) undocumented children (UND) brought into the US by undocumented immigrant parents; (2) unaccompanied alien children (UAC) entering from Mexico and Central America; and (3) citizen-children (CC) who are the US-born offspring of undocumented immigrants in mixed-status families (MSF). Without access to education, healthcare, and social services, these children are likely to suffer prolonged childhood adversities, locking them into the lowest socio-economic class, even if achieving legal alien status. The children's future should be of concern not only to those on the frontlines of schools, mental health, health, and youth development but to all concerned with the future wellbeing of our nation. The purpose of this conference is to set a national research agenda in behavioral and social sciences. We have, therefore, set four aims to be achieved. Aim 1 is to discuss the current knowledge of the development, health, mental health, and psychological and social experiences of UND, CC, and UAC from childhood through adolescence. Aim 2 is to identify theoretical, conceptual, empirical, and methodological gaps in knowledge as well as ethical challenges in conducting research with these vulnerable children and their families. Aim 3 is to propose a research agenda to inform the directions that established and emerging scholars can pursue on the developmental, psychological, and social wellbeing of UND, CC, and UAC, and MSF. Aim 4 is to facilitate ongoing interaction and research collaborations among conferees, especially junior investigators, through the establishment of an online community of scholars. A multidisciplinary group of conferees (e.g., anthropology, child development, psychology, public health, social work, sociology) will discuss the current knowledge of the developmental, physical, mental health, psychological and social experiences of these children and propose a research agenda to inform the directions scholars can pursue to advance knowledge and inform practices, services, and policies directed toward their health and wellbeing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A conference focused on the undocumented and citizen-children of undocumented immigrants, and unaccompanied minors, reflects widely held concerns about the impact on our nation's health of children and families living in the shadows of society. Healthy People 2020 notes the need for studying the social conditions affecting children, especially vulnerable groups such as those that are the focus of the conference. The Institute of Medicine (2009) states authoritatively that children's mental disorders are too commonplace and have life-long effects on them, their families, and communities. With the prolonged stress of being undocumented or fearing parents' deportation, undocumented, unaccompanied, and citizen- children face many adverse childhood experiences. This conference underscores the public health significance of setting a coherent national research agenda.            ","Undocumented, Unaccompanied, and Citizen: Charting Research Directions for Children of Immigration",9053219,R13MD010415,"['Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Social Policies ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Societies ', ' Sociology ', ' Solutions ', ' Stress ', ' United States ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' Work ', ' Shadowing (Histology) ', ' Shadowing ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Child Mental Disorders ', ' court ', ' Area ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Ensure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Legal Status ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' offspring ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Subgroup ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' social science research ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Alien ', ' Anthropology ', ' Attention ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Central America ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Minor ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Prejudice ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R13,2015,50000,0.04460326578811339
"Eighth AACR Conference on The Science of Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed conference, titled ""The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,"" will be held from November 13-16, 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia. This proposed conference will be the eighth in an AACR series focused specifically on the science of cancer health disparities. The previous conferences on The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved were held in 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. While most conferences on cancer health disparities focus on policy and public health issues, the goal of this conference is to incorporate perspectives from basic scientists and clinicians in conjunction with policy and public health. Transdisciplinary interactions between a variety of disciplines including basic science, clinical research, population science, behavioral research, and cancer survivorship, are needed to move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating disparities as they relate to cancer. Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer rates are well documented. While data suggest that access to quality care contributes to cancer disparities, other factors also play a major role, including tumor biology, genetics, hormonal status, lifestyle and behavior, screening policies, comorbidities, environmental exposure and risk, quality of and response to therapy, and post- therapeutic surveillance. The goal of this conference and the conference series is to bring together scientists and other professionals working in a variety of disciplines to discuss the latest findings in the field and to stimulate th development of new research in cancer health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer incidence and death statistics show that certain racial and ethnic groups in the United States suffer disproportionately from cancer and its associated effects. Although some disparities may be explained by socioeconomic factors, there is a biological basis as well. For example, research has identified differences in hormonal status and a number of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants that are more common among African Americans. Additionally, differences in inherited susceptibilities and molecular pathways for pathogenesis have been implicated as a source of prostate cancer disparities. This conference will bring together basic scientists, physicians, behavioral researchers, population researchers, and other health professionals to foster discussions and collaborations to move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating cancer health disparities.            ",Eighth AACR Conference on The Science of Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,9053660,R13CA203380,"['Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Research Technics ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Hormonal ', ' brca 2 gene ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 2 ', ' FANCD1 ', ' FANCB ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 2 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 2 Gene ', ' BRCA2 ', ' BRCA2 gene ', ' skills ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Population Sciences ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2015,74000,0.12884082733627195
"Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Workforce Diversity and Healthcare Disparities Project Summary: The current proposal aims to support a diversity-focused workshop at the annual meeting of the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO) in April 2017. This will be a continuation of a series of annual workshops organized by the Diversity Special Interest Group (SIG). These diversity-oriented workshops have received NIH R13 grant support (NCI/NHLBI) for 5 of the past 6 years. We hypothesize that the longitudinal effects of these workshops serve to increase awareness of the multifaceted and complex goals of increasing diversity and facilitating advancement of under-represented individuals in our field. We propose to capitalize on these achievements by continuing this workshop series while adding an outreach activity to the medical students in the host city of the annual meeting (Montreal, Quebec, Canada for the 2017 meeting). A 2015 ASPHO workforce survey revealed significant ethnic disparities in ASPHO membership, consistent with known trends of under-representation of ethnic minorities in medicine as a whole. Anecdotally, there appears to be a significant lack of African American, Hispanic, and other ethnic representation in ASPHO leadership positions. This is partially reflective of the general ASPHO membership, and it is likely representative of the larger field of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology. We hypothesize that these disparities can be reduced over time through a combination of educational programs aimed at increasing cultural awareness among existing ASPHO members and direct mentoring of under-represented medical students and uncommitted residents (i.e., not matched to a subspecialty fellowship) in order to increase the likelihood that they choose to enter Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and aspire to leadership roles. The theme of our 2017 workshop will be “Workforce Diversity and Healthcare Disparities.” This workshop will be open to all ASPHO conference attendees and will include: (i) a brief annual business meeting for the ASPHO Diversity SIG, (ii) a keynote address from a leader in global sickle cell disease care and healthcare disparities, and (iii) an intensive attendee-driven networking exercise to identify how diversity-related gaps in the existing Pediatric Hematology/Oncology workforce impact healthcare disparities and generate recommendations for improving outcomes for patients from under-represented groups by improving provider diversity. A key component of this year's workshop will be the expansion of trainee travel awards to include sponsorship of conference registrations for medical students who attend the McGill University in Montreal. We will continue to offer travel awards to fellowship trainees with diverse backgrounds as well as under-represented junior trainees [medical students (from outside Montreal) and residents] who will be paired with faculty “guides.” These guides will ensure that the sponsored trainees are able to optimize their conference experience and provide a point-of- contact and mentorship within the field of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology as they begin to make career development plans well after the conference concludes. Project Narrative Ethnic minorities, women, and other diversity groups are under-represented in leadership positions for medical specialties and pediatric subspecialties, including Pediatric Hematology/Oncology which may contribute to health disparities that commonly affect underrepresented individuals. Working together, the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO) leadership and general membership are using a variety of approaches to advance diversity issues within ASPHO. In the current application, we propose to host a diversity-oriented workshop during the 2017 ASPHO annual meeting to address barriers to entry and advancement for trainees and professionals from diverse backgrounds with the goal to ultimately improve the care of underrepresented individuals affected by blood and oncologic disorders.",Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Workforce Diversity and Healthcare Disparities,9261299,R13CA213938,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Affect ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Canada ', ' Cities ', ' Demographic Survey ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exercise ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' parity ', ' Patients ', ' Quebec ', ' Recommendation ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Medical Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Businesses ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' special interest group ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' clinical care ', ' Pediatric Hematology ', ' improved outcome ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' underserved minority ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NCI,INDIANA HEMOPHILIA & THROMBOSIS CENTER,R13,2016,9200,0.037203920329843626
"The People's Scientific Conference to Promote Minority Health through Community-Based Participatory Research: CHWs Lead the Way Minority health promotion is a high priority in Florida given health data evidencing that minorities in this state are disproportionately burdened by health disparities. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is well-suited for developing culturally sensitive interventions to promote minority health. Community health workers (CHWs) are valuable partners in conducting such research. The Florida CHW Coalition (FCHWC), Inc. is spearheading efforts to include CBPR research training in the Florida CHW certification process and is calling attention to the roles CHWs can and do play in minority health promotion-focused CBPR. Thus, the FCHWC, Inc., the University of Florida Health Disparities Research and Intervention Program, and the Florida Health Equity Research Institute are partnering to spearhead the proposed conference titled The People’s Scientific Conference to Promote Minority Health through CBPR: CHWs Lead the Way.  The broad, long-term objectives of this conference are to (a) increase participation in and leadership of minority health promotion-focused CBPR among CHWs and other community members and stakeholders, health researchers, providers, junior faculty, and doctoral/medical students in Florida and across the nation and (b) identify the barriers to CHW-partnered minority health promotion-focused CBPR and strategies to overcome these barriers so as to increase this type of research.

"2017 LGBTQ Health Conference: Bridging Research and Practice Project summary/abstract The 2017 LGBTQ Health Conference will bring together leading researchers and practitioners, trainees and students to bridge research and practice with the aim of addressing health disparities for LGBTQ populations. This proposal requests funding for a 3-day conference in Chicago, the 5th annual LGBTQ Health Conference, organized by a long-term successful academic-community partnership between the Northwestern IMPACT LGBT Health and Development Program (now the Northwestern Institute for Sexual and Gender Minority Health and Wellbeing) and Center on Halsted, the most comprehensive LGBTQ community center in the Midwest. The conference aims to improve both research and practice on LGBTQ health by convening leading practitioners and researchers to present and discuss cutting-edge translational findings in the field; to train the next generation of practitioners and researchers in LGBTQ health; and to disseminate the findings to a broad group of audiences that includes the general public, policymakers, LGBTQ communities nationwide in addition to academics, clinicians and service providers. A major goal of the conference is to increase participation by traditionally underrepresented groups in science, including women and transgender people, racial/ethnic minorities and people with disabilities, not only as audience members but as organizers, presenters, keynote speakers and moderators. In the past, our LGBTQ Health Conferences have stimulated new research and collaborations, trained clinicians and service providers, and created opportunities for trainees, students, and junior investigators to learn and connect with leaders in the field. We plan to build on our past accomplishments to expand the 2017 Conference from one to three days, thus increasing the number of lectures, panel sessions, networking opportunities, poster presentations and by expanding our successful Professional Development Institute. The overall goal of this Conference is to catalyze research to reduce and eventually eliminate health disparities among LGBTQ people. These disparities are severe and affect LGBTQ people's life expectancy, mental and physical health, access to and quality of care, and overall quality of life. Critical disparities are found in risk and incidence of mental health issues including suicide, substance abuse, HIV and other STIs and are linked to minority status, stigma, discrimination, and denial of human and civil rights. As is the case among other minorities experiencing disparities, these disparities are not born equally among all LGBTQ people: transgender people, LGBTQ people of color and low-income people bear a disproportionate burden of these disparities. The proposed 2017 LGBTQ Health Conference will be a unique opportunity to gather the best knowledge and practice in the field through an intersectional lens to improve the lives of all LGBTQ people. We propose to organize and hold the 5th annual LGBTQ Health Conference: Bridging Research and Practice in Chicago, Illinois, in 2017. LGBTQ people have been identified as a population experiencing health disparities, based on dramatic inequities in disease prevalence, access to care, and availability of prevention services. These disparities are due to their minority status, societal stigma, discrimination, and denial of their civil and human rights. Specifically, mental health problems, substance abuse and suicide have been associated with discrimination against LGBTQ individuals. The LGBTQ Health Conference is an interdisciplinary research conference whose goal is to bridge science and practice in order to eliminate LGBTQ health disparities.

"21st International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2016), Durban, South Africa, 17-22 July 2016 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although advances in both treatment and prevention over the past two decades have been remarkable, significant challenges remain ahead. These include the large burden of aging patients with HIV and co- infections and co-morbidities, the sustainability of treatment for millions of patients in countries with weak health systems, ongoing HIV incidence in many key populations, and the ongoing research challenges in cure and vaccine science. Against this background, the 21st International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2016) to be held in Durban, South Africa from 17-22 July 2016, will provide a platform for science, policy, service, and advocacy in support of moving towards implementation of the full range of prevention and treatment options currently available, while at the same time further pushing towards novel prevention strategies, optimized treatment, a vaccine and cure. When the International AIDS Conference was last held in Africa, in Durban in 2000, access to ART drugs was negligible across the continent, HIV science had yielded few effective HIV prevention tools, and donor spending on AIDS amounted to only a small fraction of current funding levels. Fifteen years later, South Africans - with substantial support and leadership from the United States Government, The Global Fund, EU, and other donors - have built a robust response that includes cutting edge scientific research and innovative implementation strategies. The country treats more citizens, and is home to more people living with HIV, than any other. And across Africa, the epicenter of HIV, a number of countries, including some low income ones, are aggressively addressing their epidemics. Translating what has worked in this region to others is vital to reducing new HIV infections and AIDS morbidity and mortality worldwide. The specific aims of AIDS 2016 are:  1. Bring together the world's HIV experts at the epicenter of the epidemic to advance knowledge about HIV  science, present new research findings, and promote and enhance scientific and community  collaborations around the world in order to reduce incidence, optimize treatment, and improve the  response to co-morbidities;  2. Advance the latest global scientific strategy for HIV cure research which will be unveiled at AIDS 2016;  and for HIV vaccine research, including the follow-on studies of the RV-144 candidates in Africa;  3. Promote HIV research, including transdisciplinary and human rights-based approaches, that is tailored to  those living with HIV or at risk: women and girls, men who have sex with men, transgender individuals,  sex workers, adolescents and young adults and people who use drugs;  4. Support the scale up of the global HIV response through significantly strengthened implementation  science across prevention, treatment and care;  5. Showcase the depth of North-South HIV research collaboration that is centered on South Africa, provide  a platform for the integration of excellent young African researchers into global scientific networks, and  facilitate South-South research collaborations and learning, including in Implementation Science. The scientific programme will consist of five tracks: A - Basic and Translational Research; B - Clinical Research; C - Epidemiology and Prevention Research; D - Social and Political Research, Law, Policy and Human Rights; and E - Implementation Research, Economics, Systems and Synergies with other Health and Development Sectors. Additionally, a symposium reviewing the latest advancements in HIV cure research will be organized in conjunction with the conference. AIDS 2016 will continue the IAC's unique focus on the intersection of science, policy, implementation and advocacy. Issues of prevention, treatment and care for key populations will be a major focus of the scientific program, particularly with regard to settings where gender-based violence and criminalization impact program effectiveness. The HIV-specific needs of adolescents will feature prominently at AIDS 2016 with significant involvement of young people themselves in scientific and policy discussions. The International AIDS Society will take special steps to ensure the most inclusive and representative AIDS conference by doubling the number of delegates from resource-limited settings and key populations through full or partial scholarship support, and by creating specific mechanisms to support women and youth. Innovative elements at AIDS 2016 include a more interactive approach built on debate style conference sessions and enhanced social media and online platform use, to not only communicate conference results to external audiences but to actively engage these during the meeting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: AIDS 2016, to be held from 17-22 July 2016 in Durban, South Africa, will serve as a key global platform to review and discuss the science and future of HIV prevention, HIV vaccine research, HIV cure and work in co- infections and co-morbidities. South Africa has demonstrated the feasibility of rapid progress against AIDS through strong political leadership, innovation in service delivery, and community leadership and engagement, but at the same time continues to have the largest burden of disease and to struggle with stigma and other challenges that have hindered progress particularly with regard to stemming new infections among adolescents and some key populations. While offering delegates the opportunity to benefit from learning about the successes and challenges in this particular setting, the conference is expected to draw significant numbers of participants from across Africa, thus providing a platform for broad scientific and policy exchange between specialists from the U.S, Europe, Asia and other regions with their African peers.        ","21st International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2016), Durban, South Africa, 17-22 July 2016",9135639,R13AI124757,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Africa ', ' Aging ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Asia ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Europe ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human Rights ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Laws ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Scholarship ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' South Africa ', ' Provincial Government ', ' State Government ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Vaccines ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' HIV vaccine ', ' human immunodeficiency virus vaccine ', ' HIV/AIDS Vaccines ', ' Injectable ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' transgender ', ' success ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' peer ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Low income ', ' Dapivirine ', ' TMC120-R147681 ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Province ', ' International AIDS ', ' Science Policy ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Update ', ' Vaccine Research ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' implementation research ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' stem ', ' implementation science ', ' public health relevance ', ' product development ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' co-infection ', ' coinfection ', ' social media ', ' gender-based violence ', ' South African ', ' gender disparity ', ' ']",NIAID,IAS,R13,2016,1175000,0.04184090220731222
"2016 Annual Meeting of the Pan-American Society for Pigment Cell Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Pan-American Society for Pigment Cell Research (PASPCR) is preparing to hold the 20th Annual PASPCR Meeting in Baltimore, Maryland on October 5-8, 2016, spearheaded by PASPCR President-Elect Thomas J. Hornyak, M.D., Ph.D. The University of Maryland School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore will be the applicant organization. The meeting will be held nearby on the Baltimore Inner Harbor at the Royal Sonesta Inner Harbor, which has extensive experience sponsoring medical and scientific events for local institutions including the University of Maryland, Baltimore and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The 2016 PASPCR Meeting theme, “Seeing the Light: Pigment Cells, Their Responses, and the Generation of Diversity” will focus upon the biology and biochemistry of pigment cells across the phylogenetic spectrum, emphasizing their normal and abnormal responses to environmental stimuli and external signals in normal and disease processes. Ample opportunity will be available for young investigators, including graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, to present their recent advances in pigment cell biology. A unique feature of the meeting is the emphasis on mentoring, with the opportunity for trainees and young investigators to learn from more experienced investigators in academia, government, and industry in both structured and one-on-one forums. The scientific organizing committee has identified selected basic and clinical scientists from the United States and Europe to participate in the conference as invited speakers. These individuals represent a diverse spectrum of experience and interests and have been chosen because of their expertise that is aligned with the overall theme and goals of the meeting. The ultimate goal of the PASPCR 2016 Annual Meeting is to stimulate interdisciplinary discussions between clinicians, basic researchers, and pigment cell researchers, leading to new collaborations and insights that will advance the field. Although members of PASPCR are well- represented at other traditional discipline-oriented conferences, this forum is unique in that it brings together investigators from different disciplines, ranging from chemistry, genetics, developmental biology, and the clinic, in an intimate setting in order to spawn new scientific interactions and collaborations. The overall objective of PASPCR 2016 is to increase our knowledge of the normal and abnormal chemistry and biology of the melanocyte, its role in the generation of species and individual diversity, and its contribution to health and disease. The specific aims of the PASPCR 2016 Annual Meeting are: (1) To highlight recent advances in melanin structure and analysis, in the pigment cell response to light and other environmental stimuli, and in genome-level understanding of melanocyte function and transformation using relevant animal models and human tissue. (2) To bring together melanin chemists and photobiologists, pigment cell geneticists, and clinical scientists with strong interests in how abnormal melanocyte function contributes to benign and malignant disease in a way that will lead to advances in the science of photoprotection, fundamental genetics and developmental biology, health disparities in pigmentary disease such as vitiligo, and the determinants of melanocyte transformation. (3) To provide mentorship, in word and example, to young investigators who are developing careers in the fields of pigment cell chemistry and biology, with a specific focus on identifying and overcoming career barriers in these fields to women and underrepresented minorities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT / PROJECT NARRATIVE: The 2016 PASPCR Conference in Baltimore, Maryland will be organized by scientists and clinicians working predominantly within Maryland and the greater Washington DC area and will bring together investigators studying pigmentary disorders including pigmentary diseases disproportionately affecting persons of color, vitiligo, genetic pigmentation syndromes, and melanoma, as well as the fundamental biological and biochemical processes underlying those disease states. The theme of the conference is, “Seeing the Light: Pigment Cells, Their Responses, and the Generation of Diversity” and is relevant to public health as the conference will disseminate the latest findings as they relate to the etiology, treatment, and prevention of pigmentary disorders such as vitiligo and melanoma.

"Reducing Health Disparities in Internal Medicine with a focus on Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, HIV/AIDS, Pulmonology, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, and Nephrology subspecialty topics. Reducing Health Disparities in Internal Medicine The National Medical Association Internal Medicine Scientific Section would like to submit an application for consideration of R13 NIH Conference Support funding application for our upcoming 2016 Annual Convention & Scientific Assembly. We would like to include a comprehensive proposal that will focus on endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism, HIV/AIDS, gastroenterology, cardiology, and nephrology subspecialty topics—all topics of importance in minority populations. Our Convention will be held July 31 – August 4, 2016 in Los Angeles, CA. The current R13 application will focus on endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism, HIV/AIDS, pulmonology, gastroenterology, cardiology, and nephrology subspecialty topics. The proposed title would be NMA 2016 Reducing Health Disparities in Internal Medicine. Scientific sessions will explore strategies to reduce health disparities in Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, HIV/AIDS, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Pulmonology, and Nephrology in minority populations and the general populations at large. The session will also include early career investigators/trainees in our meeting to engage in networking, learn about the development of research tools and generate early awareness of health disparities. NMA Internal Medicine Section steering committee members and senior faculty will be available to serve as mentors to the early career investigators. This year we propose to have our selected award recipients present research poster presentations in the general session along with general NMA presenters. This is being proposed to expose our early career investigators to a broader medical and professional audience and to facilitate interaction with other NMA scientific section members, e.g., family medicine, emergency medicine, OB/GYN, etc., who may also have an interest in the presented science of our early career investigators. Additionally, new this year, we will integrate the top three recipients of the oral abstract presentations within the appropriate subspecialty IM session, e.g., Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, HIV/AIDS, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Pulmonology, and Nephrology. Our program will conclude with a round table discussion/small group question and answer session between the IM faculty/leaders and our early career investigators/research trainees. There are five objectives (specific aims) to this conference session: 1) Provide a forum for cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas to further explore issues of health  disparities in the areas of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, HIV/AIDS, Gastroenterology,  Cardiology, Pulmonology, and Nephrology. 2) Foster opportunities for early stage minority faculty and trainee investigators to network and learn  about current research in the internal medicine specialty including Endocrinology and  Metabolism, HIV/AIDS, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Pulmonology, and Nephrology. 3) Promote opportunities for early stage faculty and trainee investigators to their present research  findings during the general NMA poster presentation session; and integrate the top three  recipients of the oral abstract presentations within the appropriate Internal Medicine specialty presentations. 4) Promote opportunities for early stage faculty and trainee investigators to interact with more senior  investigators working in the internal medicine areas of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism,  HIV/AIDS, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Pulmonology, and Nephrology. 5) Provide a mentoring platform for early career minority investigators to engage in the NMA and  develop a pipeline of future leaders for the NMA. There is a need to educate physicians and young investigators about the current trends in the areas of internal medicine that impact minority populations as minorities often suffer disproportionate prevalence and incidence rates and negative outcomes. There is also a need to educate practicing physicians in the area of current subspecialty topics that are important to diverse populations of whom they serve. Significant disparities exist in the areas of endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism, HIV/AIDS, gastroenterology, cardiology, and nephrology.","Reducing Health Disparities in Internal Medicine with a focus on Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, HIV/AIDS, Pulmonology, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, and Nephrology subspecialty topics.",9195049,R13DK111177,"['abstracting ', ' Award ', ' Cardiology ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Endocrinology ', ' Faculty ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Future ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' Incidence ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephrology ', ' Physicians ', ' Pulmonary Medicine ', ' Pneumonology ', ' Pneumology ', ' Pulmonology ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' member ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Committee Members ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' trend ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' early awareness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench to clinic ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' learning network ', ' senior faculty ', ' full professor ', ' minority investigator ', ' ']",NIDDK,NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,R13,2016,46000,0.05591578444998414
"Integrated Care for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders: Making Research work to improve our health ABSTRACT The National Asian American Pacific Islander Mental Health Association (NAAPIMHA), the Asian American Center on Disparities Research (AACDR), and the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA) will develop a long range research agenda to address one of the most important health issues facing this country: the elimination of disparities in the quality of health and mental health care outcomes for some our most vulnerable populations that include refugee and immigrant and other underserved Asian American Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (AANHPIs). The conferences will also look at research that assesses the impact of mental health on the person’s overall health. NAAPIMHA, AACDR and the AAPA will develop a three year research conference agenda that assesses key aspects of culturally and linguistically appropriate models of integrated care . While each conference can stand on its own and will be applied for separately, developing a coordinated long term approach allows each conference to build on each other to add substantive information to the national dialogue to address AHRQ’s commitment to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care of underserved populations that includes Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. It is important to conduct this type of research as AANHPIs are either missing from research altogether or are identified as other or merely Asian American. This approach fails to accurately look at the unique and often challenging health problems faced by the target population and masks differences between subpopulations. This makes it difficult to ascertain the magnitude of the problems, the impact of historical trauma and mental health conditions on the person’s overall health. Findings from this research have important implication for development of culturally and linguistically appropriate care, development of policies, and redefining training efforts to improve the current workforce. The first-year conference will be held at New York University School of Medicine and will focus on current integrated care research. The conference will also identify gaps in research based on feedback from providers, consumers and community members. This will add to the dialogue of “What’s next” in improving research and will lay the foundation for selecting workshops for succeeding conferences. If funded, a second-year conference will be held at the University of California, Davis the location of the AACDR. It will continue to look at research on best practices and will provide opportunities for providers, researchers, students and community members from the West Coast to participate. The third -year will be held in Honolulu to focus on the unique needs of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations, who are among the most underserved. It will allow NHPIs to participate in a meaningful way that goes beyond the usual one or two individuals who might be presenting at a conference on the U.S. mainland. A summary report from each conference will be developed and disseminated through the partner networks and will be shared with AHRQ and other federal partners. Disseminating information to providers and end users of the research findings is an important part of the process. Each group plays an important role in providing input into the national dialogue to insure that research is culturally and linguistically appropriate and that findings will be used to develop policies and services to improve health care outcomes for underserved AANHPIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The National Asian American Pacific Islander Mental Health Association will partner with the Asian American Center on Disparities Research and the Asian American Psychological Association to develop a long range research agenda focusing on the health needs of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, including immigrant and refugees. The conference will be held in November, 2016 at New York University School of Medicine and will bring together researchers, community members, service providers, policy makers and other stakeholders. Presentations will look at the impact of trauma on the person’s overall health, integrated care in mental health vs primary care settings, use of traditional healing practices, systems issues and integrated care (training across disciplines, billing) and workforce development including use of paraprofessional community members. A summary report will be developed and disseminated through the partner networks and will be shared with AHRQ and other federal partners.","Integrated Care for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders: Making Research work to improve our health",9173442,R13HS024835,[''],AHRQ,NT'L ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER/MH,R13,2016,35000,0.035039711653185486
"Addressing Health Disparities and Promoting Health Equity in Psychosocial Oncology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Psychosocial Oncology Society (APOS) requests support for the next three annual conferences (2016-2018). APOS is dedicated to advancing the science and practice of psychosocial care for people affected by cancer and is the only multidisciplinary professional organization in the U.S. dedicated to the psychosocial aspects of cancer treatment. APOS' 454 members represent the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, nursing, social work, clergy, patient advocacy, and social and behavioral health scientists. This nation lacks sufficient providers and researchers with the requisite knowledge to implement recommendations and standards to achieve health equity in psychosocial cancer care. Therefore, APOS has prioritized health equity in the training and delivery of high quality cancer care, with a dedicated focus on implementation via this conference series.  The specific aims of our proposal are: 1) To educate practitioner and scientist attendees across disciplines about health disparities and promotion of health equity in psychosocial oncology; 2) To mentor 10 APOS scholars each year during the conference and throughout the subsequent years in research and practice; and 3) To educate 10 APOS Scholars from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds in the major content areas of the APOS core curriculum (principles of psychosocial oncology, psychosocial quality standards, psychosocial interventions for survivors and their families, health equity, psychosocial oncology programs). We will educate attendees through preconference workshops and 2-day conference programs that present leading-edge science and best practices to promote health equity for diverse populations who suffer health disparities due to racial, ethnic, gender, sexual preference, age or other characteristics. Conference planning will be by an inter-professional executive team and each conference will be evaluated to ensure we are meeting our objectives. We will award 10 APOS Scholar Awards each year over three years and will pair these Scholars with a senior practitioner or scientist. During the conference, mentors and mentees will meet and outline an education schedule for during the conference and a timeline to achieve their goals (e.g., proposal submission, changing practice,) outside the conference. We will use a systematic process to select and evaluate both Mentors and Scholars. Three specific impacts post Scholars Program are: (1) improved clinical practice, (2) improved networking with leaders in the field with established mentor-mentee relationships, and (3) increased research in psychosocial oncology to reduce health disparities and promote health equity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The American Psychosocial Oncology Society (APOS) is dedicated to advancing the science and practice of psychosocial care for people affected by cancer. APOS members recognize that there are many health disparities in cancer care due to racial, ethnic, gender, sexual preference, age or other characteristics. With a dedicated focus on training clinicians and scientists through a conference series, APOS will educate multidisciplinary providers and scientists and provide support for 10 junior clinicians and scientists each year. This will enable these clinicians and scientists to obtain the knowledge needed to improve 1) clinical practice, 2) networking with leaders in the field, and to 3) increase research in psychosocial oncology to reduce health disparities and promote health equity.            ",Addressing Health Disparities and Promoting Health Equity in Psychosocial Oncology,9052910,R13CA203346,"['Accreditation ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Budgets ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clergy ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Fees ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' intern ', ' Internships ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' oncology nursing ', ' Oncological Nursing ', ' Oncologic Nursing ', ' Patient advocacy ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' psychosocial service ', ' Psychiatric Social Service ', ' Psychiatric Social Work ', ' Social Workers ', ' Societies ', ' survivorship ', ' Translating ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Schedule ', ' TimeLine ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' Discipline ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' Oncology Nurse ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research in practice ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Scholars Program ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' ASCO ', ' American Society of Clinical Oncology ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' health equity ', ' oncology program ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN PSYCHOSOCIAL ONCOLOGY SOCIETY,R13,2016,10000,0.060283556441430505
"National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal for continued support of five yearly three-day stand-alone National Hispanic Science Network (NHSN) conferences. The NHSN is dedicated to improving health equity of Hispanics by increasing the amount, quality, and dissemination of interdisciplinary translational research; and fostering the development, advancement, and promotion of future Hispanic scientists and leaders. The NHSN conference will involve participation of members of the global research community focused on different aspects of alcohol and drug abuse including epidemiology, toxicology, environmental health, intervention science, psychology, sociology, health policy, and neurobiology as it pertains to Hispanic populations. The NHSN conference is unique in that it will congregate experts, who attend scientific conferences specific to their area of interest, and who otherwise would not have an opportunity to engage in this inter-professional and transdisciplinary scientific discourse. Because many of the socio cultural factors and co-morbid conditions relevant to Hispanic communities are shared with other underrepresented minority (URM) populations, we plan to expand the scope of the conference (on alternate years) to include African-American, Asian-American, Native-American workgroup participation. The proposed yearly conferences will continue to serve as the unique venue for transdisciplinary and inter-professional scientific discussions on strategies towards minimizing the impact of alcohol and drug abuse and their co-morbid conditions on health disparities in Hispanics and other URM. In addition, they will foster the recruitment, retention, development and advancement of Hispanic scientists to promote future leaders in areas related to alcohol and drug abuse research. This conference will provide an opportunity for trainees from diverse gender, ethnicity, discipline, and geographic locations to come together and participate in a multidisciplinary scientific meeting, establish peer-support groups, and develop professional relationships that will provide venues for innovative developments in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics constitute the largest racial/ethnic minority population in the United States and are disproportionately impacted by alcohol and drug abuse. There is a pressing need to study the biological, individual, family, community, legal, and contextual factors that differentially affect substance use, its consequences, and the use of treatment services in Hispanic populations through inter-disciplinary and translational approaches.

"Conference grant application to support the American Psychosomatic Society's 74th Annual Scientific Meeting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Providing strong support and guidance to promising pre- and post-doctoral students is crucial for the advancement of all fields of science. The overall goal of this competing renewal of R13 HL074923 is to provide travel support for trainees to attend and actively take part in the 74th Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society (APS) in Denver, Colorado (March 9 - 12, 2016). The essential mission of the APS is to promote and advance the scientific understanding of the interrelationships among biological, psychological, social and behavioral factors in human health and disease, and the integration of the fields of science that separately examine each, and to foster the application of this understanding in education and improved health care. This mission is instantiated in the selection of the theme for the 2016 meeting, ""Translating Research into Practice: From Bench to Policy,"" which will highlight empirical research, applied methodology, and clinical applications along the translational continuum. For greater than 7 decades, the annual APS meeting has provided an outstanding forum for trainees and established investigators and clinicians working within a wide range of disciplines and specialty areas to exchange new ideas and research strategies that ultimately facilitate and improve the quality of research and its translation into clinical practice and public policy. The annual APS meeting is attended by over 500 researchers and clinicians from around the world.         For the past 11 years, NHLBI has been the sponsoring institute for this award given that the annual scientific meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society is the only scientific conference focused on the bio-psycho- social determinants and consequences of cardiovascular disease, recognized world-wide as the field of cardiovascular behavioral medicine. Planned NHLBI-related programming for the 2016 meeting includes a keynote address by Dr. Dean Ornish, an invited symposium on neuroinflammation, and an invited symposium on behavioral interventions in health disparities populations. Policy issues related to Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine will be highlighted in a plenary session debate on empirical evidence related to the positive and negative health effects of cannabis use, which was first legalized in Colorado. Each of these topics builds on NHLBI themes and capitalizes on regional expertise across the translational spectrum. Regular presenters in Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine include luminaries such as Drs. Michael Irwin, Redford Williams, Margaret Chesney, Julian Thayer, Andrew Steptoe, Karen Matthews, Stephen Manuck, and Richard Lane. Increasingly, this conference has also highlighted relationships among sleep and health, with accepted abstracts focused on sleep increasing by 80% from 2003 to 2013. Support is also requested from other institutes (e.g., NCI, NCCAM) given the diversity of disciplines and specialties represented at this meeting.         There is no other comparable scientific meeting that overlaps with the content of the annual APS meeting, including its training opportunities. In this competing renewal, we propose to provide support for up to 10 Young Scholar Awards and 5 Minority Initiative Travel Awards. The Young Scholars Award Program will provide travel awards to competitively-selected trainees who submit a first-author abstract to present a paper or poster and who are judged to show outstanding potential for a career in psychosomatic and behavioral medicine. The APS Minority Initiative Travel Award will provide support for promising trainees from racial/ethnic or other underrepresented groups to attend the annual meeting. The process of identifying and selecting APS Minority Initiative Travel Award recipients will differ, as this award seeks to extend trainee award opportunities to individuals who are not yet ""stakeholders"" in the process.        Narrative: Providing strong support and guidance to promising pre- and post-doctoral students is crucial for the advancement of all fields of science.

"Ninth AACR Conference on The Science of Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed conference, titled “The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,” will be held from September 25-28, 2016 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This proposed conference will be the ninth in an AACR series focused specifically on the science of cancer health disparities. The first conference on The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved was held in 2007, then annually from 2009 - 2015. While most conferences on cancer health disparities focus on policy and public health issues, the goal of this conference is to incorporate perspectives from basic scientists and clinicians in conjunction with policy and public health. Transdisciplinary interactions between a variety of disciplines including basic science, clinical research, population science, behavioral research, and cancer survivorship, are needed to move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating disparities as they relate to cancer. Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer rates are well documented. While data suggest that access to quality care contributes to cancer disparities, other factors also play a major role, including tumor biology, genetics, hormonal status, lifestyle and behavior, screening policies, comorbidities, environmental exposure and risk, quality of and response to therapy, and post- therapeutic surveillance. The goal of this conference and the conference series is to bring together scientists and other professionals working in a variety of disciplines to discuss the latest findings in the field and to stimulate the development of new research in cancer health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer incidence and death statistics show that certain racial and ethnic groups in the United States suffer disproportionately from cancer and its associated effects. Although some disparities may be explained by socioeconomic factors, there is a biological basis as well. For example, research has identified differences in hormonal status and a number of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants that are more common among African Americans. Additionally, differences in inherited susceptibilities and molecular pathways for pathogenesis have been implicated as a source of prostate cancer disparities. This conference will bring together basic scientists, physicians, behavioral researchers, population researchers, and other health professionals to foster discussions and collaborations to move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating cancer health disparities.",Ninth AACR Conference on The Science of Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,9195485,R13CA210546,"['Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Research Technics ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Hormonal ', ' brca 2 gene ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 2 ', ' FANCD1 ', ' FANCB ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 2 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 2 Gene ', ' BRCA2 ', ' BRCA2 gene ', ' skills ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Population Sciences ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2016,74000,0.12862097976595518
"HBCU Climate Change Initiative: Growing HBCU Voices on Climate Change: The 4th Annual HBCU Climate Change Conference ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Dillard University Deep South Center for Environmental Justice will convene our 3rd Annual HBCU Student Conference 2015 Bridging the Gap between Climate Change Theory and Experience. The conference will be held on the campus of Dillard University, March 30 - April 3, 2015. While the fact of climate change is no longer subject to dispute, students at HBCUs need opportunities to engage with researchers and scientists about the expected impacts of climate change. Eleven major international studies conducted from 1987 to 2002 all predict significant climate change-induced hazards, including increased flooding, higher mean atmospheric temperatures, higher global mean sea levels, increased precipitation, increased droughts, increased atmospheric moisture-holding capacity, increased heat waves, increased strength of storms, more energetic waves, storm surges that reach further inland, under-capacity of urban sewerage and drainage systems, increased blight, increased vulnerability of port cities, and disproportionate impacts on disadvantaged population segments. HBCU students and faculty, many of whom are from disadvantaged communities, should be exposed to the impacts climate change could have in their communities and in other population segments. Our conference intends to offer such an experience. Our first objective is to educate HBCU students to become leaders and advocates for climate-impacted communities. Our second objective is to educate HBCU students on issues related to disproportionate exposure to toxins, health disparities, climate change and its impacts, climate justice, adaptation, community resilience, and other major climate change adaptation and mitigation topics. The conference will bring together students, Environmental Justice and coastal community residents impacted by toxic facilities and severe weather events related to climate change, in order to bridge the gap between theory and the experiential realities of climate change. Student participants will engage in the following activities at the conference:  Panels and plenaries led by experts in the field;  Tours/interactions with Gulf Coast communities currently impacted by climate change as well  as EJ communities living with toxins;  HBCU student panel presentations on climate change and EJ research projects utilizing TRI  data; and  HBCU student poster session highlighting the conduct of research projects and their findings Students are also introduced to the concept of Climate Justice which involves a complete understanding of how and why some communities are disproportionately impacted by climate change. In the context of this project, one must include a total examination of the African-American condition as it relates to toxic exposure and environmental health impacts. The interconnections between living near, toxic facilities and their contribution to the production of greenhouse gases (Co pollutants) is an important concept for students to understand within the construct of Climate Justice. Additionally, students are able to assess the increased health risks that African-Americans are exposed to by living near TRI facilities and living with the impacts of climate change.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    While the fact of climate change is no longer subject to dispute, students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) need opportunities to engage with researchers and scientists about the expected impacts of climate change. Most HBCUs are located in southern states - a vulnerable region impacted by hurricanes, drought, flooding, and other natural disasters. Climate-related disasters are increasing in the south more than other regions in the US.

"Recent Advances in AIDS and HIV Research Description (as provided by the applicant): Since 1998, the NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) have hosted an annual one day National CFAR Scientific Symposium in conjunction with the annual CFAR Directors'/Administrators' meeting. The purpose of the CFAR scientific symposium is to present, in a public forum, recent ""cutting edge"" advances in HIV/AIDS research for an average attendance of approximately 250-300. The intimate size of the meeting promotes opportunities for interactions between young and more senior investigators that would not be available at the larger annual scientific meetings related to HIV/AIDS. The meeting location rotates so that it is hosted each year by a different CFAR site. This provides geographic diversity for the venue and opportunities for a broader array of participants than for similar research symposia. As has been done for the past fifteen years, one of several AIDS-related research areas is the focus of the annual symposium. In 2011, the Duke University CFAR hosted the 15th Annual CFAR Research Symposium with focus on five scientific areas: ""Host-Viral Interactions during HIV Infection"", ""HIV-Associated Malignancies and Co-Infections"", ""Emerging Vaccine Strategies"", ""HIV/AIDS Health Disparities"", and ""Approaches to an HIV Cure"". Speakers were selected from the various NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research leadership, their scientific membership, and from nationally and internationally recognized research institutions. In addition to the participating CFAR Directors and invited leaders in the field, the remaining participants for the annual National CFAR Symposia are chosen based on specific criteria. First preference is given to young investigators who have received developmental funds from an NIH-funded CFAR program; second preference to young investigators with demonstrable potential in HIV/AIDS research; third preference is to other senior investigators engaged in HIV/AIDS research. In all cases women and individuals from underrepresented ethnic groups are encouraged to attend through targeted advertising and travel scholarships. Continuing Medical Education credits have been offered for attendees and access to web casts of the symposia are now available for interested investigators who are not able to attend. The purpose of the Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Symposium is to provide a venue to present and discuss recent advances in HIV/AIDS research. This is a unique forum for presentations of the most ""cutting edge"" research based on one of several AIDS-related topics. The symposium provides an environment that fosters interactions between senior HIV investigators and junior investigators that will one day be leaders in the field.",Recent Advances in AIDS and HIV Research,9115039,R13AI102630,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Advertising ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' continuing medical education ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Scholarship ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccines ', ' Woman ', ' Administrator ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' co-infection ', ' coinfection ', ' HIV/TB ', ' HIV/Mtb ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R13,2016,15000,0.0491978041714797

"Time Use Across the Life Course: Multigenerational Family Health and Well-Being Project Summary This proposal requests five years of support for two biennial conferences on intersections of time use, family inequality, and well-being. The proposal builds on the 10 year history of successful time use conferences sponsored by the Maryland Population Research Center and co-organized by faculty from the Departments of Sociology and Economics and the School of Public Health. The aims of the proposal are to 1) offer a forum for dialogue among senior and new time use, public health, and social and social and behavioral science scholars on innovative research on time use and child and family well-being across diverse families; 2) Identify emerging issues in how life course variation in time use patterns is linked with developmental and role transitions and adult and family well-being, emphasizing differences by gender, race-ethnicity, and education; 3) Foster interdisciplinary and international research teams who will develop pioneering projects on emerging issues identified in Aim 2; and 4) Facilitate translational research projects that apply knowledge about how time use variation across the life course and by gender, parenthood, race-ethnicity, and education influences well- being to identify ways to improve effectiveness and scope of related programs and policies. To address these aims, the proposed three biennial conferences are designed to provide a forum for dialogue about integrating time use data with cross-disciplinary perspectives and tools on life course research and provide opportunities for the formation of new interdisciplinary teams and increasing the number of scholars from underrepresented groups applying time use data to emerging time-use-related social issues. Relevance Changes in family structure, living arrangements and population aging are altering life course work and family trajectories, time transfers up and down the generational ladder, and social integration. Time diary surveys provide reliable, detailed, and comparable data on how family and social change influence children and adult’s social integration, economic participation and health-related behaviors (e.g. eating, sleep, leisure). Time diary data can be used to examine how work and leisure activities are associated with stress and enjoyment, as well as the formation of cognitive, physical, economic, and social capital and, with GPS integration, daily exposure to environmental stressors like pollution, high-crime areas, and food deserts.",Time Use Across the Life Course: Multigenerational Family Health and Well-Being,9330988,R13HD088085,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Crime ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' financial assistance ', ' Financial Support ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Institutes ', ' Leisure Activities ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Maryland ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Sociology ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Leisures ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Employment Status ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' environmental stressor ', ' social integration ', ' intergenerational ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' family structure ', ' social ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Cognitive ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R13,2017,500,0.042238020967905215
"Improving Health Disparities by Building an Equitable Future for Communities through Research and Practice The current R13 application will focus on diabetes, obesity, gastroenterology, cardiology, pulmonology, and nephrology subspecialty topics. The proposed title will be NMA 2017 Improving Health Disparities by Building an Equitable Future for Communities through Research and Practice. Scientific sessions will explore strategies to reduce health disparities in minority populations and the general populations at large. We will include early career investigators in our meeting to engage in networking, learn about the development of research tools, and generate early awareness of health disparities. Our selected award recipients will present research poster presentations in the general session along with general NMA presenters, as well as our R13 poster session. The highest scored abstracts will be invited to present their research in the form of a brief oral presentation. We also propose to invite the early career researchers to our Endo-Diabetes Session/IM Section Awards Dinner where they will have the unique opportunity to celebrate and network with IM Section members who have made significant contributions to the area of IM and to the careers of young investigators. We will conclude with small group discussions between awardees and senior faculty. There are four objectives to this conference session: 1) Provide a forum for cross- disciplinary exchange of ideas to further explore issues of health disparities in the areas of Diabetes, Obesity, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Pulmonology, and Nephrology. 2) Foster opportunities for early stage minority faculty and trainees to network and learn about current research in the internal medicine specialty including, Diabetes, Obesity, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Pulmonology, and Nephrology. 3) Promote opportunities for early stage faculty and trainees to present their research findings during the general NMA poster presentation session; and integrate the top recipients of the abstract submissions as oral abstract presentations within the appropriate Internal Medicine specialty presentations; and 4) Promote opportunities for early stage faculty and trainee investigators to interact with more senior investigators working in the internal medicine specialties to enable them the opportunity to establish professional relationships that will provide early career guidance and for those interested “groom” them for future leadership in the NMA. These objectives are consistent with the mission of NIDDK in translating research findings from the bench to the bedside that will further impact health care outcomes in underserved populations. There is a need to educate physicians and young investigators about the current trends in the areas of internal medicine that impact minority populations as minorities often suffer disproportionate prevalence and incidence rates and negative outcomes. There is also a need to educate practicing physicians in the area of current subspecialty topics that are important to diverse populations of whom they serve.

"National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal for continued support of five yearly three-day stand-alone National Hispanic Science Network (NHSN) conferences. The NHSN is dedicated to improving health equity of Hispanics by increasing the amount, quality, and dissemination of interdisciplinary translational research; and fostering the development, advancement, and promotion of future Hispanic scientists and leaders. The NHSN conference will involve participation of members of the global research community focused on different aspects of alcohol and drug abuse including epidemiology, toxicology, environmental health, intervention science, psychology, sociology, health policy, and neurobiology as it pertains to Hispanic populations. The NHSN conference is unique in that it will congregate experts, who attend scientific conferences specific to their area of interest, and who otherwise would not have an opportunity to engage in this inter-professional and transdisciplinary scientific discourse. Because many of the socio cultural factors and co-morbid conditions relevant to Hispanic communities are shared with other underrepresented minority (URM) populations, we plan to expand the scope of the conference (on alternate years) to include African-American, Asian-American, Native-American workgroup participation. The proposed yearly conferences will continue to serve as the unique venue for transdisciplinary and inter-professional scientific discussions on strategies towards minimizing the impact of alcohol and drug abuse and their co-morbid conditions on health disparities in Hispanics and other URM. In addition, they will foster the recruitment, retention, development and advancement of Hispanic scientists to promote future leaders in areas related to alcohol and drug abuse research. This conference will provide an opportunity for trainees from diverse gender, ethnicity, discipline, and geographic locations to come together and participate in a multidisciplinary scientific meeting, establish peer-support groups, and develop professional relationships that will provide venues for innovative developments in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics constitute the largest racial/ethnic minority population in the United States and are disproportionately impacted by alcohol and drug abuse. There is a pressing need to study the biological, individual, family, community, legal, and contextual factors that differentially affect substance use, its consequences, and the use of treatment services in Hispanic populations through inter-disciplinary and translational approaches.

"2017 International Conference on Stigma 1 Project Summary/Abstract  2 Background: HIV continues to spread at alarming rates and a great number of people living with HIV and  3 AIDS are not engaged in care, with significant racial disparities in outcomes. Despite advances in treatment  4 and other interventions, rates of new HIV infections in the US remain high. We believe that shame and stigma  5 of HIV contribute significantly to these poor outcomes. Attitudes towards those with HIV and other stigmatized  6 conditions have not changed much. It is essential to promote empirical research and theory building for  7 stigma that would have both basic and applied scientific significance, including implications for policymakers  8 and opinion leaders. There is need to develop and evaluate interventions that are tailored to reduce stigma  9 particularly in communities of color. Also, it is critical to mentor junior minority researchers involved in stigma 10 research. The overarching goal is to decrease HIV and other health-related stigma, and improve health 11 outcomes. The main goal of this proposal is to strengthen research capacity, particularly in junior minority 12 researchers in the field of stigma, and to foster research-community partnerships. Methods: The proposed 13 International Conference on Stigma will be the eighth held since 2010 and will take place on November 17, 14 2017 at Howard University. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers, community leaders, 15 policy makers, academia, students, and affected individuals with emphasis on inclusion of racial and gender 16 minorities and women. Howard University and its partners have an established structure of committees and 17 volunteers to orchestrate this event.

"Illuminating Actionable Biology in TNBC Abstract The focus of this proposal is to host a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-focused scientific conference entitled “1st International TNBC Conference: Illuminating Actionable Biology in TNBC” to a diverse, international audience on Sept. 25-26, 2017, in Atlanta, GA. The broad, long-term objective of the proposed conference is to help realize the promises of precision medicine for TNBC patients, for whom there are still no approved targeted drugs or prognostic assays. As a result, a diagnosis of TNBC confers a bleak prognosis that contrasts starkly with that of non-TNBC patients, for whom advances in precision medicine have revolutionized clinical care. In addition, African American (AA) breast cancer patients have an increased risk of poor clinical outcomes, such as metastasis and death, compared with European American (EA) patients, because: (a) AA women have a 2-3-fold greater likelihood of developing TNBC and (b) even among TNBC patients, AAs experience a more aggressive disease course than EAs. Thus, the biology of TNBC differs fundamentally between AAs and EAs, leading to a glaring racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes. Progress in TNBC research has thus stagnated because of the overwhelming complexity, inter-patient and intratumor heterogeneity of this disease. To deconvolve this complexity, it is necessary for a diversity of TNBC investigators across the globe, with their unique perspectives, distinct areas of expertise, and complementary resources, to join together to identify and validate actionable TNBC biology, which if exploited, can transform clinical care for TNBC patients. However, at present, there are limited opportunities for TNBC investigators to meet one another because TNBC-focused conferences are exceedingly rare. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for an international scientific conference exclusively dedicated to TNBC research, which we propose to fill through three specific aims: Aim 1: To present the latest research on actionable biology in TNBC from leaders in the field to a diverse, international audience. Talks will be given on topics related to actionable biology in TNBC (biology of TNBC, big data analysis, health disparities, prognostic/predictive biomarkers, novel drug targets, and treatment strategies), with the keynote address delivered by Prof. Ian Ellis of the University of Nottingham. Registration will be capped at 250. Travel awards and waived registration will be provided to meritorious applicants from groups underrepresented in the life sciences, and measures will be taken to assist attendees with childcare needs. Aim 2: To provide a forum for labs across the world to present their latest research findings on TNBC in a poster session. Up to 50 abstracts will be accepted and presentations will be judged by an esteemed panel of researchers. Aim 3: To host an engaging, innovative and participant-led “Talk It and Chalk It” brainstorming session to generate new research ideas. The impact of successful completion of these aims will be to disseminate cutting-edge research findings about actionable biology in TNBC to diverse researchers from around the world and to stimulate collaborative TNBC research that can advance precision medicine for the TNBC patients. Project Narrative The proposed conference, “1st International TNBC Conference: Illuminating Actionable Biology in TNBC,” would advance research on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by informing a diverse, international audience of scientific researchers of the latest findings on actionable TNBC biology and promoting collaborative research projects. Scientific conferences dedicated exclusively to TNBC are rare, so there are limited opportunities for TNBC researchers to become informed of groundbreaking findings prior to publication and to meet one another to form the synergistic collaborations that are necessary to tackle the complexity of the disease. This project would fill this unmet need and thereby help to usher in an era of precision medicine for TNBC patients, as has transformed clinical care for patients with other breast cancer subtypes.",Illuminating Actionable Biology in TNBC,9332028,R13MD011558,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' lymph nodes ', ' lymph gland ', ' Lymph node proper ', ' Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Chalk ', ' prognostic ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Fostering ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Glare ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cytotoxic agent ', ' Cytotoxic drug ', ' Knowledge ', ' posters ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Distant Metastasis ', ' Distant Cancer ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' International ', ' Systemic Therapy ', ' SYS-TX ', ' ASCO ', ' American Society of Clinical Oncology ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' TNBC ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' clinical care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' prognostic tool ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' cancer markers ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' molecular subsets ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' prognostic assays ', ' prognostic test ', ' ']",NIMHD,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R13,2017,50000,-0.023857085127264692
"From Bench to Clinic: How Basic, Translational, and Clinical Research in Conjunction with Focused Outreach Continues to be Transformative Abstract The Americas Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders (AASOG) is a physician and physician-scientist directed organization that is dedicated to a better understanding of the pathogenesis and improving treatment of patients with sarcoidosis. This poorly understood disease commonly afflicts underrepresented minorities. AASOG is a subsidiary of the World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders (WASOG), which is based in Europe and was founded in 1987. AASOG has previously sponsored 7 annual national meetings. I addition to general subjects related to genetics, biomarkers and treatment for sarcoidosis, this 8th annual conference will focus on 2 specific areas: 1) How better to provide access to minority communities for Sarcoidosis treatment 2) A detailed discussion of neurosarcoidosis, with special considerations on fatigue, the most common symptom in sarcoidosis and its affect on quality of life. Conference Title: Combining Transformative Sarcoidosis Research and Outreach to Improve Health Disparities With this framework in mind, many of the invited participants are underrepresented minorities, and many of the attendees are junior faculty or trainees. The focus on underrepresented minorities expands beyond the invited participants in that the low registration fees will make this meeting highly accessible to underrepresented minorities. Trainee participation in the meeting will be further encouraged by waiving registration fees and providing travel awards to 5 students/junior investigators based upon the quality of their research presentations. Furthermore, the highly interactive scientific environment and engagement with well-established research scientists will be contributory to their career development. This meeting will thereby encourage and promote the development of new scientists dedicated to the advancement of sarcoidosis research and treatment and encourage further collaboration among researchers to advance our knowledge of sarcoidosis. Thus, the 2017 AASOG meeting will support a variety of activities that are directly relevant to the scientific missions of the National Institutes of Health and public health. Project Narrative Sarcoidosis is an immune mediated disease of unknown cause that can affect multiple organs in an Individual. Although sarcoidosis can occur in any racial/ethnic group, it is often most severe in African Americans and especially African-American women. The AASOG annual conference is an event that lets physician, physician-scientists and basic scientist with an interest in sarcoidosis to get together and discuss clinical and research aspects of this disease. . I addition to general subjects related to genetics, biomarkers and treatment for sarcoidosis, this 8th (2017) annual conference will focus on 2 specific areas: 1) How better to provide access to minority communities for Sarcoidosis treatment 2) A detailed discussion of neurosarcoidosis, with special considerations on fatigue, the most common symptom in sarcoidosis, and its affect on quality of life.","From Bench to Clinic: How Basic, Translational, and Clinical Research in Conjunction with Focused Outreach Continues to be Transformative",9332024,R13HL137361,"['Affect ', ' Americas ', ' Award ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Europe ', ' Faculty ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Fees ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sarcoidosis ', "" Schaumann's Disease "", "" Boeck's Sarcoid "", ' Besnier-Boeck Disease ', ' Students ', ' Translating ', ' Travel ', ' Angiitis ', ' Vasculitis ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Granulomatous ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' care delivery ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' career development ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Mind ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench to clinic ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' neurosarcoidosis ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' common symptom ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R13,2017,15000,0.0878653485080238
"Conference grant application to support American Psychosomatic Society's 75th Annual Scientific Meeting Providing strong support and guidance to promising pre- and post-doctoral students is crucial for the advancement of all fields of science. The overall goal of this NIA-supported R13 is to provide travel support for trainees to attend and actively take part in the 75th Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society (APS) in Seville, Spain (March 15-18, 2017). The essential mission of the APS is to promote and advance the scientific understanding of the interrelationships among biological, psychological, social and behavioral factors in human health and disease, and the integration of the fields of science that separately examine each, and to foster the application of this understanding in education and improved health care. This mission is instantiated in the selection of the theme for the 2017 meeting, “Mobilizing Technology to Advance Biobehavioral Science and Health,” which will highlight empirical research, applied methodology, and clinical applications along the translational continuum, with an emphasis on dissemination and public policy. For greater than 7 decades, the annual APS meeting has provided an outstanding forum for trainees and established investigators and clinicians working within a wide range of disciplines and specialty areas to exchange new ideas and research strategies that ultimately facilitate and improve the quality of research and its translation into clinical practice and public policy. The annual APS meeting is attended by over 500 researchers and clinicians from around the world. Previously supported by NHLBI for 12 years (R13 HL074923), APS has obtained the support of NIA for the 75th anniversary meeting to broaden its emphasis on research and training in biological, psychosocial, and behavioral mechanisms of health and disease across the lifespan. In fact, the thematic undercurrent of much of the research and training opportunities offered at the meeting reflect mechanisms of accelerated aging and their effect modifiers including indices of resilience and vulnerability. Planned NIA-related programming for the 2017 meeting includes a keynote address by Sir Michael Marmot, an invited symposium on mobile technology in health care and research, emphasizing diseases of aging, and an invited symposium on Hispanic health across the lifespan. Regular presenters who highlight a lifespan approach to psychosomatic medicine research and have been NIA grantees include luminaries such as Drs. Michael Irwin, Redford Williams, Andrew Steptoe, Karen Matthews, Elissa Epel, Julian Thayer, and Stephen Manuck. Increasingly, this conference has also highlighted sleep health in relation to aging including allostatic load, cellular and molecular indices of aging, cellular senescence, and diseases of aging. Secondary support is also requested from other institutes (e.g., NCI, NHLBI, NCCIH) given the diversity of disciplines and specialties represented at this meeting. For example, the Hispanic health symposium will include presentations relevant to cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes. Confirmed speakers for the Hispanic health symposium are rising stars in disparities research across the lifespan including Drs. Shakir Suglia, Carmela Alcantara, and Frank Penedo; notably, each of these individuals is also from an underrepresented minority. We will also sponsor an invited symposium and roundtable luncheon that addresses new guidelines for statistical significance and replication. Confirmed speakers include Dr. Jessica Utts, President of the American Statistical Association and Chair of the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Irvine, Dr. Meredith Wallace, Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, Daniel Lakens, of the Human-Technology Interaction at the Eidenhoven University of Technology. The symposium will include a moderated discussion with the speakers, journal representatives, and interactive discussion with the audience, facilitated by Sli.Do technology. There is no other comparable scientific meeting that overlaps with the content of the annual APS meeting, including its training opportunities. In this application, we propose to provide support for up to 10 Young Scholar Awards and 3 Minority Initiative Travel Awards. The Young Scholars Award Program will provide travel awards to competitively-selected trainees who submit a first-author abstract to present a paper or poster and who are judged to show outstanding potential for a career in psychosomatic and behavioral medicine. The APS Minority Initiative Travel Award will provide support for promising trainees from racial/ethnic or other underrepresented groups to attend the annual meeting. The process of identifying and selecting APS Minority Initiative Travel Award recipients will differ, as this award seeks to extend trainee award opportunities to individuals who are not yet “stakeholders” in the process. Providing strong support and guidance to promising pre- and post-doctoral students is crucial for the advancement of all fields of science. This grant request proposes to provide travel support for up to 13 trainees to attend the 75th Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society (APS).",Conference grant application to support American Psychosomatic Society's 75th Annual Scientific Meeting,9331871,R13AG056137,"['Aging ', ' Anniversary ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cardiology ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Consultations ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Institutes ', ' Interest Group ', ' Learning ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Marmota ', ' Marmots ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Neuroendocrinology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Paper ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychoneuroimmunology ', ' psychoneuroimmunological ', ' Psychophysiologic Disorders ', ' psychosomatic ', ' Psychosomatic Disorders ', ' Psychosomatic Diseases ', ' Psychophysiological Disorders ', ' Psychophysiological Diseases ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychosomatic Medicine ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Societies ', ' Spain ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Translations ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Immunology ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' Guidelines ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nature ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' American ', ' success ', ' professor ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' social ', ' career development ', ' Address ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Mind-Body Intervention ', ' mind body wellness ', ' mind body treatments ', ' mind body therapy ', ' mind body techniques ', ' mind body medicine skills ', ' mind body approach ', ' Mind-Body Medicine ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Research Training ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' allostatic load ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' doctoral student ', ' training opportunity ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Department chair ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' ']",NIA,AMERICAN PSYCHOSOMATIC SOCIETY (APS),R13,2017,29050,0.045866923624885286
"Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research Annual Conference Abstract  The Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research (ABMR) was founded in 1978 at a meeting organized by representatives of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. Its mission is to promote the highest values in behavioral medicine research, stimulate integration of biomedical and behavioral disciplines, foster scientific integrity, promote research with high potential for improving public health, and support diversity of ideas, disciplines, and scientific representation within the field of behavioral medicine. The objectives of ABMR's annual meetings have been to provide a forum for established scientists and thought leaders working in the field to share cutting-edge ideas to be exchanged in an informal, yet scientifically- charged atmosphere. The criteria for membership in ABMR are high levels of productivity, excellence and broad recognition for their accomplishments. The annual meetings provide a unique opportunity for well-established scientists to learn about the most recent research in the field, to identify important emerging trends in behavioral medicine, and to help guide national research priorities and policy strategies for improving our national public health mission.  ABMR's 39th annual meeting will take place on Jun 21-24, 2017 at La Fonda on the Plaza, Santa Fe, NM. The theme of the meeting is Transdiagnostic Risk Mechanisms: Accelerating the Impact of Behavioral Medicine. The overarching purpose of the meeting is to enrich traditional disease-based models of research and practice by focus on risk pathways and behavioral treatment modalities common to multiple chronic diseases, especially as applied to cancer, inflammation, and psychoneuroimmunology. Symposia are designed to promote cross- fertilization and break disease-based silos through organization by transdiagnostic risk factors, with cancer research results integrated within symposia with findings from other diseases that share common risk pathways with cancer. For example, biobehavioral research from multiple chronic disease perspectives can inform cancer research on factors related to exposure to tobacco and other carcinogens, diet and obesity, adherence to screening recommendations, tumor neuroendocrine microenvironment, angiogenesis, factors controlling metastatic pathways, and the patient response to diagnosis and treatment. Support for this conference will help ABMR provide leadership and guidance for the national research agenda in behavioral medicine to improve outcomes for cancer and other chronic, lifestyle-associated diseases with high mortality rates. Project Narrative  The Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research (ABMR) is one of the leading organizations of senior scientists dedicated to supporting and refining the national research agenda in biobehavioral medical and related sciences, and to providing guidance for policy development to facilitate the national public health mission. Its membership includes established investigators and thought leaders doing research relevant to cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, infectious diseases, and other significant killers in the U.S. ABMR's upcoming annual meeting will provide opportunities for leading scientists to exchange cutting-edge ideas in an informal, yet scientifically-charged atmosphere to inform and guide our national public health research mission, with special emphasis on transdiagnostic mechanisms pertinent to cancer and other chronic diseases with high mortality rates in the US.",Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research Annual Conference,9329808,R13CA216984,"['Academy ', ' Angiogenesis Factor ', ' Angiogenic Factor ', ' Arousal ', ' earth atmosphere ', ' Atmosphere ', ' planetary Atmosphere ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Charge ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Fertility/Fertilization ', ' Fertilization ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Academy of Sciences ', ' National Academy of Sciences ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Productivity ', ' Psychoneuroimmunology ', ' psychoneuroimmunological ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Stress ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Glean ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Neuroendocrine Neoplasm ', ' Neuroendocrine Tumors ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' tertiary prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Adherence ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' trend ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' risk sharing ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment strategy ', ' public health research ', ' screening ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",NCI,CLEMSON UNIVERSITY,R13,2017,15580,0.0659377011770429
"2017 Neuroethology: Behavior, Evolution and Neurobiology Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary: Funds are requested to support the 8th Gordon Research Conference (GRC) in Neuroethology, to be held June 18th –June 23rd, 2015 at the Les Diablerets Conference Center Les Diablerets, Switzerland. The GRC will be preceded by a two day Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) organized by two postdoctoral fellows, with support from mentors that are leaders in the field. The GRS is designed for graduate students and postdocs to discuss their current research and to network with their peers. Almost all GRS attendees with also attend the GRC. The quest to understand the biological principles that exquisitely adapt organisms to their environments and which allow them to solve complex problems, has led to unexpected insights into how similar problems can be solved and are central to the BRAIN initiative. Recent cutting-edge advances in neuroethological research are revealing how animals sense their constantly changing environments and use this information neurally to control and generate complex behaviors, like locomotion and language. The 2017 GRC – whose title is The Behavioral, Neural and Evolutionary Strategies for Animal Survival – aims to take a multidisciplinary approach to discuss how animals have evolved convergent solutions to a wide range of problems. The neural solutions, including the underlying circuits and genes, are most readily studied in animals that have exaggerated a particular sensory system or evolved an elaborate behavioral repertoire as an adaptation to a specific, naturally occurring niche. These adaptions are usually formed in response to the fight for survival. For example, work on the specialized system in owls for finding prey has led to a general understanding of the auditory coding process, multisensory processing, and adult brain, work on conopeptides which are used by cone snails to catch prey has led to development of a new drug to treat chronic pain, and work on echolocating bats has led to new devices to aid hearing impaired humans. Speaker topics for this conference fall broadly into four main themes which examine: 1) The neural circuits underlying complex behaviors, including locomotion, and how the animal’s environment can alter circuits; 2) The neural circuits underlying communication signals and language; 3) The response to pain by looking at the use of and adaptation to identified toxins; 4) The use of neurogenetics to probe known circuits underlying complex behaviors. Discussion within each of these themes will generate important information about the basic function of the nervous system and could lead to future drugs for pain and devices to help alleviate neural dysfunction. Project Narrative: The theme of this conference is to examine the neural circuits underlying some of the amazing behaviors some animals have developed over time as they fight for survival. Funding for conference participants will enable students, postdocs and more junior scientists and engineers to network directly, and develop new collaborations that will impact future rehabilitative treatments for human locomotion, navigation, sensation, pain management, and brain and spinal cord dysfunctions. The central theme of the meeting is in accordance with the BRAIN initiative; to develop novel neural recording devices and define neural circuits as they operate naturally to generate adaptive behavior.","2017 Neuroethology: Behavior, Evolution and Neurobiology Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar",9398725,R13NS103535,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Bats ', ' Chiroptera ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Evolution ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Locomotion ', ' Mentors ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Snails ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Students ', ' Switzerland ', ' Time ', ' Toxin ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Schedule ', ' Amaze ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' career ', ' Friendships ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Strigiformes ', ' Owls ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' fighting ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' neurogenetics ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuroprosthesis ', ' neuroprosthetic ', ' neuro-prosthetic ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' sensory system ', ' Devices ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' multisensory ', ' Cone ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' neuroethology ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' gender disparity ', ' ']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2017,10000,-0.03470769538745101

"The 5th Annual HBCU Climate Change Conference 2017 Project Summary/Abstract The Dillard University Deep South Center for Environmental Justice will partner with the Barbara Jordan-Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University, in collaboration with twenty-five (25) Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and fifteen (15) community-based organizations to host the 5th Annual HBCU Climate Change Conference. The conference, to take place from March 29, 2017 through April 2, 2017, will focus on the disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable and marginalized communities. Conference sessions will address racial, social, public health and economic disparities in the wake of climate related disasters, serving as a call to action for students at HBCU’s to become engaged in the conversation around climate change and climate justice. While the fact of climate change is no longer subject to dispute, students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) need opportunities to engage with researchers and scientists about the expected impacts of climate change. Eleven major international studies conducted from 1987 to 2002 all predict significant climate change-induced hazards, including increased flooding, higher mean atmospheric temperatures, higher global mean sea levels, increased precipitation, increased droughts, increased atmospheric moisture-holding capacity, increased heat waves, increased strength of storms, more energetic waves, storm surges that reach further inland, under-capacity of urban sewerage and drainage systems, increased blight, increased vulnerability of port cities, and disproportionate impacts on disadvantaged population segments. HBCU students and faculty, many of whom are from disadvantaged communities, should be exposed to the impacts climate change could have in their communities and in other population segments. Our conference intends to offer such an experience The major purpose of the conference is to (1) introduce HBCU students to climate change science, (2) engage students with Gulf Coastal communities experiencing the impacts of climate change, (3) engage students in the practice of the profession through the presentation of research findings and (4) interact with and learn from professional experts in the field. The conference also strives to create synergy between academia and vulnerable communities. This synergy is expected to be achieved through the delivery of scholarly papers and presentations based on research conducted by students, faculty, scientific researchers and other environmental professionals using data, research findings, and scientific approaches to improve the environment and/or the health and well-being of climate impacted communities in coastal regions and harbor cities. In particular, the connections established through this conference are expected to contribute to addressing chronic or emerging challenges related to climate change in coastal regions or harbor cities that can be exacerbated by offshore oil and gas operations or natural disasters. Additionally, we expect to promote cross-boundary connections and activities that extend the HBCU consortium’s existing programming to new stakeholder communities in order to foster the development of leadership and communication skills, competencies in science literacy, and capabilities such as effective collaborations, partnerships and actions involving local and global-level climate change mitigation efforts. The aim of the proposed conference is to bring together HBCU faculty and students, researchers, climate professionals and environmental justice and coastal community residents impacted by toxic facilities and severe weather events related to climate change, in order to bridge the gap between theory and the experiential realities of climate change. To that end, conference participants will engage in the following activities during this 4 day event: (1) Panels and plenary sessions led by experts in the field; (2) Presentations, tours and interactions with Gulf Coast communities currently impacted by climate change and environmental justice communities living with toxins; (3) HBCU student panel presentations of climate change and environmental justice research projects; (4) HBCU student poster session highlighting the conduct of research projects and their findings presented to local high school students and others attending the conference. Through this conference, we expect to promote cross-boundary connections and activities that extend the HBCU consortium’s existing programming to new stakeholder communities in order to foster the development of leadership and communication skills, competencies in science literacy, and capabilities such as effective collaborations, partnerships and policy actions involving local and global-level climate change mitigation efforts in an effort to improve the public health. Project Narrative: The connections established through this conference are expected to contribute to addressing chronic or emerging challenges in environmental justice communities in coastal regions or harbor cities that are related to climate change which can be exacerbated by offshore oil and gas operations or natural disasters affecting the physical health of community residents. Additionally, we expect to promote cross-boundary connections and activities that extend the HBCU consortium’s existing programming to new stakeholder communities in order to foster the development of leadership and communication skills, competencies in science literacy, and capabilities such as effective collaboration and relationship building resulting in local initiatives to improve health and well-being while decreasing risks to the health and safety of community residents. Ultimately, as a result of these connections, community leaders will work with students on these initiatives with the major goal of developing policy action plans to address community identified public health concerns.",The 5th Annual HBCU Climate Change Conference 2017,9336632,R13ES028123,"['Affect ', ' Cities ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disasters ', ' Drainage ', ' Drainage procedure ', ' Droughts ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Flooding ', ' Floods ', ' Gases ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Jordan ', ' Justice ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Oils ', ' Paper ', ' Precipitation ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Sea ', ' Students ', ' Temperature ', ' Texas ', ' Toxin ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Competence ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' posters ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' experience ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' hazard ', ' synergism ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Disputes ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Community Health ', ' health economics ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' community living ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' Heat Waves ', ' severe weather ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' community safety ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' gulf coast ', ' environmental justice ', ' operation ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' climate impact ', ' leadership development ', ' Relationship-Building ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' ']",NIEHS,DILLARD UNIVERSITY,R13,2017,8000,0.1331561034363736

"Tenth AACR Conference on The Science of Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed conference, titled “The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,” will be held from September 25-28, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia. This proposed conference will be the tenth in an AACR series focused specifically on the science of cancer health disparities. The first conference on The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved was held in 2007, then annually from 2009 - 2016. While most conferences on cancer health disparities focus on policy and public health issues, the goal of this conference is to incorporate perspectives from basic scientists and clinicians in conjunction with policy and public health. Transdisciplinary interactions between a variety of disciplines including basic science, clinical research, population science, behavioral research, and cancer survivorship, are needed to move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating disparities as they relate to cancer. Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer rates are well documented. While data suggest that access to quality care contributes to cancer disparities, other factors also play a major role, including tumor biology, genetics, hormonal status, lifestyle and behavior, screening policies, comorbidities, environmental exposure and risk, quality of and response to therapy, and post- therapeutic surveillance. The goal of this conference and the conference series is to bring together scientists and other professionals working in a variety of disciplines to discuss the latest findings in the field and to stimulate the development of new research in cancer health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer incidence and death statistics show that certain racial and ethnic groups in the United States suffer disproportionately from cancer and its associated effects. In addition to disparities which may be explained by socioeconomic and cultural factors, there is a biological basis as well. For example, differences in hormonal status and a number of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants are more common among African Americans. Additionally, differences in inherited susceptibilities and molecular pathways for pathogenesis have been implicated as a source of prostate cancer disparities. This conference will bring together basic scientists, physicians, behavioral researchers, population researchers, and other health professionals to foster discussions and collaborations to move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating cancer health disparities.",Tenth AACR Conference on The Science of Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,9398597,R13CA221309,"['Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Hormonal ', ' BRCA2 gene ', ' brca 2 gene ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 2 ', ' FANCD1 ', ' FANCB ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 2 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 2 Gene ', ' BRCA2 ', ' skills ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Population Sciences ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Science ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Molecular ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2017,66000,0.1291720841784823
"Advancing the Science of Community Engaged Research PROJECT SUMMARY To address an urgent need to advance the field of community engaged research, faculty at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Meharry Medical College will organize a series of national meetings on “Advancing the Science of Community Engaged Research”. These meetings will bring together a diverse group of stakeholders to share community engaged research evidence and practical knowledge for implementing new and enhancing existing research programs. The goals are: 1) to expand the scientific basis for the community engaged research field by convening a diverse stakeholder group including researchers, community partners, patient advocacy organizations, and others to share innovative methods and strategies; 2) to engage community representatives and patient advocates in the development of new approaches in community engaged research by meaningfully involving them in the planning, as speakers and presenters, and as participants of the national conferences; 3) to catalyze innovative community engaged research using interactive meeting methods that promote learning, support collective problem solving, and encourage new conceptual frameworks; and 4) to enhance the reach and impact of the scientific developments emerging from the conferences by disseminating conference proceedings, toolkits, priority action items and other products to a broad and varied audience. Funding is sought to support the engagement of diverse stakeholder groups including racial and ethnic minorities, community and patient representatives, and junior investigators. Funding would also support the broader dissemination of the scientific developments from the conferences. This support is critical to advancing community engagement across the translational spectrum.

"Hampton University’s First Annual Caribbean Health Conference – Addressing Inequities One Step at a Time Abstract Hampton University’s First Annual Caribbean Health Conference – Addressing Inequities One Step at a Time will seek to address the large health inequities that exist within Caribbean populations residing in Caribbean Nations and U.S. territories. Surprisingly, few studies have examined the effect of social factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, geographic location or place of residence/birth on differential disease patterns, disease prevalence and mortality among the various populations. Complicating matters further, Caribbean populations are admixed with varying degrees of genetic influences from African, European, Asian Indian and Asian Chinese genetic ancestral lineages; thereby making it difficult to treat Caribbean- Americans, Caribbean residents and new immigrants as a homogenous population. The Specific Aims of the conference are: Aim 1: Disseminate culturally specific evidence-based strategies that will maximize community outreach activities and promote health awareness among Caribbean nations, and Caribbean-American subpopulations; Aim 2: Connect key stakeholders from the Caribbean community with healthcare professionals, healthcare systems, and genomic scientists in the U.S. to accelerate collaborations and communications related to improving health and treatment outcomes of Caribbean nations and Caribbean- American subpopulations; Aim 3: Facilitate the development of genomic clinical studies, admixture mapping, and genotype-stratified trials that are more inclusive of Caribbean nations and Caribbean-American subpopulations; and Aim 4: Promote workforce diversity in health disparities research by providing a pre- conference Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) workshop for scientists, health professionals and under-represented students interested in working with Caribbean nations and Caribbean-American subpopulations to address health inequities. The conference will foster a dynamic environment that will lead to the creation of transdisciplinary networks consisting of domestic and international Caribbean community advocates, genomic scientists, epidemiologists and health professionals who will work closely to pioneer strategies for 1) improving health education among Caribbean nations, U.S. territories and Americans of Caribbean descent, 2) implementing evidenced based interventions and 3) using genome-guided therapeutic approaches to address disease prevention and treatment outcomes in Caribbean- American subpopulations. The supporting plenary sessions and activities are designed to disseminate best practices in community engagement, to discuss potential disease biomarkers associated with this population, to explore the benefits of use of precision medicine and to prepare the next generation of biomedical investigators who engage in translational and community-based participatory research. Project Narrative  Hampton University is proposing a conference titled “Hampton University’s First Annual Caribbean Health Conference – Addressing Inequities One Step at a Time” with the short-term overarching goals to promote collaborations, research, and discovery in the investigation of the biological, ancestral, environmental and psychosocial determinants which impact health outcomes in the Caribbean region and within its various Afro-origin subpopulations as it relates to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and HIV. This goal is borne out of the observation that the causes of health inequities in Caribbean-American subpopulations have been understudied and, thus, there is limited information regarding disease etiology, pathogenesis and effectiveness of therapeutic management. We hypothesize that the networks and infrastructure built, as well as the information gathered at this conference will provide a framework for Caribbean health disparities and equity research at Hampton University and beyond.",Hampton University’s First Annual Caribbean Health Conference – Addressing Inequities One Step at a Time,9544561,R13MD012764,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Antigua ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Bahamas ', ' Barbados ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Environment ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Incidence ', ' Island ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' mortality ', ' Paper ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' Tobago ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' West Indies ', ' Caribbean Islands ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Gender ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Barbuda ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' British Virgin Islands ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Evaluation ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Trinidad ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' posters ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Endometrial Carcinoma ', ' Endometrium Carcinoma ', ' Endometrium Cancer ', ' Endometrial Cancer ', ' One-Step dentin bonding system ', ' One Step ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' Manuscripts ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' social ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Hindu ', ' Asian Indian ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' therapeutic effectiveness ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' evidence base ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' health equity ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' under-represented student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' admixture mapping ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' treatment services ', ' ']",NIMHD,HAMPTON UNIVERSITY,R13,2018,50000,0.11090468177650238

"2018 Biomineralization Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Summary  Proper development and function of biomineralized tissues such as bones, teeth, and otoconia are of great importance to human health and well-being. However, there is a great number of developmental disorders (e.g., osteogenesis imperfecta, amelogenesis imperfecta, or molar incisor hypomineralization) and other pathophysiological conditions (such as caries, osteonecrosis of the jaw, osteoporosis, urolithiasis, aortic stenosis, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) that greatly affect quality of life. For several of these there are significant health disparities, and quite a few of them are expected to become more important as the population ages. However, many of the basic mechanisms of the development and properties of mineralized tissues, and of the pathophysiological processes that attack them remain poorly understood. Similarly, our ability to design and synthesize materials that interface with mineralized tissues, restore them, or replace them, are rather limited. The Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Biomineralization is a cross-cutting, highly interdisciplinary international meeting that covers all aspects of biomineralization research in health, life, physical, earth, and engineering sciences. By focusing on fundamental biotic and abiotic structures and mechanisms, i.e. the underlying concepts that are relevant to all organismal and mineral systems, this meeting creates a platform for researchers that would not necessarily interact otherwise. Thus, the organizers hope foster cross-disciplinary synergy and closer interaction between fundamental and translational, basic and engineering research.  The organizing team is committed to encourage participation of young investigators, foster interactions with senior researchers, and provide mentoring. Following the trend of previous meetings, we expect that ~30-35% of the GRC participants will be graduate students, 10-15% postdocs, and 5-10% pre-tenure faculty, with >60% of all participants in their 20s and 30s. The GRS is a small, informal meeting attracting 50-75 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early-career faculty. It is structured to help early-career researchers overcome the sometimes-daunting prospect of interacting so closely with leaders in their field. The intention is not only to assemble a program of diverse, top-caliber research in the field, but also to provide a unique opportunity for attendees to participate in in-depth, but comparatively “low pressure” scientific discussions, to provide mentorship to young researchers beginning their careers, and to extend their contacts and confidence.  The team is further committed to highlight the best science while ensuring that women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are appropriately represented and has assembled a program that is almost perfectly balanced in terms of gender representation 50% female invited speakers, and 44% female discussion leaders. Furthermore 21% of the provisional US speakers belong to underrepresented minorities. Narrative  The goal of this project is to support participation of young and experienced researchers at the 2018 Gordon Research Seminar and Gordon Research Conference on Biomineralization. This meeting is broadly relevant to public health as it covers all aspects of biomineralization research, including the development, pathophysiology, and properties of mineralized tissues such as bones, teeth, and otoconia, but also of urinary tract stones and calcification of vasculature and tumor tissues. Furthermore, the conference will address the design of materials that interface with, restore, or replace mineralized tissues.",2018 Biomineralization Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar,9613541,R13DE028191,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amelogenesis Imperfecta ', ' Aortic Valve Stenosis ', ' Aortic Stenosis ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biology ', ' bone ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incisor ', ' Jaw ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Minerals ', ' Osteogenesis Imperfecta ', ' brittle bone disease ', ' Osteogenesis Imperfect ', ' Fragilitas Ossium ', ' Bone necrosis ', ' Osteonecrosis ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' otoconia ', ' otocyst ', ' Statoconia ', ' Otoliths ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Urinary Calculi ', ' Urolith ', ' Urinary Tract Stones ', ' Urinary Stones ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' labyrinthine positional nystagmus ', ' familial vestibulopathy ', ' benign parxysmal vertigo ', ' Benign paroxysmal postural vertigo ', ' Benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus ', ' Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ', ' Intention ', ' Calcified ', ' calcification ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Dental ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Earth ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' urolithiasis ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' synergism ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' graduate student ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' developmental disease ', ' developmental disorder ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Address ', ' International ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' biomineralization ', ' comparative ', ' minimally invasive ', ' early-career faculty ', ' materials science ', ' ']",NIDCR,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,23000,0.07645334884172753
"1st Southern Genome Maintenance Conference Project Summary / Abstract The Southern Genome Maintenance Conference will be held October 20-21, 2018 in Mobile, Alabama. This would be the 1st in what we hope is an biennial event at different cities around the Gulf Coast and Southern US region (every other year), with the next meeting scheduled for 2020. This first conference will be held at the Holiday Inn conference center (Downtown Mobile, historic district). We have commitments from colleagues to host future conferences in Atlanta, New Orleans and two locations in Miami. The general meeting layout would be a focus on three sessions and themes that resonate strongly with those in this region due to health disparities in cancer and disease as well as the regional impact of the environment on the population living in the gulf coast region: (1) DNA repair, genome integrity and cancer therapy; (2) Environmental influences of genomic integrity and (3) DNA repair, disease and health disparities. The correlation between DNA repair, mutagenesis, environmental exposure and the progression of various diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, has been studied for decades. It has been proposed that all cancers display defects in one of more DNA repair pathways, lending importance to the discussion of this topic at the Southern Genome Maintenance Conference. Another factor that influences the interplay between DNA repair and the resulting mortality rates from disease is health disparities. The Southern Genome Maintenance Conference will include the participation of researchers from states such as Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida and others. Notable new findings that will be discussed will lead to an increased momentum in driving basic and translational research within this region, across disciplines and universities. Therefore, a major goal of this meeting is to foster collaborative research on the cellular processes that affect genomic instability in cancer, upon environmental exposure and as a result of health disparities. Further, a key objective of the meeting is to provide an environment for both early career and senior investigators to communicate their latest results on relevant scientific topics, to promote collaboration within and across disciplines and to enhance the development of the next generation of researchers.

"11th AACR Conference on The Science of Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed conference, titled “The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,” will be held from November 2-5, 2018 in New Orleans, Louisiana. This proposed conference will be the eleventh in an AACR series focused specifically on the science of cancer health disparities. The first conference on The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved was held in 2007, then annually from 2009-2017. While most conferences on cancer health disparities focus on policy and public health issues, the goal of this conference is to incorporate perspectives from basic scientists and clinicians in conjunction with policy and public health. Transdisciplinary interactions between a variety of disciplines, including basic science, clinical research, population science, behavioral research, and cancer survivorship, are needed to move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating disparities as they relate to cancer. Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer rates are well documented. While data suggest that differing levels of access to quality care contribute to cancer disparities, other factors also play a major role, including tumor biology, genetics, hormonal status, lifestyle and behavior, screening policies, comorbidities, environmental exposure and risk, quality of and response to therapy, and post-therapeutic surveillance. The goal of this conference and the conference series is to bring together scientists and other professionals working in a variety of disciplines to discuss the latest findings in the field and to stimulate the development of new research in cancer health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer incidence and death statistics show that certain racial and ethnic groups in the United States suffer disproportionately from cancer and its associated effects. These disparities may be explained by socioeconomic and cultural factors, biologic basis, differences in hormonal status and genetic variants, or differences in inherited susceptibilities and molecular pathways for pathogenesis.

"Optimizing Neurodevelopmental Outcomes for Survivors with Congenital Heart Disease: Knowledge Gaps, Research Challenges and Opportunities Project Summary/Abstract The objectives of this conference are to bring together cardiac neurodevelopmental research and clinical leaders, experts in quality improvement science and health disparities, and community stakeholders to explore and identify critical gaps in knowledge, research challenges/opportunities and promising prevention/intervention strategies for neurodevelopmental deficits among survivors with congenital heart disease (CHD). In the past three decades, the population of survivors with CHD has dramatically increased and significant neurodevelopmental and psychosocial deficits have become evident. These morbidities impact functional outcomes and health-related quality of life for children with CHD, and complicate or delay the transition to an independent adulthood. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, American Heart Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, and Adult Congenital Heart Association have all prioritized research to determine the prevalence and risks for neurodevelopmental and psychosocial deficits, their associated impact across the lifespan, and the development of interventions to mitigate these morbidities. This conference grant has been prepared in partnership with the Cardiac Neurodevelopmental Outcome Collaborative (CNOC), a multi-center, interdisciplinary organization that aims to optimize neurodevelopmental outcomes for individuals with pediatric and congenital heart disease through clinical, quality, and research initiatives. In preparation for the conference, an interdisciplinary group of experts identified key domains crucial to advancements in cardiac neurodevelopmental care: 1) Fetal Brain Development and Neuroprotection, 2) Surgical/Perioperative Neuroprotection and Neurodevelopment, 3) Characterization of Neurodevelopmental and Psychosocial Outcomes, 4) Neurodevelopmental and Psychosocial Intervention, 5) Family Stress and Coping, and 6) Neurodevelopmental Education, Outreach and Advocacy. Six working groups have been formed around these key domains and will meet concurrently during the conference to explore and identify critical gaps in knowledge, research challenges/opportunities and promising prevention/intervention strategies for neurodevelopmental deficits among survivors of CHD within each respective domain. A white paper deliverable detailing critical gaps in knowledge, research challenges/opportunities and priorities for the cardiac neurodevelopment research agenda will result directly from this conference. Project Narrative Neurodevelopmental and psychosocial deficits among survivors with congenital heart disease are common, and limit the functional outcomes, educational achievement, employability, lifelong earnings, insurability, and quality of life of this rapidly growing population. This conference will stimulate collaborative and clinically relevant research and quality improvement initiatives that align with the priorities of NHLBI to determine the prevalence of neurodevelopmental and psychosocial deficits, their associated impacts across the lifespan, and potential interventions to prevent and mitigate these morbidities.","Optimizing Neurodevelopmental Outcomes for Survivors with Congenital Heart Disease: Knowledge Gaps, Research Challenges and Opportunities",9544618,R13HL142298,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Family ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Productivity ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Survivors ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' fetal ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' American ', ' neuroprotection ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Participant ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Perioperative ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' internet portal ', ' web portal ', ' care costs ', ' ']",NHLBI,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,R13,2018,24400,0.07324523248493853

"National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal for continued support of five yearly three-day stand-alone National Hispanic Science Network (NHSN) conferences. The NHSN is dedicated to improving health equity of Hispanics by increasing the amount, quality, and dissemination of interdisciplinary translational research; and fostering the development, advancement, and promotion of future Hispanic scientists and leaders. The NHSN conference will involve participation of members of the global research community focused on different aspects of alcohol and drug abuse including epidemiology, toxicology, environmental health, intervention science, psychology, sociology, health policy, and neurobiology as it pertains to Hispanic populations. The NHSN conference is unique in that it will congregate experts, who attend scientific conferences specific to their area of interest, and who otherwise would not have an opportunity to engage in this inter-professional and transdisciplinary scientific discourse. Because many of the socio cultural factors and co-morbid conditions relevant to Hispanic communities are shared with other underrepresented minority (URM) populations, we plan to expand the scope of the conference (on alternate years) to include African-American, Asian-American, Native-American workgroup participation. The proposed yearly conferences will continue to serve as the unique venue for transdisciplinary and inter-professional scientific discussions on strategies towards minimizing the impact of alcohol and drug abuse and their co-morbid conditions on health disparities in Hispanics and other URM. In addition, they will foster the recruitment, retention, development and advancement of Hispanic scientists to promote future leaders in areas related to alcohol and drug abuse research. This conference will provide an opportunity for trainees from diverse gender, ethnicity, discipline, and geographic locations to come together and participate in a multidisciplinary scientific meeting, establish peer-support groups, and develop professional relationships that will provide venues for innovative developments in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics constitute the largest racial/ethnic minority population in the United States and are disproportionately impacted by alcohol and drug abuse. There is a pressing need to study the biological, individual, family, community, legal, and contextual factors that differentially affect substance use, its consequences, and the use of treatment services in Hispanic populations through inter-disciplinary and translational approaches. The proposed yearly conferences will continue to serve as the premier venue for transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and inter-professional scientific discussions on strategies towards minimizing the impact of alcohol and drug abuse on health disparities in Hispanics and other underrepresented minority groups.",National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference,9482700,R13DA026647,"['Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Communities ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Family ', ' Fertilization ', ' Fertility/Fertilization ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Louisiana ', ' Mentors ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Parents ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Sociology ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Discipline ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Native Americans ', ' Genetic ', ' Research Priority ', ' Scientist ', ' Location ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' research data dissemination ', ' research dissemination ', ' Health Sciences ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Community Practice ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' dissemination research ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' translational strategy ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' Hispanic Graduate Student ', ' peer support ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' ']",NIDA,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R13,2018,93000,0.01962501436867382
"Time Use Across the Life Course: Multigenerational Family Health and Well-Being Project Summary This proposal requests five years of support for two biennial conferences on intersections of time use, family inequality, and well-being. The proposal builds on the 10 year history of successful time use conferences sponsored by the Maryland Population Research Center and co-organized by faculty from the Departments of Sociology and Economics and the School of Public Health. The aims of the proposal are to 1) offer a forum for dialogue among senior and new time use, public health, and social and social and behavioral science scholars on innovative research on time use and child and family well-being across diverse families; 2) Identify emerging issues in how life course variation in time use patterns is linked with developmental and role transitions and adult and family well-being, emphasizing differences by gender, race-ethnicity, and education; 3) Foster interdisciplinary and international research teams who will develop pioneering projects on emerging issues identified in Aim 2; and 4) Facilitate translational research projects that apply knowledge about how time use variation across the life course and by gender, parenthood, race-ethnicity, and education influences well- being to identify ways to improve effectiveness and scope of related programs and policies. To address these aims, the proposed three biennial conferences are designed to provide a forum for dialogue about integrating time use data with cross-disciplinary perspectives and tools on life course research and provide opportunities for the formation of new interdisciplinary teams and increasing the number of scholars from underrepresented groups applying time use data to emerging time-use-related social issues. Relevance Changes in family structure, living arrangements and population aging are altering life course work and family trajectories, time transfers up and down the generational ladder, and social integration. Time diary surveys provide reliable, detailed, and comparable data on how family and social change influence children and adult’s social integration, economic participation and health-related behaviors (e.g. eating, sleep, leisure). Time diary data can be used to examine how work and leisure activities are associated with stress and enjoyment, as well as the formation of cognitive, physical, economic, and social capital and, with GPS integration, daily exposure to environmental stressors like pollution, high-crime areas, and food deserts.",Time Use Across the Life Course: Multigenerational Family Health and Well-Being,9481291,R13HD088085,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Crime ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Institutes ', ' Leisure Activities ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Maryland ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Sociology ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Leisures ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Employment Status ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' environmental stressor ', ' social integration ', ' intergenerational ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' family structure ', ' social ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Cognitive ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R13,2018,6000,0.042238020967905215
"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce.

"13th International Conference on HIV Treatment, Pathogenesis, and Prevention Research (Interest) Abstract.  The most recent UNAIDS estimates of the global burden of HIV are that 36.9 million people are living with HIV-1 infection worldwide, with 70% of these residing in sub-Saharan Africa. Markedly, three in four new infections in sub-Saharan Africa are among girls aged 15–19 years and young women aged 15–24 years are twice as likely to be living with HIV than men. Further, a striking difference exists between the east/southern and the west/central regions of sub-Saharan Africa, with reductions in AIDS-related deaths since 2010 of 42% and 21%, respectively. Clearly, much work remains in terms of training local physicians and scientists in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of individuals with HIV-1 infection; conducting implementation science to determine the most cost-effective use of financial and human resources; and ensuring evidence-informed public health policy and programming to reduce disparities in the AIDS response across Africa’s sub-regions. Despite treatment likely having contributed to slowing HIV transmission, HIV prevention remains critical to stem the tide of HIV. In fact, a second AIDS pandemic in the next 12 years is predicted due to 1) changing demographics in Africa with increasing numbers of youth, 2) increasing transmitted viral drug resistance, and 3) increased cost and limited availability of 2nd and 3rd line treatment regimens. Taken together, these factors suggest that the total number of people living with AIDS may increase by 2 million/year to reach a staggering 50 million by 2030.  Since 2007, 12 successful annual INTEREST Conferences, known as the ‘African CROI’, have brought together scientists involved in HIV diagnosis and treatment, pathogenesis, and prevention research in resource-limited settings in Africa to share pivotal findings, promote collaboration, and transfer experiences across several fields and many continents. Planning and organization of the 2019 INTEREST Conference will be overseen by the Amsterdam Institute of Global Health and Development. Catherine Hankins MD PhD chairs INTEREST’s international organizing committee (IOC) and is the Scientific Chair of INTEREST. Professor Kwasi Torpey of the University of Ghana College of Health Sciences is the Local Chair for INTEREST 2019.  The organizers of the 2019 INTEREST Conference will pursue the following objectives: 1) To provide cutting-edge knowledge in the fields of HIV-1 diagnosis and treatment,  pathogenesis, and prevention for adults, including the elderly; adolescents; and children  living with HIV in Africa in order to contribute to achieving the 90-90-90 goals and to  preventing a 2nd great pandemic. 2) To foster new research interactions among leading investigators and those who represent  the future scientific leadership for health care and research on the African continent. Project Narrative. There is an increasing effort currently to control local HIV epidemics in Africa by providing effective treatment and prevention strategies for people living with HIV-1 infection. The 2019 INTEREST Conference will focus on the scientific training and capacity building of young African clinicians and scientists whose scope of work is to implement and evaluate evidence-based: 1) early diagnosis and clinical care for HIV-1 infection, 2) effective anti-retroviral treatment, and 3) tailored prevention strategies. Moreover, the three-day INTEREST conference which profiles state-of-the-art science will support the career development of young African clinicians and scientists by: 1) fostering local and international scientific exchange; 2) providing opportunities to present their results; and 3) facilitating their close interaction with scientific peers and invited international experts to explore career choices and opportunities for scientific collaboration.","13th International Conference on HIV Treatment, Pathogenesis, and Prevention Research (Interest)",9778943,R13AI145563,"['Acquired

"10th IAS Conference on HIV Science (IAS 2019), Mexico City, Mexico, 21-24 July 2019 Project Summary Despite remarkable advancements in HIV science and markedly increasing access to essential HIV services worldwide, we are at a critical juncture in the HIV response. We are witnessing an alarming shift in risk and disease burden towards key populations and other vulnerable groups. While some of the inequities in access to prevention and treatment that underly these disparities are due to policy challenges, a concerted research effort is required to increase and expand available options, particularly with a view to those that are low cost to facilitate scale up and deepen our understanding of efficient and successful implementation approaches. Science is needed for evidence-based, effective and equitable tools to achieving both epidemic control and universal access to essential services. IAS 2019 will be the key global scientific convening to review progress against remaining challenges in controlling the epidemic just one year before the global targets of reducing new infections and the number of AIDS-related deaths to less than 500,000 per year, and to eliminate HIV-related discrimination. To this end the conference will facilitate rapid translation of new science into practice and define course corrections for HIV research on the path towards control of the epidemic and sustained adherence support for those living with HIV. Emphasis will be placed on the integration of basic science into clinical practice and the use of data for higher operational efficiency. IAS 2019, taking place in Mexico City from 21-24 July 2019, has an expected attendance of 6,000 delegates from more than 125 countries. It will shine a spotlight on the Latin American experience where impressive progress has been made over the past ten years in increasing the number of people who know their HIV status and receive treatment, and where commitment to funding the HIV response is strong. Mexico has a long history of leadership in coordinating and funding a robust HIV response that spans training, research and south to south exchange, and includes innovation in the way state institutions work together and with civil society. The specific aims of IAS 2019 are to: 1. Accelerate basic science to shape the advancement and application of innovative technologies across the  HIV prevention, and treatment cascade, including pathogenesis, transmission, vaccines, remission and a cure; 2. Accelerate updates to treatment guidance especially for low and middle-income countries, including  pharmacovigilance in pregnant women, infected children and HIV-exposed, uninfected children; 3. Fast-track consolidated responses to HIV co-infections (notably TB and viral hepatitis) and to emerging  co-morbidities and other non-communicable diseases; 4. Strengthen HIV prevention research to improve biomedical, behavioral and structural interventions; 5. Advance core components of implementation science research that address the challenges and  opportunities of integration across a range of epidemic settings; 6. Address HIV vulnerability and determinants of disease progression among key and marginalized  populations, including novel interventions and implementation science to reduce stigma and discrimination. The scientific program will consist of four tracks: Track A – Basic Science; Track B – Clinical Science; Track C – Prevention Science; and Track D – Social, Behavioral, and Implementation Research. Cross-cutting aspects will be covered in plenary talks that also connect the scientific tracks with community and leadership perspectives, and bridging sessions will cut across at least two of the tracks to provide opportunities for multi- disciplinary dialogues. The participation of young researchers, basic scientists and researchers in related fields such as non-communicable diseases will be strengthened by active solicitation of relevant science and the provision of specific financial support, in addition to increased remote-access options.

"Disaster Response Research (DR2) Workshop Disasters expose the general population and responders to a range of potential contaminants and stressors, which may impact both physical and mental health. Since nearly all disasters, whether natural or man-made, have an environmental health component, it is critical that specialized research tools and trained researchers be readily available to evaluate and ascertain causal links between complex exposures and short- and long- term health outcomes, especially for vulnerable sub-populations such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with socioeconomic and environmental disparities. Ideally, environmental health science research can also be utilized to guide the policies needed to address health consequences and mitigate health impacts of future disasters, as well as for protection of first responders; however, a major challenge is connecting our nation’s policymakers with research that can increase community resiliency and protect public health. This proposal seeks funds to support a workshop to be held in conjunction with the 2019 National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) Legislative Summit, entitled: “Disaster Preparedness and Response Research: A Workshop for the National Conference of State Legislatures”. The NCSL Legislative Summit is scheduled for August 5th-8th 2019 in Nashville, Tennessee. The proposed workshop is planned as a “pre- conference” event to be held August 5th 2019, on the first day of the Summit. The overarching goal of the workshop is to foster dialog between active environmental health science researchers and state legislators, in order to share accurate, scientific information, and to translate current research results relevant to pressing environmental health issues that face constituents and communities. The objectives/specific aims of this conference proposal are to: 1) Communicate the importance and impact of disaster response research on community resiliency for state legislators and their staff members. 2) Promote dialogue about how NIEHS- funded research can help guide disaster response for States. 3) Foster research, translation, and engagement among state legislators, federal agencies, and NIEHS-funded disaster scientists. The proposed workshop lends expertise from multiple NIEHS-funded centers, including the University of Kentucky (UK), University of Iowa (UI), and University of Washington (UW), and provides an ideal opportunity for environmental health science researchers to communicate quality information to state legislators and legislative staff regarding the environmental health issues that face their constituents and communities. This workshop will provide state policymakers insight into the depth and breadth of research available from NIEHS-funded research centers, including policy solutions necessary to respond to disaster recovery and mitigate the impact of future disasters.

"Time Use Across the Life Course: Multigenerational Family Health and Well-Being Project Summary This proposal requests five years of support for two biennial conferences on intersections of time use, family inequality, and well-being. The proposal builds on the 10 year history of successful time use conferences sponsored by the Maryland Population Research Center and co-organized by faculty from the Departments of Sociology and Economics and the School of Public Health. The aims of the proposal are to 1) offer a forum for dialogue among senior and new time use, public health, and social and social and behavioral science scholars on innovative research on time use and child and family well-being across diverse families; 2) Identify emerging issues in how life course variation in time use patterns is linked with developmental and role transitions and adult and family well-being, emphasizing differences by gender, race-ethnicity, and education; 3) Foster interdisciplinary and international research teams who will develop pioneering projects on emerging issues identified in Aim 2; and 4) Facilitate translational research projects that apply knowledge about how time use variation across the life course and by gender, parenthood, race-ethnicity, and education influences well- being to identify ways to improve effectiveness and scope of related programs and policies. To address these aims, the proposed three biennial conferences are designed to provide a forum for dialogue about integrating time use data with cross-disciplinary perspectives and tools on life course research and provide opportunities for the formation of new interdisciplinary teams and increasing the number of scholars from underrepresented groups applying time use data to emerging time-use-related social issues. Relevance Changes in family structure, living arrangements and population aging are altering life course work and family trajectories, time transfers up and down the generational ladder, and social integration. Time diary surveys provide reliable, detailed, and comparable data on how family and social change influence children and adult’s social integration, economic participation and health-related behaviors (e.g. eating, sleep, leisure). Time diary data can be used to examine how work and leisure activities are associated with stress and enjoyment, as well as the formation of cognitive, physical, economic, and social capital and, with GPS integration, daily exposure to environmental stressors like pollution, high-crime areas, and food deserts.",Time Use Across the Life Course: Multigenerational Family Health and Well-Being,9693770,R13HD088085,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Crime ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' financial assistance ', ' Financial Support ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Institutes ', ' Leisure Activities ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Maryland ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Sociology ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Leisures ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Employment Status ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' environmental stressor ', ' social integration ', ' intergenerational ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Structure ', ' family structure ', ' social ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' NICHD ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' time use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R13,2019,500,0.042238020967905215
"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce.

"Teratology Society 2019 Annual Meeting - Trainee Travel Awards and Speaker Travel The Teratology Society will hold its 59th Annual Meeting at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina, San Diego, California—June 22–26, 2019. The scientific program covers a wide-range of cutting-edge research in birth defects and disorders of developmental origin. The 2019 session topics include health disparities that increase maternal morbidity and mortality and successful strategies to reduce complications of childbirth, a review of choline supplementation to prevent or treat neurological disorders, advances in identifying teratogenic agents, the treatment and management of birth defects across the lifespan, and the effects of prenatal environmental exposures on the developing immune system. Other sessions will focus on the value of zebrafish in identifying mechanisms of teratogenesis, ocean-borne risks to pregnant women and their babies from aerosols and marine toxins to hurricane impacts, and the inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials. The keynote address will provide early insights in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program. Meeting attendees historically come from diverse professional backgrounds including basic and clinical scientists from the academic, industrial, and government research sectors. The Teratology Society Annual Meeting provides a unique forum where basic, clinical, and epidemiologic researchers come together to share progress toward a common understanding of the causes and mechanisms of birth defects and developmental disorders, and to translate these discoveries into clinical practice. New to the 2019 meeting is a focus on innovation with a platform session devoted to finalists for the Society’s new Innovator Award.  The Society strives to encourage, engage, and mentor students and new/early stage investigators (trainees), recognizing that its trainees represent the future of both the Society and the important scientific work necessary to fulfill its mission to understand and prevent birth defects. This work extends to recruiting and mentoring students from under-represented and under-served populations. The 2019 meeting recruitment will include extensive outreach to San Diego’s large Hispanic population. Specific events at the Annual Meeting encourage trainee participation, including a breakfast event where trainees are paired 1:1 with members for in depth discussion of research and career paths; a career night to introduce trainees to members from different disciplines; and a luncheon workshop highlighting professional development topics. Trainees are encouraged to present their research; eight to ten trainees are invited to compete for the prestigious Wilson presentation award in a special platform session, and all trainee poster presentations are judged for best poster presentation awards. Trainees are also encouraged to serve as ad hoc members on Society committees, thereby deepening their involvement within the Society. In this application, we are requesting funds to support Travel Awards for trainees to attend the 2019-2023 Annual Meetings, and to partially support travel expenses of key nonmember speakers who will help us educate and inspire these trainees. For fifty-eight years, the Teratology Society has promoted basic and clinical research to understand the causes and mechanisms of birth defects, the potential effects of drug, chemical, infectious or other exposures on the developing embryo/fetus, improve reproductive health, understand developmental origins of adult disease, and translate these discoveries into clinical practice. The Annual Meeting provides a forum for scientists, clinicians, and science policy regulators from academic, industrial, and government sectors to present cutting-edge research, exchange ideas and information, and engage in discussions among established experts in the field, new researchers, and students.

"17th Biennial International Photodynamic Association World Congress Project Summary / Abstract The mission of the International Photodynamic Association (IPA) is to promote basic, translational, and clinical research in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photodiagnosis (PD), modalities which involve treatment and diagnosis of human disease using light-activated molecules called photosensitizers. The IPA is hosting the 17th Biennial World Congress to be held in handicap accessible Boston Marriot Cambridge Hotel in Cambridge, MA from June 28-July 4, 2019. The conference will be chaired by Dr. Tayyaba Hasan, Professor at Harvard Medical School, who has extensive experience chairing and organizing scientific conferences. A summary of the Conference plan is presented here. Highlights of the plan are: 1.) It is hoped that the Conference will open with lectures from 2 Nobel Laureates to inspire the young and established scientists. 2.) PDT School to provide an overview of the field to a broad audience. 3.) A clinical workshop to highlight recent FDA and other worldwide approvals regarding relevant drugs and devices, and to identify a way forward for Image Guided Resection and Image-Guided PDT. (No human subjects). 4.) A workshop/brainstorming session with clinicians, basic scientists, engineers, NIH personnel, industry and venture capital representatives to carve a “Roadmap for Impact” where PDT & PD may occupy a unique niche. 5.) Events to assist early career scientists, young investigators, women, and minorities from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in science to network to help sustain interest in PDT & PD. As with past meetings, this conference will bring together students, postdoctoral fellows, independent researchers, representatives from industry, and clinicians practicing and researching PDT & PD to exchange information, share cutting-edge discoveries and challenges encountered, and encourage collaboration in order to effectively translate PDT & PD based technologies into the clinic. To this end, a number of leading researchers in the field have committed their support for the conference and agreed to present their work and offer their perspective on the field in the form of invited lectures. Students, researchers, and industry reps will be invited to submit abstracts for either oral or poster presentations, which will be then be selected by the conference Program Committee. A series of workshops and discussion sessions will be held to facilitate interaction among attendees from basic, translational, clinical, and industrial research backgrounds. The majority of funds requested in this application would go towards providing financial assistance for registration and travel for individuals from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in science. As this Congress will be held in the USA for the first time in a decade, we expect significant excitement among the community, especially for researchers and companies based in the US, and anticipate 400-600 attendees. The impact on public health will be derived from the “Roadmap for Impact” for applications of Optical Imaging and PDT in medicine that underlies the ethos of the conference.

"AACR Conference on The Science of Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed conference series, titled “The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,” will be held annually in the fall (2019-2023). The 2019 conference will be held September 20-23, 2019 in San Francisco, California. The locations of the 2020-2023 conferences remain to be selected, but will be chosen based upon the future needs and growth of the conference series. This proposed conference series will be the 12th-16th in an AACR series focused specifically on the science of cancer health disparities. The first conference on The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved was held in 2007, then annually from 2009-2018. While most conferences on cancer health disparities focus on policy and public health issues, the goal of this conference is to incorporate perspectives from basic scientists and clinicians in conjunction with policy and public health. Transdisciplinary interactions between a variety of disciplines, including basic science, clinical research, population science, behavioral research, and cancer survivorship, are needed to move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating disparities as they relate to cancer. Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer rates are well documented. While data suggest that differing levels of access to quality care contribute to cancer disparities, other factors also play a role, including tumor biology, genetics, hormonal status, lifestyle and behavior, screening policies, comorbidities, environmental exposure and risk, quality of and response to therapy, and post-therapeutic surveillance. The goal of this conference and the conference series is to bring together scientists and other professionals working in a variety of disciplines to discuss the latest findings in the field and to stimulate the development of new research in cancer health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer incidence and death statistics show that certain racial and ethnic groups in the United States suffer disproportionately from cancer and its associated effects. These disparities may be explained by socioeconomic and cultural factors, biological basis, differences in hormonal status and genetic variants, or differences in inherited susceptibilities and molecular pathways for pathogenesis. Over the next 5 years, this conference will continue to bring together basic scientists, physicians, behavioral researchers, population researchers, and other health professionals to foster discussions and collaborations between early-career and senior scientists, moving the field forward, and continue to make progress in reducing and eliminating cancer health disparities.",AACR Conference on The Science of Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,9763044,R13CA239609,"['Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Incidence ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Research Technics ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Scientist ', ' Location ', ' Hormonal ', ' skills ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Population Sciences ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' AACR ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Science ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Molecular ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' medically underserved ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' screening policy ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2019,99000,0.16600294472236243
"National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference Abstract  ‐ This proposal is for renewal of the National Hispanic Science Network (NHSN) Annual Conference grant (R13 DA026647), to support five three day, stand-alone conferences. The NHSN is dedicated to improving health equity of Hispanics by increasing the amount, quality, and dissemination of interdisciplinary translational research and fostering the development, advancement, and promotion of future Hispanic scientists and leaders. The NHSN conference assembles members of the global research community focused on different aspects of substance use disorder including epidemiology, toxicology, environmental health, intervention science, psychology, sociology, health policy, and neurobiology as it pertains to Hispanic populations. The NHSN conference is unique in that it serves as a forum for transdisciplinary scientific discourse spanning from basic neuroscience to implementation science and policy. The NHSN conference serves as a venue for mentoring, networking, and professional development of scientists underrepresented in their respective disciplines. Because many of the sociocultural factors and comorbid conditions relevant to Hispanic communities are shared with other underrepresented minority (URM) populations, our goal is to expand the scope of the conference (on alternate years) to include African-American, Asian-American, and Native-American workgroup participation. The proposed yearly conferences will continue to serve as the unique venue for transdisciplinary and interprofessional scientific discussions on strategies towards minimizing the impact of substance use disorders and their comorbidities on health disparities in Hispanics and other URMs. In addition, the conferences will continue to foster recruitment, retention, development, and advancement of Hispanic scientists to promote future leaders in substance use disorder research and related areas. The NHSN conference is an opportunity for trainees of diverse gender, ethnicity, discipline, and geographic location to come together and participate in a multidisciplinary scientific meeting, establish peer support groups, and develop professional relationships that provide venues for innovative developments in the field. Project Narrative Underrepresented minority groups are disproportionately impacted by substance use disorder, and Hispanics (the largest racial/ethnic minority population in the United States) are overrepresented in the total number of individuals affected by substance use disorder. Hispanics are also underrepresented in biomedical, socio- behavioral, and implementation science disciplines, and the lack of Hispanic representation in these disciplines contributes to health disparities as they pertain to substance use and related comorbidities. The annual National Hispanic Science Network (NHSN) conference is the premier venue for transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and interprofessional scientific discussions on strategies to minimize the impact of substance use disorder on health disparities in Hispanics and other underrepresented minority groups as well as for promoting and strengthening Hispanic interdisciplinary social professional networks to address the disparities.",National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference,9763127,R13DA026647,"['Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Fertility/Fertilization ', ' Fertilization ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Mentors ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Sociology ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Discipline ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Native Americans ', ' Genetic ', ' Research Priority ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' Address ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Community Practice ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Science Policy ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' dissemination research ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' health equity ', ' Hispanic Graduate Student ', ' career networking ', ' speed networking ', ' professional networking ', ' career fair ', ' peer support ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDA,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R13,2019,75000,0.021037025802009304
"Interdisciplinary Aging Research to Address Health Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) Abstract The United States has invested significant resources through innovative research to address the profound effects of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADRD) on families and society, but older adults from historically underrepresented minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged adults (herein, older minorities) have not experienced the full benefits of scientific advances from that research. For example, older minorities live more years with undiagnosed disorders, endure a higher number of functional disabilities, have fewer treatment options, and experience higher levels of stigma. Hindering innovation and dissemination of approaches to ADRD health disparities research is the lack of a highly trained, interdisciplinary scientific workforce that addresses the full range of biological, biomedical, behavioral, and health sciences supported by NIH. This two-installment conference series will bring together emerging investigators from across the US to address the National Alzheimer Project Act (NAPA) 2017 goal of prevention and effective treatment of ADRD by 2025 as well as the National Institute on Aging Health Disparities Framework and NAPA's strategy (1.B) to address health disparities that influence ADRD health outcomes among older minorities. An essential feature of the series will be to engage community stakeholders (persons with ADRD, family caregivers, providers) in multiple aspects of the conference design, planning and implementation including the selection of scholars, providing feedback on conference presentations, and dissemination. Planning, implementation, participation and evaluation of the conference will incorporate individuals from historically underrepresented groups. The aims of the conference series are: (1) to examine existing research on ADRD health disparities and older minorities particularly in the epidemiology, etiology, identification, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of ADRD in the US; (2) to examine existing research studies intended to address multi-level factors that influence the health of persons with ADRD and family caregivers from diverse communities; (3) to develop the research careers of a diverse, highly trained, interdisciplinary team-based scientific workforce specializing in the diversity of experiences of older minorities and their families affected by ADRD; (4) to generate highly tailored, innovative, rigorous, team-based scientific proposals lead by the scholars cohort on ADRD health disparities; (5) to facilitate intensive mentoring and early engagement of emerging scholars in ADRD disparities research using a multi-mentor, multi-disciplinary team science approach; and (6) to create opportunities for community stakeholders, the scientific community, NIH directors and/or program officers to leverage collaborations in multi-investigator and multi-disciplinary projects. Project Narrative/Relevance: This 3-day conference will (1) address environmental, sociocultural, behavioral, and biological disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias that affect millions of older minorities and their family caregivers; and (2) serve as an incubator of scientific network of interdisciplinary scholars specializing in rigorous team- based approaches to close the ADRD health disparities gap.",Interdisciplinary Aging Research to Address Health Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD),9762603,R13AG063477,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incubators ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Societies ', ' United States ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' programs ', ' Sensory ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Emotional ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Sentinel ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Motor ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' AD prevention ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' care costs ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R13,2019,50000,0.005506618589148325
"HBCU Eradicating Economic and Health Disparities (HEEHD) 2019 Conference Project Summary  The United States (U.S.) has one of the largest income-based health disparities in the world with poor people, in the U.S, more likely than wealthy people not to have access to care because of cost, and more likely to report being dissatisfied with their last visit to the doctor. Moreover, many minority populations (e.g., African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans) suffer co-morbidities including, but not limited to, asthma, diabetes, and heart disease. Addressing health disparities is significant not only from a social justice standpoint, but also for improving the health of all Americans by achieving improvements in overall quality of care and population health. Moreover, health disparities amount to approximately $93 billion in excess medical care costs and $42 billion in lost productivity per year as well as economic losses due to premature deaths. To address health disparities, Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)s have potential to deliver a measurably effective intervention to develop sustainable biomedical & information technology related inventions that create intellectual property (i.e., copyright, patents, and trade-secret) for HBCUs around which students and faculty may develop products and services to generate technology transfer license revenue for HBCUs and continue developing solutions to eradicate U.S. health disparities. However, funding innovations is continuously a challenge. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant programs, like the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, provide opportunities for HBCUs to collaborate with small business (SB) to develop innovations that address health disparities. This program awarded three-quarters of a billion dollars in 2015 to help business translate biomedical discoveries into products. However, for minority African- American businesses, the SBIR program award funding was 0.7%; 1.7% for Hispanic-owned businesses; and 0% to Native American.  To address the aforementioned problems, Juxtopia and its team will organize the 1st Annual HBCU Eradicate Economic and Health Disparities (HEEHD) 2019 Conference. The HEEHD 2019 conference will invite peer reviewed empirical research, from HBCUs focused on techniques & methods that effectively facilitate innovative research and development; technology transfer; and resulting product/service commercialization to address health disparities in minority populations.  To accomplish this NIH R13 effort, the Juxtopia® team will accomplish the following three specific aims: A. Analyze Barriers preventing HBCUs from securing significant funding awards or translating research. B. Facilitate Scientific Discussion to devise effective methods for improving Biomedical Research. C. Facilitate Policy Discussions w/ federal & state governments, industry, & organizations on how HBCUs  can effectively apply their HEEHD training to address health disparities. I. Project Narrative  The proposed 1st HBCU Eradicating Economic and Health Disparities (HEEHD) 2019 conference will  address economic and health disparities. The HEEHD 2019 will organize faculty and students, from HBCUs,  to submit and present peer reviewed empirical research that focus on techniques & methods that effectively facilitate innovative research and development (R&D); technology transfer; and resulting product/service  commercialization to address health disparities in minority populations.",HBCU Eradicating Economic and Health Disparities (HEEHD) 2019 Conference,9837887,R13MD014687,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Copyright ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Endowment ', ' Engineering ', ' Faculty ', ' National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Industry ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Peer Review ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Plague ', ' Privatization ', ' Productivity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Social Justice ', ' Provincial Government ', ' State Government ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Entrepreneurial Skill ', ' Entrepreneurship ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Training ', ' Licensing ', ' Policies ', ' Technology Transfer ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Native Americans ', ' Nongovernmental Organizations ', ' Non-governmental Organizations ', ' Intellectual Property ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Empirical Research ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' skills ', ' graduate student ', ' Reporting ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' accomplished suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' commit suicide ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', "" Bachelor's Degree "", ' Undergraduate Degree ', ' Baccalaureate Degree ', ' Measurable ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' cost ', ' Information Technology ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' commercialization ', ' effective intervention ', ' population health ', ' Secure ', ' higher education ', ' invention ', ' off-patent ', ' ']",NIMHD,"JUXTOPIA, LLC",R13,2019,53000,0.05176785942216528
"NMA 2019 Addressing Health Disparities and Health Equity Issues in Internal Medicine: engage early career investigators and trainees to generate awareness of health disparities and research This proposed R13 application will focus on Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, HIV/AIDS, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Pulmonology, Nephrology, and Oncology subspecialty topics. The proposed title will be NMA 2019 Addressing Health Disparities and Health Equity Issues in Internal Medicine. We would engage early career investigators and trainees to generate awareness of health disparities and a focus on the quest of health equity in populations of need, when they attend our 2019 Annual Convention & Scientific Assembly, held at the Hawaii Convention Center, Honolulu HI, July 27 – 31, 2019. The program will be utilized to enhance the development and training of young investigators who have an interest in academic medicine and research, with a demonstrated desire to address disparities in health care. NMA Internal Medicine (IM) Section steering committee members and senior faculty will be available to network with and serve as mentors to the early career investigators. We allow all our award recipients to present their posters during the NMA General Poster Presentation session. This enables our early career investigators to be exposed to and interact with a broader audience of physicians beyond the internal medicine specialty such as, family medicine, emergency medicine, OB/GYN etc. Additionally, the highest scored abstracts will be invited to present their research in the form of a brief oral presentation within the appropriate subspecialty section during the IM sessions. There are five objectives to this conference session: (1) Provide a forum for cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas to further explore issues of health disparities and health equity; (2) Foster opportunities for early stage minority faculty and trainees to network and learn about current research in the internal medicine specialty; (3) Promote opportunities for all early stage faculty and trainees to present their research findings during the general NMA poster session and our general IM Session meeting; and integrate the top recipients of the abstract submissions as oral abstract presentations within the appropriate Internal Medicine specialty presentations; (4) Promote opportunities for trainees to buttress this academic experience by allowing them to attend an array of NMA general Scientific Section symposia during the entire NMA Convention period; (5) Promote opportunities for early stage faculty and trainee investigators to interact with more senior investigators working in the internal medicine specialties to enable them the opportunity to establish professional relationships that will provide early career guidance and for those interested “groom” them for future leadership in the NMA. This program is designed to foster the research pipeline of underrepresented trainees and early career investigators examining the barriers and root causes behind health disparities through mentorship and through the opportunity to participate in a national scientific conference focused on these issues. The results of increased health disparities/health determinants research -- particularly among underrepresented communities -- may ultimately lead to improved population and community health, which is safer, more accessible, affordable, and equitable.",NMA 2019 Addressing Health Disparities and Health Equity Issues in Internal Medicine: engage early career investigators and trainees to generate awareness of health disparities and research,9838121,R13DK122771,"['Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Cardiology ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Endocrinology ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Faculty ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Future ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' Grant ', ' Grooming ', ' Hawaii ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Directors ', ' Physician Executives ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Nephrology ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Pulmonary Medicine ', ' Pneumonology ', ' Pneumology ', ' Pulmonology ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Travel ', ' executive coaching ', ' career counselor ', ' Vocational Counseling ', ' Occupational Guidance ', ' Career Guidance ', ' Career Counseling ', ' Vocational Guidance ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' prevent violence ', ' violence prevention ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Exposure to ', ' posters ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Committee Members ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' early awareness ', ' Population ', ' health equity ', ' population health ', ' senior faculty ', ' full professor ', ' ']",NIDDK,NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,R13,2019,40000,0.0352734142902614

"ADAR Summit Meeting PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Creating experiences for underrepresented undergraduates in STEM fields where they can present their own research and experience a professional setting is important for developing their sense of self, and ability to persevere in a research career. Sharing one's research is an important step in that process. The proposed ADAR Summit meeting provides the financial support to make this happen for trainees in the MSTEM Advancing Diversity in Aging Research program. The proposed series of conferences will meet annually for five years, coinciding with the annual meeting of the Gerontological Society of America (GSA). There are 9 such programs currently. Each one has a different emphasis in the field of aging: biology, psychology, demography and more. As part of the ADAR program, students engage in mentored research projects in the field of aging. These projects will be presented at the conference either as presentations in the ADAR Summit meeting, or as part of a poster session within the broader GSA conference setting. The GSA will facilitate an integration of the ADAR Summit into the program. In each year in the ADAR Summit, there will be student presentations, presentations from established URM and other scholars, opportunities to speak with representatives from possible graduate schools, and networking time with the trainees from other institutions. The program will have different kinds of activities in order to fully engage the undergraduate students, including visiting the poster sessions in the GSA, attending sessions relevant to their field, and the book exhibits. In addition, the MSTEM ADAR program requires PIs to meet annually to discuss best practices, share advice and other experiences. The PIs will have time to meet for this purpose. As such, the primary goal of this conference series is to help solidify the self-image of trainees as STEM researchers in aging through positive reinforcement. The ADAR Summit is an important strategy for retention in budding research careers. Ultimately the goal is to have a research community of scientists that is representative of the overall United States population, in order to more accurately address health issues of the 21st century and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposed conference series will provide a venue for underrepresented minorities in STEM research in the field of aging. Trainees will have the opportunity to present their research, experience a conference setting, network with other trainees, faculty and established researchers, thereby developing confidence and a sense of belonging. This kind of experience is important for retention of URM students in STEM, ultimately leading to their ability to contribute to the health and well-being of individuals across the life course.",ADAR Summit Meeting,9914818,R13AG066389,"['Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Americas ', ' Books ', ' Boston ', ' Communities ', ' Demography ', ' Graduate Education ', ' Exhibits ', ' Faculty ', ' financial assistance ', ' Financial Support ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hearing ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Investments ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Positive Reinforcements ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Societies ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Self Perception ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' minority trainee ', ' STEM field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics major ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics course ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics class ', ' science, technology, engineering and math major ', ' science, technology, engineering and math field ', ' science, technology, engineering and math discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and math course ', ' science, technology, engineering and math class ', ' STEM major ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM class ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ', ' undergraduate education ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' STEM research ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics research ', ' science, technology, engineering and math research ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' mentoring community ', ' minority scientist ', ' supportive environment ', ' supportive atmosphere ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' enthusiastic atmosphere ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R13,2019,49543,0.06700818269440097

"Matchmaking in Science: Integration across Research, Clinical Practice, Community, and Policy Domains to Address Obesity Disparities Project Summary Using siloed approaches within the domains of research, clinical practice, community, and policy may be a contributor to the limited success of obesity interventions to date and the large racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence. On their own, efforts within each of these four domains hold some potential to improve healthy eating and physical activity, but the next frontier is to strategically integrate across these critical domains to advance high-impact efforts to reduce obesity disparities. The proposed R13 conference entitled, Matchmaking in Science: Integration across Research, Clinical Practice, Community, and Policy to Address Obesity Disparities was designed to move the science and practice of integration forward by addressing four aims, including: (1) train and build capacity in integration science and practice, (2) engage in real-time matchmaking of integrative teams across research, clinical practice, community, and policy domains, (3) establish a national network and database of integration scientists and practitioners, and (4) advance methods for evaluating integration science and practice. This conference will be delivered in two parts over one and one half days. The first half-day of the conference will bring together leaders in the field of integration science and practice with the aim of working on a state of the field of integration paper and to identify key skills and approaches for training and building capacity in integration science and practice (conference aim 1). The next full day of the conference will bring together scientists and practitioners in the field of obesity who are interested in moving their siloed or partially integrative work towards an integrative approach, in addition to early stage investigators and trainees from underrepresented communities who are the next generation of integration scientists. To further address conference aim 1, the second full day of the conference will start with a capacity-building module to train attendees in integration terminology, frameworks, and integration praxis and methods; this will include a self-assessment of mastery skills for integration practice. To address the second and third conference aims, real-time matchmaking across the domains of research, clinical practice, community, and policy will occur to advance integrative relationships and to create a national network and matchmaking database of integration scientists and practitioners. For example, one activity will be a “BIG Integrative Idea” matchmaking competitive pitch, in which integrative teams composed of all four domains of integration will be matched to develop a big idea to address obesity disparities. To address the fourth conference aim, evaluation of integration science and practice will be addressed to ensure this powerful work is being documented and measured. Outputs of the conference include a state-of-the art paper on integration science and the creation of a matchmaking database via MatchApp to facilitate matchmaking of integrative projects. We are requesting co-sponsorship of this R13 by NHLBI (primary sponsor) and NIMHD (secondary sponsor), based on their similar missions to address obesity disparities. Project Narrative The proposed Matchmaking in Science: Integration across Research, Clinical Practice, Community, and Policy to Address Obesity Disparities R13 conference will: (a) train and build capacity in integration science and practice, (b) facilitate real-time matchmaking of integrative teams, (c) establish a national network and database of integration scientists and practitioners, and (d) advance evaluation of integration science and practice to target obesity disparities.","Matchmaking in Science: Integration across Research, Clinical Practice, Community, and Policy Domains to Address Obesity Disparities",9837216,R13HL149439,"['Award ', ' Communities ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Terminology ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Paper ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Scholarship ', ' Science ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Community Practice ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' frontier ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' clinical practice ', ' federal policy ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R13,2019,30000,0.08176813333351854
"2019 CFAR Women and HIV Symposium Summary: The goal of the Inter-CFAR collaborative symposium entitled “HIV and Women 2019” is to share cutting edge research, extend knowledge and foster action to address gaps toward understanding the complex clinical, biological and social aspects of HIV in women. In contrast to other conferences, HIV and Women 2019 focuses on all aspects of HIV in the context of women including structural and behavioral factors impacting their vulnerability while serving as a venue for highlighting the work of early stage investigators including underrepresented minorities. Very few national conferences feature representatives of these groups in such a prominent role, drawing together researchers who may not otherwise have such opportunities. The format of this meeting will enable considerable dialogue among the stakeholders to maximize the effectiveness of strategies to advance the field and promote mentoring and development of early stage and under-represented investigators. HIV and Women 2019 will continue to provide major support to provide for scholarships, networking support and opportunities early stage investigators and underrepresented minorities to attend as participants through travel early stage investigator focused oral and poster presentations, mentoring activities, and sessions with senior leaders in the field. Women and HIV 2019is hosted by the Chicago-based Third Coast CFAR (TC-CFAR), which is located at Northwestern University and the University of Chicago. The 3 research themes of HIV and Women 2019 will focus on 1) acquisition; transgender The impact of hormonal contraceptive on HIV 2) Sex differences in long-acting ART formulations; and 3) Optimizing PrEP for men, women, and populations.All sessions will integrate areas of basic, clinical and social and behavioral sciences in invited talks. Panel discussions will be held at the end of the invited talks (30 minutes) and selected abstracts (15 minutes). To keep the sessions on track and guide the panel discussions, a senior investigator will be paired with a junior level investigator and a community representative to lead each session. The panels will clarify key questions and develop future research strategies that will advance the field. Opportunities for informal networking between junior and senior investigators in the field will be provided throughout the meeting including networking and mentoring lunch with breakout topics, a networking mixer/dinner with the poster session on the first evening. These networking opportunities will be complemented by a mentoring focused session that will highlight grant preparation advice, current NIH funding priorities and opportunities, and CFAR- related resources available to facilitate women's focused research. Outcomes from past conferences include new collaborations and innovative approaches, faculty appointments/promotions and funded grant applications. This is the 6th version of this successful symposia organized by the Inter-CFAR Collaboration on HIV Research in Women working group that will guide women new strategies for future research on HIV-related issues unique to while promoting career development among early career investigators. Project Narrative Despite the prevalence of HIV in women and the challenges of successful treatment and prevention programs in this population, significant barriers remain to understanding the gender specific aspects of the impact of HIV in women.

"Biomarkers for Severity, Therapy, and Disparity in Sarcoidosis: Discovery to Delivery Abstract Sarcoidosis is a multi-system disease of unknown cause characterized by noncaseating granulomatous inflammation that results in symptoms and organ dysfunction due to persistent inflammation and fibrosis. It predominately affects the lungs in over 90% of patients, but can injure any organ in the body, and disproportionately African Americans and women in prevalence and severity. At this time, there are no reliable, well-validated biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, response to therapy, or for specific vital organ involvement such as cardiac sarcoidosis. Therefore, to move the field forward, there is a critical need to discover and validate biomarkers for diagnosis, extent of organ involvement, and progression of disease. The annual conference for the Americas Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders (AASOG) is the only meeting specifically devoted to the scientific understanding of the pathophysiology, as well as the diagnosis and clinical management of sarcoidosis. The meeting, entitled “Biomarkers for Severity, Disparity, and Therapy in Sarcoidosis: Discovery to Delivery” will be held at the University of Iowa April 12-13, 2019 and focus on development and testing of novel biomarkers for diagnosis prediction of disparate outcomes in underserved populations. The meeting program includes lectures and discussion by high level basic, translational, and clinical scientists. The meeting will also focus on faculty development of women and promote the training of junior faculty in the field. The specific aims of the conference are as follows: 1. To assemble high-level scientists and investigators in order to discuss current challenges and limitations to progress in the disease, and discuss methods that would lead to discovery of biomarkers that could predict or identify cause, pathogenesis, and response to therapy in any one individual patient. 2. Discuss how discovery and development of new biomarkers may enhance the delivery of care in disparate populations known to be afflicted with greater severity in sarcoidosis. 3. Provide a forum for collaboration and networking of investigators across the spectrum of basic science and clinical investigations, as well as different specialties, to develop future multi-center translational research. 4. To assemble a venue in which junior investigators, postdoctoral fellows, and students can present research, gain visibility, and attain mentorship in in the field of sarcoidosis. 5. Foster the development of women as scientists and academic faculty in the field of sarcoidosis. Project Narrative Sarcoidosis is a multi-system disease of unknown cause characterized by noncaseating granulomatous inflammation that results in symptoms and organ dysfunction due to persistent inflammation and fibrosis, with disproportionate morbidity in African Americans and women. There have been few research advances over the past decades that have led to decreased burden of disease. The 2019 conference of the Americas Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders (AASOG) will convene at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa in order to bring together world-class scientists and physicians to discuss the discovery and use of biomarkers in changing clinical management of sarcoidosis.","Biomarkers for Severity, Therapy, and Disparity in Sarcoidosis: Discovery to Delivery",9762279,R13HL147505,"['Cardiac Sarcoidosis ', ' Scientist ', ' Granulomatous ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' Blindness ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Neurologic Deficit ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' response ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' respiratory insufficiency/failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' Symptoms ', ' Treatment/Psychosocial Effects ', ' Psychosocial Effect ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' cirrhotic ', ' treatment trial ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' injured ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Center for Translational Science Activities ', ' translational sciences center ', ' translational research center ', ' clinical care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' teacher development ', ' instructor training ', ' faculty professional development ', ' faculty development ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' clinical investigation ', ' individual patient ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' side effect ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Affect ', ' Americas ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Faculty ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Iowa ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' lung fibrosis ', ' Pulmonary Fibrosis ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', "" Schaumann's Disease "", "" Boeck's Sarcoid "", ' Besnier-Boeck Disease ', ' Sarcoidosis ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Collaborations ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R13,2019,10000,0.02971017273538513
"Interdisciplinary Aging Research to Address Health Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) Abstract The United States has invested significant resources through innovative research to address the profound effects of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADRD) on families and society, but older adults from historically underrepresented minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged adults (herein, older minorities) have not experienced the full benefits of scientific advances from that research. For example, older minorities live more years with undiagnosed disorders, endure a higher number of functional disabilities, have fewer treatment options, and experience higher levels of stigma. Hindering innovation and dissemination of approaches to ADRD health disparities research is the lack of a highly trained, interdisciplinary scientific workforce that addresses the full range of biological, biomedical, behavioral, and health sciences supported by NIH. This two-installment conference series will bring together emerging investigators from across the US to address the National Alzheimer Project Act (NAPA) 2017 goal of prevention and effective treatment of ADRD by 2025 as well as the National Institute on Aging Health Disparities Framework and NAPA's strategy (1.B) to address health disparities that influence ADRD health outcomes among older minorities. An essential feature of the series will be to engage community stakeholders (persons with ADRD, family caregivers, providers) in multiple aspects of the conference design, planning and implementation including the selection of scholars, providing feedback on conference presentations, and dissemination. Planning, implementation, participation and evaluation of the conference will incorporate individuals from historically underrepresented groups. The aims of the conference series are: (1) to examine existing research on ADRD health disparities and older minorities particularly in the epidemiology, etiology, identification, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of ADRD in the US; (2) to examine existing research studies intended to address multi-level factors that influence the health of persons with ADRD and family caregivers from diverse communities; (3) to develop the research careers of a diverse, highly trained, interdisciplinary team-based scientific workforce specializing in the diversity of experiences of older minorities and their families affected by ADRD; (4) to generate highly tailored, innovative, rigorous, team-based scientific proposals lead by the scholars cohort on ADRD health disparities; (5) to facilitate intensive mentoring and early engagement of emerging scholars in ADRD disparities research using a multi-mentor, multi-disciplinary team science approach; and (6) to create opportunities for community stakeholders, the scientific community, NIH directors and/or program officers to leverage collaborations in multi-investigator and multi-disciplinary projects. Project Narrative/Relevance: This 3-day conference will (1) address environmental, sociocultural, behavioral, and biological disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias that affect millions of older minorities and their family caregivers; and (2) serve as an incubator of scientific network of interdisciplinary scholars specializing in rigorous team- based approaches to close the ADRD health disparities gap.",Interdisciplinary Aging Research to Address Health Disparities in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD),9900702,R13AG063477,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incubators ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Societies ', ' United States ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Sensory ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Sentinel ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Motor ', ' Research Training ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' AD prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' care costs ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R13,2020,50000,0.005506618589148325
"HIV Research for Prevention Conference, HIVR4P 2020 Project Summary Epidemic control of HIV is feasible but only if we substantially strengthen our primary prevention efforts in adolescents and adults at risk and ensure the development of next-generation prevention methods. While much progress has been made in expanding effective biomedical prevention and in complementary behavioral and structural approaches, new infections in some groups and geographies, including in the United States, are not declining but are on the rise. With the results of up to five efficacy trials of new prevention technologies expected in 2020/21, the prevention field will face difficult decisions, skeptical and overburdened implementation audiences, and questioning communities. Against this background, the HIV Research for Prevention Conference 2020 (HIVR4P 2020) will be the key global scientific convening to reflect on the state of HIV prevention, recalibrate priorities, and map out a workplan for the coming decade. The conference will critically assess the latest research results in vaccine development, monoclonal antibody interventions, PrEP and other ARV-based approaches, long-acting and depot formulations, other novel prevention modalities, and relevant implementation science. Taking place in Cape Town, South Africa, on 11 to 15 October 2020, HIVR4P 2020 will have an attendance of 1,400 delegates from more than 50 countries. South Africa continues to play a significant role in product development and testing in cooperation with the United States. Attending HIVR4P in Cape Town will thus offer delegates the opportunity to benefit from learning about the successes and challenges in this critical setting while engaging in a broad scientific and policy exchange between specialists from the U.S, Europe, Asia and other regions with their African peers. The specific aims of HIVR4P 2020 are to: 1. Convene the world’s experts in HIV prevention and related fields to advance scientific knowledge, present  new research findings, and enhance global scientific and community collaborations; 2. Advance evidence-informed and human rights-based HIV prevention that is tailored to the needs of  particularly at risk and vulnerable groups to reduce health disparities including: adolescents and young  adults, women and girls in high-burden settings, displaced populations, men who have sex with men,  prisoners and other incarcerated people, people who use drugs, sex workers, and transgender people; 3. Refine HIV prevention research agendas to reflect identified opportunities and knowledge gaps, including:  next generation of HIV vaccines and bNAbs; smarter delivery systems for molecules, including longer-  acting and multi-purpose technologies; challenges and opportunities of further PrEP roll-out ad long-term  PrEP use; integrated sexually transmitted infections (STI) and HIV prevention within broader sexual and  reproductive health approaches; HIV prevention in the context of changing patterns of opioid use; and  integrated prevention agendas that cut across disease and risk areas. The scientific program will be structured along five thematic areas: Basic science; PrEP and ARV-based prevention; Vaccines and bNAbs clinical trials; Other prevention modalities and cross-cutting issues; and Applied and implementation science. Cross-cutting aspects will be highlighted in plenary talks that also connect the scientific tracks with community and leadership perspectives. The participation of young researchers, basic scientists and researchers in related fields will be strengthened by active solicitation of relevant science and the provision of specific financial support. Free remote access to conference presentations and posters and robust social media dissemination will ensure reach beyond those able to attend in person and join the discussions on site. Project Narrative HIVR4P 2020 will be held from 11-15 October 2020 in Cape Town, South Africa, with an expected attendance of 1,400 delegates. The conference will be the key convening of prevention scientists, clinicians, advocates, policy makers, private sector partners, and public health experts to review the latest biomedical, behavioral and structural prevention evidence from a transdisciplinary perspective and consider the implications for the future AIDS response.

"2021 National LGBTQ Health Conference: Bridging Research and Practice The 2021 National LGBTQ Health Conference will bring together leading researchers and practitioners, trainees and students to bridge research and practice to address health disparities for sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. This proposal requests funding for a 3-day conference in Chicago for the 7th National LGBTQ Health Conference. This conference has been successfully hosted in Chicago since 2012 by the conference founders, the Northwestern Institute for Sexual and Gender Minority Health and Wellbeing (ISGMH) and Center on Halsted (COH). Given that the southern US is disproportionately impacted by HIV, STDs and SGM health disparities, in 2019 ISGMH and COH recruited Emory University to jointly organize the 2019 conference in Atlanta. In 2021, the Conference will be hosted again in Chicago and will be planned jointly by ISGMH at Northwestern, COH and Emory. The 2021 conference will build on the previous successful conferences and will continue to increase its national visibility, its academic-community partnerships and its focus on including underrepresented minorities in the planning, execution and reach of the conference. The conference aims to improve both research and practice on SGM health by convening an interprofessional audience to present and discuss cutting-edge translational findings in the field; to train the next generation of practitioners and researchers in SGM health; and to disseminate the findings broadly to the general public, policymakers, and SGM communities nationwide in addition to academics, clinicians and service providers. A major goal of the conference is to increase participation by traditionally underrepresented groups in science, including women and transgender people, racial/ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. The overall goal of this conference is to catalyze research to reduce and eliminate health disparities among SGM people. These disparities are severe and affect life expectancy, mental and physical health, access to and quality of care, and overall quality of life. Critical disparities are found in risk and incidence of mental health issues including suicide, substance abuse, cancer, HIV and other STIs and are linked to minority status, stigma, discrimination, and denial of human and civil rights. As is the case among other minorities experiencing disparities, these disparities are not born equally among all SGM people: transgender people, SGM people of color and low-income people bear a disproportionate burden of these disparities. The proposed 2021 National LGBTQ Health Conference is a unique opportunity to gather the best knowledge and practice in the field through an intersectional lens to improve the lives of all SGM people. The 2021 National LGBTQ Health Conference will bring together leading researchers and practitioners, as well as trainees and students, to address health inequalities and disparities in the LGBTQ population and improve the lives of all LGBTQ people through an intersectional lens.",2021 National LGBTQ Health Conference: Bridging Research and Practice,10070917,R13MD015672,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Civil Rights ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Human Rights ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest US ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social Discrimination ', ' Students ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' interest ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Research Training ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' minority health ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' evidence base ', ' HIV/STI ', ' STD/HIV ', ' STI/HIV ', ' HIV/STD ', ' health inequalities ', ' same-sex marriage ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' social media ', ' training opportunity ', ' community partnership ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' minority communities ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' service providers ', ' LGBTQ ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R13,2020,50000,0.20630130894683485
"International Conference on Cancer Health Disparities The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), the second largest Hispanic-serving institution in the nation, has a special focus on health disparities. The UTRGV founded the School of Medicine (SOM) in 2015 to serve as an educational, clinical, and research facility for the highly underserved populations along the US- Mexico border. As part of its mission, in 2017 the SOM began hosting an annual Research Symposium on health disparities, the first of its kind in the Rio Grande Valley and one in which over half the participants are minorities and women. Considering enthusiastic participation from US and Mexico border institutions, the UTRGV-SOM plans to host the “International Conference on Cancer Health Disparities” in September 2020. This International Conference will be expanded to take advantage of the opportunity for continued medical education for our diverse populations and to continue emphasis on minority health and cancer health disparities in US-Mexico border areas. This conference complements well the mission of the AACR Annual and AACR cancer health disparity meetings. To date, UTRGV has successfully held three research symposia with 300 attendees each year. Meetings include a nationally known keynote speaker, six plenary sessions, abstracts and posters presented by students, researchers, fellows, faculty and their colleagues from neighboring border institutions. UTRGV-SOM respectfully requests support from the NIH NCI for the 4th Annual Research Symposium entitled “International Conference on Cancer Health Disparities,” to be held from September 11-12, 2020. NIH funds will be used to invite topnotch cancer health disparity researchers and young scientists (competitive basis) from national and international institutions, including third-world countries. Funds will also be used to successfully implement our scientific agenda over two days, showcasing collaborative community-engaged research where researchers, practitioners, and community partners address global cancer health disparities in underserved populations. This International Conference also closely aligns with the mission of the NCI (NCI Global Health Center) and NIMHD, that is, to support global cancer research and cancer health disparity research to advance scientific knowledge and help all people live longer and maintain a high-quality lifestyle.

"What is the joint contribution of environmental and social determinants of health in explaining health and disease over the life course? Building the field and identifying research priorities. Project Summary / Abstract Interdisciplinary research that focuses on combined exposures to social and environmental factors and their effect on health and wellbeing is urgently necessary as working from a single discipline could be resulting in underestimated health risks, unidentified vulnerable populations, and missed opportunities for prevention and intervention. To support the development of a community of scientists interested in this interdisciplinary research field and that in turn enables this field to grow a two-day conference will be held in Portland, OR (October 2020) titled “The joint contribution of environmental and social determinants of health in explaining health and disease over the life course: Building the field and identifying research priorities.” The first day of the conference will be dedicated to reviewing advancements in socio-environmental health research, starting with a keynote address and plenary presentations from notable figures in this research fields. Invited presentations by attendees will work from a developmental origin of health and disease (DOHaD) framework and discuss how social and environmental exposures occurring during critical periods of development (e.g., prenatal, early life) can jointly influence health and health disparity over the life course (Aim 1). The second day of the conference will include a plenary presentation on current methodological challenges in this field and roundtable discussions to discuss the state of the science, gaps and opportunities to move the field forward (Aim 2). On the afternoon of the second day of the conference, two technical assistance workshops will be offered to all conference attendees and a business meeting for a select group of experts and leaders will be held. The technical assistance sessions will review fundamental methodological and analytic approaches related to: (1) rigorous measurement of psychosocial stress and social determinants of health (target audience: environmental health scientists), and (2) survey of environmental toxicants, health effects, and biomarkers of exposure (target audience: social scientists) (Aim 2). During the business meeting a task force in charge of finding a long-term meeting “home” for our community of socio-environmental researchers will be formalized (Aim 3). In the long term, activities of this conference will work to formally establish a scientific community committed to increasing our understanding of how overlapping exposure to environmental and social factors affects health and wellbeing across the lifespan. This community will champion the development and implementation of robust scientific methodologies, will procure the integration of diverse perspectives into the scientific discussion of our area of focus, and will delineate research priorities that respond to the challenges of those most affected by adverse social and environmental conditions. The formation of this community will also ensure there is a dedicated platform through which dissemination and collaboration occur for years to come. Project Narrative Despite a common overlap of social and environmental determinants of health – particularly among socially disadvantaged populations- researchers continue to predominately study these two sets of exposures separately, which in turn may lead to underestimated health outcomes and unidentified vulnerable groups. To increase the pace of research focused on joint exposures to social and environmental determinants of health, we are convening a scientific conference on October 2020 in Portland OR to discuss the state of the science, identify gaps, delineate priorities, discuss and share methodologies, and explore collaborations. In this the second meeting of an emerging community of socio-environmental health scientists we will also launch a search for a permanent meeting home to accelerate the growth of discovery in this field and ultimately the impact of our findings on the nation’s public health.",What is the joint contribution of environmental and social determinants of health in explaining health and disease over the life course?

"ADAR Summit Meeting PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Creating experiences for underrepresented undergraduates in STEM fields where they can present their own research and experience a professional setting is important for developing their sense of self, and ability to persevere in a research career. Sharing one's research is an important step in that process. The proposed ADAR Summit meeting provides the financial support to make this happen for trainees in the MSTEM Advancing Diversity in Aging Research program. The proposed series of conferences will meet annually for five years, coinciding with the annual meeting of the Gerontological Society of America (GSA). There are 9 such programs currently. Each one has a different emphasis in the field of aging: biology, psychology, demography and more. As part of the ADAR program, students engage in mentored research projects in the field of aging. These projects will be presented at the conference either as presentations in the ADAR Summit meeting, or as part of a poster session within the broader GSA conference setting. The GSA will facilitate an integration of the ADAR Summit into the program. In each year in the ADAR Summit, there will be student presentations, presentations from established URM and other scholars, opportunities to speak with representatives from possible graduate schools, and networking time with the trainees from other institutions. The program will have different kinds of activities in order to fully engage the undergraduate students, including visiting the poster sessions in the GSA, attending sessions relevant to their field, and the book exhibits. In addition, the MSTEM ADAR program requires PIs to meet annually to discuss best practices, share advice and other experiences. The PIs will have time to meet for this purpose. As such, the primary goal of this conference series is to help solidify the self-image of trainees as STEM researchers in aging through positive reinforcement. The ADAR Summit is an important strategy for retention in budding research careers. Ultimately the goal is to have a research community of scientists that is representative of the overall United States population, in order to more accurately address health issues of the 21st century and beyond.

"Evaluating Deliberative Democracy Approaches with Citizens of African Ancestry Regarding Population Screening for Hereditary Cancer Syndromes PROJECT SUMMARY Several national organizations concur that population screening to identify individuals and families at highest risk for inherited cancer syndromes is warranted. Low cost genetic risk screening tools are available for several inherited cancer syndromes including heredity breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Nonetheless, evidence suggests that early translation efforts to get these cancer genetic services into the hands of underrepresented minority populations are not overcoming existing disparity propensities. Most research has focused on tweaking existing service delivery strategies (e.g., activated providers, telegenetics), but these efforts have not shown consistent improvement in service uptake among those of African ancestry (AAn). Research has yet to enlist communities of AAn to thoughtfully consider whether expanding HBOC screening is in the interest of the common good and warranted to redress their poor cancer outcomes. Democratic deliberation (DD) approaches can offer a way to engage communities of AAn to consider whether and how screening for HBOC should be expanded. We propose to evaluate the feasibility and quality of the DD process in a region serving large communities of AAn in south Georgia. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Use DD methods to plan a citizen deliberation conference for south Georgia residents of AAn concerning HBOC population screening and develop the following: participant workbook, expert presentations, output evaluation procedures, facilitator training protocols, and recruitment plans. Aim 2: Conduct and evaluate a 2-day deliberative conference in Albany, Georgia with 25 participants to: (a) become aware of different viewpoints surrounding HBOC population screening, (b) support large- and small-group deliberation on these viewpoints, and (c) reach consensus on what approach for HBOC screening among communities of AAn, if any, is in the common good. Primary outcomes are quality of the deliberation process as indicated by recorded small-group deliberations, and impacts on participants. Aim 2a: Conduct a 3-month follow-up online deliberation with a larger panel, to gain insight into the external validity of the output of the DD conference (acceptability of, and agreement with, the consensus reached relating to HBOC population screening in Georgia). Results of this pilot study will inform the development of future larger grant. We plan to evaluate DD approaches for HBOC screening across the state of Georgia. The efforts will include us gaining the input of health care providers and policy makers to consider whether to expand population-based HBOC screening among communities of AAn. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop and evaluate the feasibility and quality of a democratic deliberation (DD) approach for eliciting informed community perspectives on whether and how screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) should be expanded in an area serving a large community of African Ancestry (AAn) in south Georgia.

"National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference Abstract  ‐ This proposal is for renewal of the National Hispanic Science Network (NHSN) Annual Conference grant (R13 DA026647), to support five three day, stand-alone conferences. The NHSN is dedicated to improving health equity of Hispanics by increasing the amount, quality, and dissemination of interdisciplinary translational research and fostering the development, advancement, and promotion of future Hispanic scientists and leaders. The NHSN conference assembles members of the global research community focused on different aspects of substance use disorder including epidemiology, toxicology, environmental health, intervention science, psychology, sociology, health policy, and neurobiology as it pertains to Hispanic populations. The NHSN conference is unique in that it serves as a forum for transdisciplinary scientific discourse spanning from basic neuroscience to implementation science and policy. The NHSN conference serves as a venue for mentoring, networking, and professional development of scientists underrepresented in their respective disciplines. Because many of the sociocultural factors and comorbid conditions relevant to Hispanic communities are shared with other underrepresented minority (URM) populations, our goal is to expand the scope of the conference (on alternate years) to include African-American, Asian-American, and Native-American workgroup participation. The proposed yearly conferences will continue to serve as the unique venue for transdisciplinary and interprofessional scientific discussions on strategies towards minimizing the impact of substance use disorders and their comorbidities on health disparities in Hispanics and other URMs. In addition, the conferences will continue to foster recruitment, retention, development, and advancement of Hispanic scientists to promote future leaders in substance use disorder research and related areas. The NHSN conference is an opportunity for trainees of diverse gender, ethnicity, discipline, and geographic location to come together and participate in a multidisciplinary scientific meeting, establish peer support groups, and develop professional relationships that provide venues for innovative developments in the field. Project Narrative Underrepresented minority groups are disproportionately impacted by substance use disorder, and Hispanics (the largest racial/ethnic minority population in the United States) are overrepresented in the total number of individuals affected by substance use disorder. Hispanics are also underrepresented in biomedical, socio- behavioral, and implementation science disciplines, and the lack of Hispanic representation in these disciplines contributes to health disparities as they pertain to substance use and related comorbidities. The annual National Hispanic Science Network (NHSN) conference is the premier venue for transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and interprofessional scientific discussions on strategies to minimize the impact of substance use disorder on health disparities in Hispanics and other underrepresented minority groups as well as for promoting and strengthening Hispanic interdisciplinary social professional networks to address the disparities.",National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference,9895692,R13DA026647,"['Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Fertilization ', ' Fertility/Fertilization ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Mentors ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' Support Groups ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Sociology ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' falls ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Discipline ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Native Americans ', ' Genetic ', ' Research Priority ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Community Practice ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Science Policy ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' dissemination research ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' health equity ', ' Hispanic Graduate Student ', ' career fair ', ' professional networking ', ' speed networking ', ' career networking ', ' peer support ', ' recruit ', ' social factors ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIDA,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R13,2020,75000,0.021037025802009304

"Time Use Across the Life Course: Multigenerational Family Health and Well-Being Project Summary This proposal requests five years of support for two biennial conferences on intersections of time use, family inequality, and well-being. The proposal builds on the 10 year history of successful time use conferences sponsored by the Maryland Population Research Center and co-organized by faculty from the Departments of Sociology and Economics and the School of Public Health. The aims of the proposal are to 1) offer a forum for dialogue among senior and new time use, public health, and social and social and behavioral science scholars on innovative research on time use and child and family well-being across diverse families; 2) Identify emerging issues in how life course variation in time use patterns is linked with developmental and role transitions and adult and family well-being, emphasizing differences by gender, race-ethnicity, and education; 3) Foster interdisciplinary and international research teams who will develop pioneering projects on emerging issues identified in Aim 2; and 4) Facilitate translational research projects that apply knowledge about how time use variation across the life course and by gender, parenthood, race-ethnicity, and education influences well- being to identify ways to improve effectiveness and scope of related programs and policies. To address these aims, the proposed three biennial conferences are designed to provide a forum for dialogue about integrating time use data with cross-disciplinary perspectives and tools on life course research and provide opportunities for the formation of new interdisciplinary teams and increasing the number of scholars from underrepresented groups applying time use data to emerging time-use-related social issues. Relevance Changes in family structure, living arrangements and population aging are altering life course work and family trajectories, time transfers up and down the generational ladder, and social integration. Time diary surveys provide reliable, detailed, and comparable data on how family and social change influence children and adult’s social integration, economic participation and health-related behaviors (e.g. eating, sleep, leisure). Time diary data can be used to examine how work and leisure activities are associated with stress and enjoyment, as well as the formation of cognitive, physical, economic, and social capital and, with GPS integration, daily exposure to environmental stressors like pollution, high-crime areas, and food deserts.",Time Use Across the Life Course: Multigenerational Family Health and Well-Being,9920733,R13HD088085,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Crime ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Institutes ', ' Leisure Activities ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Maryland ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Change ', ' Social modification ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Sociology ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Leisures ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Employment Status ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' environmental stressor ', ' social integration ', ' intergenerational ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' Structure ', ' family structure ', ' social ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R13,2020,6000,0.042238020967905215

Four invited keynotes highlight the conference theme of living well with cancer: 1) Dr. Jeffrey White, director of the NCI Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM) on current and future priorities and plans for investment in research on the science of living well with cancer; 2) Dr. Mary Armanios on the intersection of aging and cancer and will illuminate the interplay of telomere length and tumor growth to provide the biological context for understanding the role of integrative therapies 3) Dr. Bonnie Kaplan on the role of nutrition and micronutrients on mental health and resilience in cancer and other populations, and; 4) Dr. Otis Brawly on the growing body of evidence showing that sociological and demographic disparities, rather than race-related biological differences, largely explain cancer inequalities, directly leading to impaired quality of life in minority groups. The conference will also include invited plenary panels focusing on the current state of IO science for: 1) integrative therapies for living well with advanced cancer, 2) complementary therapies for older cancer patients and 3) IO for adolescents and young adults. Members will submit abstracts for peer-reviewed selection for workshops, poster sessions, oral paper sessions and symposia. We anticipate attendance of over 400 participants from around the world.  The conference's specific aims are to: 1) create an international forum in which researchers, clinicians, trainees, and patient advocates can discuss the current evidence for the interplay of integrative oncology research and clinical application to enhance their understanding of the advantages and challenges of the field; 2) foster critical dialogue and collaboration opportunities among researchers, health professionals, and patient advocates to strengthen the translational potential and clinical relevance of future research in integrative oncology; and 3) support the training of early investigators and patient advocates to interpret, develop, disseminate, and implement evidence-based integrative oncology research. The Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO) 17th International Conference, ""The Science of Living Well with Cancer”, will enable and encourage scientific and clinical collaboration across global and professional boundaries to advance the knowledge, therapies, and care delivery of integrative oncology to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes. This conference will also continue to emphasize the training of early career investigators and patient advocates in creating, interpreting, disseminating and implementing evidence-based integrative oncology research, and increasing its potential clinical utility. Ultimately, it is our hope that this conference will provide renewed knowledge of the evidence-based science of living well with cancer, and motivate researchers and clinicians to elevate this work in order to improve patient care outcomes for individuals and their families living with cancer worldwide.","The Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO) 17th International Conference, ""The Science of Living Well With Cancer""",10070810,R13CA254452,"['Aging ', ' Baltimore ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' nutrition ', ' Paper ', ' Patient advocacy ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Sociology ', ' Training Support ', ' Work ', ' telomere ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Inequality ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Micronutrients ', ' Knowledge ', ' posters ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' Stream ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' tumor growth ', ' care delivery ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' body-mind ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Complementary treatment ', ' Complementary therapies ', ' Complementary and alternative medicine ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Advocate ', ' International ', ' MSKCC ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' next generation ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' person centered ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' translational approach ', ' knowledge translation ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' Natural Products ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Integrative Treatment ', ' Integrative Therapy ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R13,2020,15000,0.026180592221402475
"Igniting Hope: Mobilizing Community Resources to Achieve Health Equity 2020 Good health is not shared equally among the residents of New York State. Health disparities between Blacks and Whites are particularly evident in the city of Buffalo (population 258,000, Buffalo Niagara region 1.13 million), which is among the poorest cities in the US with 31% living in poverty, leading to significant health disparities. The life expectancy of African Americans, who make up 39% of Buffalo residents, is 12 years shorter compared to that of White residents of Buffalo. Much of this health inequity results from social determinants of health, which include underdeveloped neighborhoods, failing schools, high unemployment, low property values, poor access to public transportation, food deserts, lead contamination in homes, and poor access to healthcare.  In partnership with the African American Health Equity Task Force (AAHETF), we propose to conduct an annual community-based multidisciplinary conference entitled the Igniting Hope series with a goal to continue the dialogue on developing a strategy, which builds a culture of health as the cornerstone of a plan to end health disparities among African Americans in Buffalo. Led by local pastors and including University at Buffalo faculty from eight schools, advocates, citizens, and healthcare professionals, the AAHETF is an influential community- based group that has made significant progress in bringing awareness to the needs of the community, creating a network, establishing a vision, organizing fund-raising efforts, and beginning the work of disseminating our findings regarding minority health disparities in the region with a focus on the social determinants of health. The audience will include community leaders and stakeholders, university faculty and trainees from multiple disciplines, including medicine, nursing, public health, pharmacy, urban planning, law, education and business. We propose an innovative conference that includes keynote talks by national leaders in health disparities and facilitated breakout sessions. Our goals are to deepen understanding of how social determinants affect health research and health outcomes in the African American community and other underrepresented groups (Aim 1); build on the innovative health intervention strategies that have resulted from the initial conferences to promote research to develop and test innovative solutions for eliminating health disparities (Aim 2); and engage trainees from diverse backgrounds in an interactive conference and follow-up activities to attract the next generation of health equity researchers into the discipline (Aim 3). The conference will be held at the new UB medical school building located in one of the neighborhoods most affected by health disparities. The proposed conference will educate faculty, trainees and the community; foster new collaborations; and will be a primary means through which the AAHETF will take a leadership role to have a true impact on health disparities in our region. Striking health disparities between Blacks and Whites are present in the city of Buffalo, which is among the poorest cities in the US with 31% living in poverty and 50% underrepresented minority.

"Health Disparities in Alzheimers and Related Diseases This application from Florida International University (FIU) and Emory University requests support for a four-year research conference series to address critical scientific issues associated with reducing Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) inequities among ethnic minorities in the United States. The conference series we propose rests on interdisciplinary research using a population disease framework, with specific attention to ethnic groups and sex differences in pathways to neurodegenerative diseases. Genetics and family/personal health histories are non-modifiable factors, and modifiable factors include a wide range of lifespan environmental exposures and lifestyle factors. The conference series focuses on increasing understanding about how genetic factors are operating in concert with environmental exposures, family and personal health histories, and lifestyle factors to produce interactions that enhance or mitigate risk of ADRD within and between ethnic groups, specifically among African Americans, Latinos, and non-Latino Whites. These critical issues remain largely overlooked and are fundamental for increasing knowledge for disease modification using precision medicine and for pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic intervention development in under-represented populations in AD clinical trials. The 4 related specific aims of the series are: 1. To understand how the current evidence examines specific genes, individually or in combination, are differentially distributed by ethnicity and sex, and are associated with higher risk or protection against LOAD between and among higher risk ethnic groups. 2. To describe how genetic risk may be modulated by factors such as epigenetics, age, sex, environmental exposures, lifestyle/diet, family and personal health histories, social, and demographic factors between and within ethnic groups and women at disproportionate risk for LOAD. 3. To examine current knowledge about how comorbidities such as vascular diseases, diabetes, and mental health moderate or mediate the increase risk of ADRD in these under-represented populations. 4. To explore underlying theory, new findings, and innovative observation, instrument development and calibration for respondent or patient assessment, and measurement/analytic strategies to improve our understanding of the gene x environment interactions influencing ADRD risk and how methods may be modified or adapted for use in specific research applications with higher risk minority populations and women. Narrative: This proposed 4-series Conference is highly relevant to public health issues related to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). The series will serve as a forum to bring together an interdisciplinary group of clinicians, scientists and the community to develop a population disease framework related to unique factors related to the susceptibility of minority populations to ADRD. Focus will include genetic, environmental, lifestyle and sociodemographic factors will the goal of understanding how genetic factors interact with these other factors to enhance risk of ADRD within and between minorities.",Health Disparities in Alzheimers and Related Diseases,10070996,R13AG069380,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calibration ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Florida ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Morbidity -

"14th International Conference on HIV Treatment, Pathogenesis, and Prevention Research (INTEREST) Abstract.  The most recent UNAIDS estimates of the global burden of HIV are that 36.9 million people are living with HIV-1 infection worldwide, with 69.4% of these residing in sub-Saharan Africa. Markedly, three in four new infections in sub-Saharan Africa are among girls aged 15–19 years and young women aged 15–24 years are twice as likely to be living with HIV than men that age. Further, a striking difference exists between the east/southern and the west/central regions of sub-Saharan Africa, with reductions in AIDS-related deaths since 2010 of 42% and 24%, respectively. Clearly, much work remains in terms of training local physicians and scientists in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of individuals with HIV-1 infection; conducting implementation science to determine the most cost-effective use of financial and human resources; and ensuring evidence-informed public health policy and programming to reduce disparities in the AIDS response across Africa’s sub-regions. Despite treatment likely having contributed to slowing HIV transmission, HIV prevention remains critical to stem the tide of HIV. In fact, a second AIDS pandemic in the next 12 years is predicted due to 1) changing demographics in Africa with increasing numbers of youth, 2) increasing transmitted viral drug resistance, and 3) increased cost and limited availability of 2nd and 3rd line treatment regimens. Taken together, these factors suggest that the total number of people living with AIDS may increase by 2 million/year to reach a staggering 50 million worldwide by 2030.  Since 2007, 13 successful annual INTEREST Conferences, known as the ‘African CROI’, have brought together scientists involved in HIV diagnosis and treatment, pathogenesis, and prevention research in resource-limited settings in Africa to share pivotal findings, promote collaboration, and transfer experiences across several fields and many continents. Planning and organization of the 2020 INTEREST Conference will be overseen by the Amsterdam Institute of Global Health and Development. Catherine Hankins MD PhD chairs INTEREST’s International Conference Committee (ICC) and is the Scientific Chair of INTEREST.  The organizers of the 2020 INTEREST Conference will pursue the following objectives: 1) To provide cutting-edge knowledge in the fields of diagnosis and treatment, pathogenesis,  and prevention of HIV-1 for adults, including the elderly; adolescents; and children living with  HIV in Africa, in order to contribute to achieving the 90-90-90 viral suppression goal and to  preventing a second great pandemic. 2) To foster new research interactions among leading investigators and those who represent the  potential future scientific leadership for health care and research on the African continent. Project Narrative. Currents efforts are ramping up to control local HIV epidemics in Africa by providing effective treatment and prevention strategies for people living with HIV-1 infection. The 2020 INTEREST Conference will focus on the scientific training and capacity building of young African clinicians and scientists whose scope of work is to implement and evaluate evidence-based: 1) early diagnosis and clinical care for HIV-1 infection, 2) effective antiretroviral treatment, and 3) tailored prevention strategies. Moreover, the three-day INTEREST conference, which profiles state-of-the-art science, will support the career development of young African clinicians and scientists by: 1) fostering local and international scientific exchange; 2) providing opportunities to present their results; and 3) facilitating their close interaction with scientific peers and invited international experts to explore career choices and opportunities for scientific collaboration.","14th International Conference on HIV Treatment, Pathogenesis, and Prevention Research (INTEREST)",10012378,R13AI152885,"['Acquired

"AACR Conference on The Science of Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed conference series, titled “The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,” will be held annually in the fall (2019-2023). The 2019 conference will be held September 20-23, 2019 in San Francisco, California. The locations of the 2020-2023 conferences remain to be selected, but will be chosen based upon the future needs and growth of the conference series. This proposed conference series will be the 12th-16th in an AACR series focused specifically on the science of cancer health disparities. The first conference on The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved was held in 2007, then annually from 2009-2018. While most conferences on cancer health disparities focus on policy and public health issues, the goal of this conference is to incorporate perspectives from basic scientists and clinicians in conjunction with policy and public health. Transdisciplinary interactions between a variety of disciplines, including basic science, clinical research, population science, behavioral research, and cancer survivorship, are needed to move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating disparities as they relate to cancer. Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer rates are well documented. While data suggest that differing levels of access to quality care contribute to cancer disparities, other factors also play a role, including tumor biology, genetics, hormonal status, lifestyle and behavior, screening policies, comorbidities, environmental exposure and risk, quality of and response to therapy, and post-therapeutic surveillance. The goal of this conference and the conference series is to bring together scientists and other professionals working in a variety of disciplines to discuss the latest findings in the field and to stimulate the development of new research in cancer health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer incidence and death statistics show that certain racial and ethnic groups in the United States suffer disproportionately from cancer and its associated effects. These disparities may be explained by socioeconomic and cultural factors, biological basis, differences in hormonal status and genetic variants, or differences in inherited susceptibilities and molecular pathways for pathogenesis. Over the next 5 years, this conference will continue to bring together basic scientists, physicians, behavioral researchers, population researchers, and other health professionals to foster discussions and collaborations between early-career and senior scientists, moving the field forward, and continue to make progress in reducing and eliminating cancer health disparities.",AACR Conference on The Science of Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved,9978757,R13CA239609,"['Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Scientist ', ' Location ', ' Hormonal ', ' skills ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Population Sciences ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Science ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Molecular ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' medically underserved ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' racial health disparity ', ' screening policy ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2020,99500,0.16600294472236243
