"LIFE STRESS AND BIOMARKERS AS RELATED TO ASTHMA RISK This project will provide cross-discipline training for the Principal Investigator (PI), cultivating skills and expertise in the epidemiological study of both individual-and community-level life stessors, focusing in particular on how these stressors impact childhood asthma risk.  The PI is trained in pulmonary medicine and has completed a fellowship in respiratory epidemiology at the Channing Laboratory, earning an MPH from the Harvard School of Public Health.  Further training and research will be carried out under the supervision of a multidisciplinary, highly qualified advisory committee of sponsors and co- investigators with expertise in asthma epidemiology, life stress research, developmental and neuropsychological outcomes, immunology, and community-level stress research (i.e., violence epidemiology).  Career development will be enhanced through cross-discipline course work and participation in seminars and national meetings related to stress and respiratory research. This award, along with the PI's clinical and scientific background, will facilitate the development of a successful independent research career with a focus on environmental stress and asthma outcomes.  Etiologies of the rising prevalence and morbidity of asthma, and of the disproportionate burden among urban children, are not well understood.  Differential exposure to life stress may in part explain disparities in disease burden. The role of stress in the expression of asthma is largely unexplored in epidemiological studies.  The overall scientific goal of the proposed studies is to examine the associations between multi-level measures of life stress (i.e., negative life events, perceived stress, neighborhood disadvantage, violence exposure) and asthma outcomes in representative samples of urban children followed prospectively.  We hypothesize that children exposed to high-level stress will be at greater risk for asthma development than children with low-level stress exposure. Furthermore, we hypothesize that high-stress environments will predict greater asthma morbidity (i.e., emergency room visits, hospitalizations).  The influence of stress on T-helper cell differentiation as reflected in cytokine profiles and IgE production (TH2 phenotype) will also be examined.  Additionally, sequelae of environmental stress, such as neuropsychological and behavioral impairments, that may affect health promotion behaviors (i.e., compliance) and result in greater asthma morbidity, will be assessed.  The PI will gain expertise in the epidemiological approach to stress as it relates to asthma risk and will establish a network of long-term collaborative relationships that will enhance the ability to become an established independent investigator.

"SOCIAL FACTORS & THE ENVIRONMENT IN PEDIATRIC ASTHMA   DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigators' Abstract)                                                                                                                      Asthma is an increasingly common, complex condition with rising morbidity and        mortality.  Racial disparities in pediatric asthma prevalence and severity           indicate higher rates among indigent, non-Caucasians living in urban                 communities.  The greatest proportional increase in deaths due to asthma has         occurred in the 10-14 year-old age range.  This proposal studies the racial          disparities in pediatric asthma outcome among low income African American,           Latino, and Caucasian elementary school-aged children.  The goal is to clarify       the biologic and environmental, as well as the social and behavioral,                processes that lead to these disparities.                                                                                                                                 Asthma screening will be done at three sets of six elementary schools as a           service to the schools.  Parents returning the screen will serve as the              population from which three cohorts of elementary school-aged children will be       recruited, one in each of the first three years of the project.  The screen          yields three groups of children in each cohort:  one group that has previously       diagnosed asthma, a second group that has possible, undiagnosed asthma               (positive screens), and a third group that has no evidence of asthma symptoms        (negative screen).  The children screening positive will be followed every six       months for 12 months to obtain three additional points of data.  A random            sample from those who screen negative for asthma will be recruited as a              comparison group for the first data point only.                                                                                                                           Information gathered at the three time points include 1) information on              childhood asthma control (health services utilization and symptoms) and              general physical health, and 2) caregiver life stressors, physical health, and       depression.  Time points 1 and 3 (T1 and T3) are telephone interviews.  Also         at T1, children who screened positive for asthma will have allergy testing at        school for common respiratory allergies.  The interview at time point 2 (T2)         is conducted during a home visit, at which time a home environmental screen is       conducted and two dust samples collected and later analyzed for dust mite,           cockroach, and cat antigens.  Also at T3 (one year after the screening results                                                   are returned), parents will be interviewed about how they made the decision          whether or not to seek care, from whom, and with what success.  Selected             healthcare providers will be sent a questionnaire regarding the children's           care.  All stages of the project include a Community Outreach and Education          Plan, culminating in community meetings in the final year to share results and       consider next steps.

"Adult Asthma--Biology, Society and Environment   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental, biological, and                  psychosocial factors can all separately influence the disease burden in asthma.      As yet, no studies have taken into account all three categories of factors           together, to examine their relative contributions to the disease burden and          investigate whether their cumulative effects can explain the health disparities      of at-risk populations, either additively or synergistically. Asthma is an           ideal chronic condition in which to delineate the potential linkages among           biological mechanisms, social factors, and physical environments and, more           specifically, to show how these linkages may lead to health disparities. Study       Hypotheses: 1) There are socioeconomic status (SES) differentials in the             disease burden of asthma; 2) Environmental, biological, and psychosocial             factors are linked to the asthma disease burden additively, if not                   synergistically; and 3) The variance in SES differentials of disease burden          will be substantially explained by modeling that takes specific environmental,       biological, and psychosocial factors into account. Methods: This proposed study      will make use of an established panel of 590 adults with asthma of varying           severity. We propose to supplement these survey data with 500 home site visits       in which we will directly gather environmental, biological, and psychosocial         data. Specific environmental risk factors we will quantify include: allergen         sensitization, home allergens, ETS exposure, and indoor air quality. We will         also assess perceived stress and social support. In addition, we will link           subjects to other potential exposures through external data sets. We will also       administer a follow-up survey to investigate the combined influence of               environmental, biological, and psychosocial exposures in explaining SES              disparities in the disease burden of asthma. This study combines a                   multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in clinical medicine,           social sciences, epidemiology, psychology, endocrinology, asthma treatment and       prevention, and biostatistics. Anticipated Results and Significance: The             proposed investigation will have sufficient power to detect differences in the       proportions of outcomes between two groups in the range of 10-15 percent at the      0.05 level for dichotomous outcomes. This project addresses a major research         need and can be a basis for the development of public policies to address            environmentally related and other health disparities in adult asthma.

"Genetics of Asthma In Latino Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma prevalence, morbidity and mortality are higher among Latino Americans on the east coast than on the west coast of the U.S. This is in stark contrast to the near geographic uniformity of asthma morbidity and mortality rates among African Americans and Caucasians in the U.S. The differences in asthma prevalence and severity among Latino Americans on the two coasts may reflect differences in the genetic contributions of Ancestral Native American, Spanish and African populations to the Latino population on the east coast (predominantly Puerto Rican) and west coast (predominantly Mexican). To determine whether identifiable genetic factors are associated with asthma and severe asthma among Mexican Americans, the largest U.S. Hispanic group, we will recruit Mexican American asthmatic subjects (probands) and their biologic parents (n=600) from California during a 1 year period. Probands will undergo formal phenotypic characterization. We will assemble a repository of DNA and plasma from the probands and their parents. We will identify novel single nucleotide plymorphisms (SNPs) among candidate genes at loci where there is evidence to suggest linkage to asthma in previous studies of other populations. We will determine whether novel SNPs and SNPs known to be associated with asthma in other populations are associated with asthma in Mexican Americans. We will compare the results generated from this repository to similar ongoing studies in Puerto Rican asthmatic families. The creation of a repository of DNA from well-characterized Mexican American asthmatics will enable future analysis of other genes identified in other studies. The results of this work may have important implications for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of asthma not only in Mexican Americans, but in other populations as well. The proposed research project is one component of a career development plan designed to prepare the applicant to lead an independent program applying novel advances in genomics to improving the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in medically underserved populations. The training component of this application includes oversight from an experienced pulmonary physician-scientist (Dr. Dean Sheppard), with a strong track-record in training successful pulmonary academicians, formal mentoring from a multidisciplinary scientific advisory committee, all collaborators from GALA, and advanced didactic training in clinical research design and genetic association studies. This proposal?s focus is consistent with the goal established by Healthy People 2010, to reduce disparities in health among different populations.

"Adult Asthma: Biology, Society and Environment   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental, biological, and                  psychosocial factors can all separately influence the disease burden in asthma.      As yet, no studies have taken into account all three categories of factors           together, to examine their relative contributions to the disease burden and          investigate whether their cumulative effects can explain the health disparities      of at-risk populations, either additively or synergistically. Asthma is an           ideal chronic condition in which to delineate the potential linkages among           biological mechanisms, social factors, and physical environments and, more           specifically, to show how these linkages may lead to health disparities. Study       Hypotheses: 1) There are socioeconomic status (SES) differentials in the             disease burden of asthma; 2) Environmental, biological, and psychosocial             factors are linked to the asthma disease burden additively, if not                   synergistically; and 3) The variance in SES differentials of disease burden          will be substantially explained by modeling that takes specific environmental,       biological, and psychosocial factors into account. Methods: This proposed study      will make use of an established panel of 590 adults with asthma of varying           severity. We propose to supplement these survey data with 500 home site visits       in which we will directly gather environmental, biological, and psychosocial         data. Specific environmental risk factors we will quantify include: allergen         sensitization, home allergens, ETS exposure, and indoor air quality. We will         also assess perceived stress and social support. In addition, we will link           subjects to other potential exposures through external data sets. We will also       administer a follow-up survey to investigate the combined influence of               environmental, biological, and psychosocial exposures in explaining SES              disparities in the disease burden of asthma. This study combines a                   multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in clinical medicine,           social sciences, epidemiology, psychology, endocrinology, asthma treatment and       prevention, and biostatistics. Anticipated Results and Significance: The             proposed investigation will have sufficient power to detect differences in the       proportions of outcomes between two groups in the range of 10-15 percent at the      0.05 level for dichotomous outcomes.

"PEDIATRIC ASTHMA DISPARITIES: PERCEPTIONS AND MANAGEMENT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Pediatric asthma, the most common chronic illness of childhood, is increasing in prevalence, morbidity and mortality : particularly in minority children.  This application seeks to establish the Rhode Island : Puerto Rico Asthma Center (RIPRAC) for reducing disparities in asthma among Latino children.  Brown University faculty involved with an extensive pediatric asthma research program will join with epidemiologists, clinicians, and health services researchers from the minority serving University of Puerto Rico to study potentially overlooked determinants of disparity.  An ambitious training component (based on a successful T32 research training program) will involve individuals from both sites at both sites.  The RIPRAC Research AIMS include four projects that seek to understand the causes of disparities at multiple levels : the biomedical, the individual/family, and the socioenvironmental level.  The four projects, respectively, will 1) examine discrepancies between the diagnosis of asthma as assessed by parental report, the primary care medical record and our systematic diagnosis base on the NHLBI guidelines; 2) assess characteristics (prescription practices, shared decision making, continuity and access to care) of the health care system that may differentially affect asthma morbidity; 3) evaluate family beliefs, the burden of asthma management and medication adherence as they affect asthma morbidity and health care utilization in Latino and Anglo children; and 4) study the relation of symptom perception to pediatric asthma discrepancies.  Subjects for all 4 projects will be the same 300 mainland Anglos, 200 mainland Latinos (of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent) and 400 island Puerto Rico children with asthma, aged 7-15, thereby promoting comparability and efficiency.  Chi-square analyses and ANOVA's will be used to assess differences between groups; techniques of logistic regression and multiple regression will be used to model the effects of covariates.  The RIPRAC Training component will provide clinical research education and supervision to Puerto Rican trainees and faculty, enhance cultural awareness of Brown personnel as it relates to asthma disparities, and launch at least three trainee-led pilot research projects in the area.

"Genetics of Asthma In Latino Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma prevalence, morbidity and mortality are higher among Latino Americans on the east coast than on the west coast of the U.S. This is in stark contrast to the near geographic uniformity of asthma morbidity and mortality rates among African Americans and Caucasians in the U.S. The differences in asthma prevalence and severity among Latino Americans on the two coasts may reflect differences in the genetic contributions of Ancestral Native American, Spanish and African populations to the Latino population on the east coast (predominantly Puerto Rican) and west coast (predominantly Mexican). To determine whether identifiable genetic factors are associated with asthma and severe asthma among Mexican Americans, the largest U.S. Hispanic group, we will recruit Mexican American asthmatic subjects (probands) and their biologic parents (n=600) from California during a 1 year period. Probands will undergo formal phenotypic characterization. We will assemble a repository of DNA and plasma from the probands and their parents. We will identify novel single nucleotide plymorphisms (SNPs) among candidate genes at loci where there is evidence to suggest linkage to asthma in previous studies of other populations. We will determine whether novel SNPs and SNPs known to be associated with asthma in other populations are associated with asthma in Mexican Americans. We will compare the results generated from this repository to similar ongoing studies in Puerto Rican asthmatic families. The creation of a repository of DNA from well-characterized Mexican American asthmatics will enable future analysis of other genes identified in other studies. The results of this work may have important implications for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of asthma not only in Mexican Americans, but in other populations as well. The proposed research project is one component of a career development plan designed to prepare the applicant to lead an independent program applying novel advances in genomics to improving the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in medically underserved populations. The training component of this application includes oversight from an experienced pulmonary physician-scientist (Dr. Dean Sheppard), with a strong track-record in training successful pulmonary academicians, formal mentoring from a multidisciplinary scientific advisory committee, all collaborators from GALA, and advanced didactic training in clinical research design and genetic association studies.

"Determinants of asthma severity in Harlem (DASH) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent rise in asthma morbidity and mortality has impacted the African American population disproportionately. It is likely that in addition to environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility factors have contributed to this disparity. Little is known, however, about how specific genetic polymorphisms, including those on chromosome 5q, impact the pathogenesis of asthma. Though the prevalence of specific polymorphisms (allelic variants) is known to vary across populations (population stratification), genetic studies on asthma in African Americans have characteristically included small numbers, and inadequate controls. Moreover, there is almost no information about the immunological pathways that contribute to asthma severity in this population. Our study, DASH (Determinants of Asthma Severity in Harlem), seeks to establish the link between specific genotypic variants and phenotypic markers, and to elucidate immunological pathways that contribute to asthma severity in an African American population. DASH addresses the next step in reaching our long-range goal, i.e., to control asthma in the African American population of Harlem. We propose a case-control study of individuals of African American heritage, who live in Central and West Harlem. We will test our central hypothesis: Polymorphisms in candidate asthma genes on chromosome 5g modify disease severity in individuals who have asthma, and these polymorphisms and specific T cell response phenotypes differ between individuals who have asthma and those who do not. The research plan will address the following specific aims: (1) to define the phenotype and allelic variants of the IL-4, IL-13 and Beta2-adrenoreceptor genes among African American asthmatic individuals (cases) and controls; and (2) to define T cell response phenotypes among African Americans who have asthma. The DASH study represents the largest effort undertaken to date, to study the genetics of asthma in an African American population; and it seeks to elucidate important immunological mechanisms (T-cell responses) that contribute to asthma severity. Moreover, it enables the linkage of T-cell responses to specific allelic variants. Our approach is to apply modern technologies (haplotype analysis; immunophenotyping) toward development of a mechanism-based framework for understanding pathways that underlie asthma severity in the African American population. The data collected through the DASH study will elucidate the relevance of emerging directions for asthma management, including pharmacogenetic strategies, for this population. The potential public health benefits are critical for the asthmatic population in general.

"Preventive Asthma Care Utilization among Black Children Epidemiological data suggests increased morbidity, prevalence and mortality associated with asthma among African-American children. This population tends to over-utilize the emergency department for asthma care although preventive asthma care within the primary care setting is more optimal to control and manage asthma-associated morbidity. Previous studies have suggested that racial differences in the rates of preventive asthma care utilization can be attributed to several factors, including the disparity in health insurance coverage between racial groups, social, financial and system barriers to preventive asthma care, and divergent health care seeking beliefs among African-American women. For my dissertation research, I plan to investigate how ""race"" when defined explicitly as social class, culturally derived health beliefs, and exposure to structural forces such as racism mediates my outcome of interest, utilization of preventive asthma care.

"Asthma Disparities in Cohorts at Risk for Morbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The goals of this Center are to determine the mechanisms underlying the disparities in asthma, and to improve asthma care in a targeted group at high risk for asthma-specific, maternal and perinatal complications, pregnant women with asthma. The proposed Meharry-Vanderbilt Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities entitled Asthma Disparities in Cohorts at Risk for Morbidity@ is a joint collaborative effort produced in the context of a formal alliance between the institutions, the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance. This Alliance commits the two institutions to learn from each other for the benefit of student education, patient care, and research progress. The Alliance has already established NIH funding, organized community outreach, and formalized institutional cross training. The proposed Center would be a natural extension of Alliance goals and methods. The training projects were developed jointly to optimize the unique values of the minority serving institution, Meharry Medical College, and the research intensive institution, Vanderbilt University. Funds are dedicated for summer research experiences for medical students and for pilot investigations relevant to asthma disparities. This proposal targets minority groups at risk of significant asthma-related morbidity: pregnant women, children requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and asthmatics requiring emergency care. A controlled randomized trial of the relative efficacy of two culturally sensitive asthma education and smoking cessation programs will target pregnant women with asthma of black or Hispanic race/ethnicity. Simultaneously, the same investigators will examine asthma-related morbidity in a large cohort of pregnant women utilizing administrative data and vital records. Perceptions of asthma severity and ways to describe it appear to differ in Blacks compared to whites. Therefore we will convene focus groups of patients and families attending the emergency room to validate a culturally sensitive instrument to allow improved descriptors of asthma severity for Blacks. Estimates by the patients of asthma severity will be matched to objective measures, and compared with those of whites. This methodology will then be used to extend the hypothesis to children admitted with severe asthma to the region=s only pediatric ICU. In the pediatric ICU, the admission rates and outcomes will be associated with the potentially important genetic variations in the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (BADR2). Using parents and non-affected siblings as case controls, a novel computational method will test for gene-gene interactions that explain a genetic basis for asthma disparities in severe asthma. These interrelated projects jointly conducted by investigators from each institution will illuminate the mechanisms responsible for asthma disparities and provide novel interventions in targeted minority groups at risk for morbidity from asthma.

"Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma and marked improvements in the therapies available to treat asthma, disadvantaged and minority communities still carry a disproportionate burden from asthma. The exact reasons for this phenomenon are unknown, however, a number of factors have been proposed to account for this disparity, including genetic differences in vulnerability to asthma or asthma severity, differential rates of environmental exposure (e.g. cockroaches, dust), differences in the accessibility and quality of asthma medical care for patients of differing socioeconomic status, and inadequate asthma self-management practices, including poor adherence with therapy. It is widely believed that these factors interact to cause the observed excess burden of asthma within low-income, minority populations. Howard University and Johns Hopkins University have a long and successful history of collaborative studies designed to evaluate asthma morbidity in low-income, African-American children and adults with asthma. This application draws on this rich history to propose the formal collaboration of these institutions and investigators as a part of the Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities. Specifically, this application presents four research projects designed to collaboratively investigate factors associated with the disproportionate burden of asthma experienced by inner-city, African-American children and adults. This application includes studies that will evaluate both the underlying genetic factors that may contribute to the observed excess risk in African-American communities, as well as studies of provider-patient communication designed to assess intervention strategies for remediating this risk. In addition, an essential goal of the Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities will be to create a culturally sensitive training environment that is truly reciprocal, and designed to both enrich and enhance the research potential and asthma management capabilities of both participating institutions.

"LIFE STRESS AND BIOMARKERS AS RELATED TO ASTHMA RISK This project will provide cross-discipline training for the Principal Investigator (PI), cultivating skills and expertise in the epidemiological study of both individual-and community-level life stessors, focusing in particular on how these stressors impact childhood asthma risk.  The PI is trained in pulmonary medicine and has completed a fellowship in respiratory epidemiology at the Channing Laboratory, earning an MPH from the Harvard School of Public Health.  Further training and research will be carried out under the supervision of a multidisciplinary, highly qualified advisory committee of sponsors and co- investigators with expertise in asthma epidemiology, life stress research, developmental and neuropsychological outcomes, immunology, and community-level stress research (i.e., violence epidemiology).  Career development will be enhanced through cross-discipline course work and participation in seminars and national meetings related to stress and respiratory research. This award, along with the PI's clinical and scientific background, will facilitate the development of a successful independent research career with a focus on environmental stress and asthma outcomes.  Etiologies of the rising prevalence and morbidity of asthma, and of the disproportionate burden among urban children, are not well understood.  Differential exposure to life stress may in part explain disparities in disease burden. The role of stress in the expression of asthma is largely unexplored in epidemiological studies.  The overall scientific goal of the proposed studies is to examine the associations between multi-level measures of life stress (i.e., negative life events, perceived stress, neighborhood disadvantage, violence exposure) and asthma outcomes in representative samples of urban children followed prospectively.  We hypothesize that children exposed to high-level stress will be at greater risk for asthma development than children with low-level stress exposure. Furthermore, we hypothesize that high-stress environments will predict greater asthma morbidity (i.e., emergency room visits, hospitalizations).  The influence of stress on T-helper cell differentiation as reflected in cytokine profiles and IgE production (TH2 phenotype) will also be examined.  Additionally, sequelae of environmental stress, such as neuropsychological and behavioral impairments, that may affect health promotion behaviors (i.e., compliance) and result in greater asthma morbidity, will be assessed.  The PI will gain expertise in the epidemiological approach to stress as it relates to asthma risk and will establish a network of long-term collaborative relationships that will enhance the ability to become an established independent investigator.

"Chicago Initiative to Raise Asthma Health Equity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Over the past decade there has been a heightened awareness of the disproportionate impact of asthma morbidity and mortality among African Americans and persons of lower social economic status.  The causes underlying this disparity have not been fully elucidated.  However, there is strong evidence that the levels of social stress imposed by this condition and the degree of coping and self-management skills present are factors that may be particularly important in explaining these disparities.  The purpose of this project is to develop a collaborative research program between Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Cook County Hospital to fully characterize the relationship of social stress, coping, and self-regulatory health behaviors in the context of asthma disparities among African American and low income populations.  Once characterized, the project will then develop and test an intervention strategy to reduce asthma disparities in high-risk populations based on evidence-based models that have demonstrated success in social work, nursing, and community interventions.  There are four research aims for this proposed Center of Excellence.  (1) To develop and validate culturally appropriate psychosocial instruments related to the underlying causes of disparity in asthma morbidity (2) To identify the structural relationships of psychosocial factors to other known influential factors related to disparities in asthma outcomes.  (3) To study the changes in structural relationship among influential factors in asthma disparity over time as related to changes in health status.  (4) To develop, pilot test, and field test a community-based asthma team (peer coach, asthma nurse, and social worker) intervention to enhance individuals ability to cope with chronic illness and improve asthma-related behaviors.

In the pediatric ICU, the admission rates and outcomes will be associated with the potentially important genetic variations in the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (BADR2). Using parents and non-affected siblings as case controls, a novel computational method will test for gene-gene interactions that explain a genetic basis for asthma disparities in severe asthma. These interrelated projects jointly conducted by investigators from each institution will illuminate the mechanisms responsible for asthma disparities and provide novel interventions in targeted minority groups at risk for morbidity from asthma.

"Chicago Initiative to Raise Asthma Health Equity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Over the past decade there has been a heightened awareness of the disproportionate impact of asthma morbidity and mortality among African Americans and persons of lower social economic status. The causes underlying this disparity have not been fully elucidated. However, there is strong evidence that the level of social stress imposed by this condition and the degree of coping and self-management skills present are factors that may be particularly important in explaining these disparities. The purpose of this project is to develop a collaborative research program between Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Cook County Hospital to fully characterize the relationship of social stress, coping, and self-regulatory health behaviors in the context of asthma disparities among African American and low income populations. Once characterized, the project will then develop and test an intervention strategy to reduce asthma disparities in high-risk populations based on evidence-based models that have demonstrated success in social work, nursing, and community interventions. There are four research aims for this proposed Center of Excellence.      (1) To develop and validate culturally appropriate psychosocial instruments related to the underlying causes of disparity in asthma morbidity (2) To identify the structural relationships of psychosocial factors to other known influential factors related to disparities in asthma outcomes. (3) To study the changes in structural relationship among influential factors in asthma disparity over time as related to changes in health status. (4) To develop, pilot test, and field test a community-based asthma team (peer coach, asthma nurse, and social worker) intervention to enhance individuals ability to cope with chronic illness and improve asthma-related behaviors. A second major goal of this Center will be to train and mentor new clinical investigators and social scientists to be able to conduct research in this field of interest.

"SOCIAL FACTORS & THE ENVIRONMENT IN PEDIATRIC ASTHMA   DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigators' Abstract)                                                                                                                      Asthma is an increasingly common, complex condition with rising morbidity and        mortality.  Racial disparities in pediatric asthma prevalence and severity           indicate higher rates among indigent, non-Caucasians living in urban                 communities.  The greatest proportional increase in deaths due to asthma has         occurred in the 10-14 year-old age range.  This proposal studies the racial          disparities in pediatric asthma outcome among low income African American,           Latino, and Caucasian elementary school-aged children.  The goal is to clarify       the biologic and environmental, as well as the social and behavioral,                processes that lead to these disparities.                                                                                                                                 Asthma screening will be done at three sets of six elementary schools as a           service to the schools.  Parents returning the screen will serve as the              population from which three cohorts of elementary school-aged children will be       recruited, one in each of the first three years of the project.  The screen          yields three groups of children in each cohort:  one group that has previously       diagnosed asthma, a second group that has possible, undiagnosed asthma               (positive screens), and a third group that has no evidence of asthma symptoms        (negative screen).  The children screening positive will be followed every six       months for 12 months to obtain three additional points of data.  A random            sample from those who screen negative for asthma will be recruited as a              comparison group for the first data point only.                                                                                                                           Information gathered at the three time points include 1) information on              childhood asthma control (health services utilization and symptoms) and              general physical health, and 2) caregiver life stressors, physical health, and       depression.  Time points 1 and 3 (T1 and T3) are telephone interviews.  Also         at T1, children who screened positive for asthma will have allergy testing at        school for common respiratory allergies.  The interview at time point 2 (T2)         is conducted during a home visit, at which time a home environmental screen is       conducted and two dust samples collected and later analyzed for dust mite,           cockroach, and cat antigens.  Also at T3 (one year after the screening results                                                   are returned), parents will be interviewed about how they made the decision          whether or not to seek care, from whom, and with what success.  Selected             healthcare providers will be sent a questionnaire regarding the children's           care.  All stages of the project include a Community Outreach and Education          Plan, culminating in community meetings in the final year to share results and       consider next steps.

"Communication, Perspectives, & Child Asthma Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care is a national priority.  Minority children bear a disproportionate share of the burden of asthma, a leading cause of childhood morbidity.  Recent studies have found that African-American and Latino children are less likely to be using needed preventive asthma medications than White children are, even when health insurance is equalized.  Culturally tailored interventions hold promise to close such gaps.  However, scant information is available to suggest how such interventions should be designed.   Specific Aims and Research Plan.  This innovative project will pair qualitative and quantitative methods to study African-American, Latino, and White children with persistent asthma.  We will: 1.  Identify elements of effective communication in clinical interactions; 2.  Determine other key factors leading to under-use of preventive medications; and 3.  Lay the foundation for developing tools to enhance effective clinical decision-making that incorporates parent and child perspectives.  In the Qualitative Phase, we will audiotape clinical interactions and conduct semi-structured interviews with parents and providers.  The qualitative results will suggest specific possible interventions to reduce disparities.  In the subsequent Survey Phase, we will test the generalizability of hypotheses from the qualitative research.  We will conduct a retrospective cohort study in two large, diverse populations, linking data from telephone interviews with parents, surveys of providers, and computerized data on asthma medications and other health care use.  The unique strengths of this research include our ability to study the parent-child-provider interaction using different and complementary data sources, our access to computerized data, and our plan to identify areas of similarity and contrast among different racial/ethnic groups using both qualitative and quantitative methods.    Projected Findings and Policy Implications: Our results will identify specific elements of effective communication and decision making for African-American, Latino, and White families.  This information is critical to the design of effective, culturally tailored interventions to eliminate disparities in health care for childhood asthma and other chronic diseases.         ","Communication, Perspectives, & Child Asthma Disparities",6602372,R01HD044070,"['child (0-11) ', ' health education ', ' human subject ', ' asthma ', ' informatics ', ' epidemiology ', ' health survey ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' chemoprevention ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' communication ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2003,385464,0.20938232709136415

"Determinants of Asthma Morbidity in an Urban Population DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Despite advances in asthma therapy, asthma morbidity has increased dramatically in the past decade, especially among inner-city minority populations. While epidemiological studies have highlighted the sociodemographic groups most at risk for illness and death, the underlying reasons for these disparities in health are not well understood. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the factors contributing to asthma morbidity in inner-city minority populations. The specific aims are to: (1) develop an instrument to measure patient adherence to asthma control medications; (2) determine the relative contribution of low adherence to medications, inadequate patient-provider communication, and poor access to care to poor asthma outcomes; (3) test if sensitization and indoor exposure to cockroach allergen result in increased asthma morbidity; and (4) develop the protocol and perform pilot testing of an intervention to improve the outcomes of adult inner-city asthmatics.      The proposed study will enroll 420 adults with persistent asthma from the Primary Care Clinic of the Mount Sinai Hospital, located in East Harlem, a community in the epicenter of the asthma epidemic. The protocol will include a comprehensive baseline interview followed by telephone questionnaires at 4- and 12-weeks. The domains covered by the baseline interview will include sociodemographics, co-morbidities, access to care, past utilization, current medications, adherence, knowledge, beliefs, psychological symptoms, quality of patient-provider communication, environmental exposure to indoor allergens, and metered dose inhaler technique. Allergen specific IgE antibodies will be used to document allergic sensitization. At 4 and 12 weeks following the baseline assessment, telephone interviews will be conducted to obtain data on asthma symptoms, quality of life, peak flow   measurements, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and unscheduled outpatient visits.   In the final 11/2 years of the project, the data collected from the initial phase of this proposal will be used to develop and pilot a self-management intervention to improve the outcome of inner-city asthmatics.   During the five-year project, the candidate will pursue advanced graduate work in clinical epidemiology and health services research to further develop his scientific skills.

"Social Support and Education in Asthma Follow-Up    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our previous NHLBI-supported study (HL 57232) showed that a combination treatment of ""Coaching"" through follow-up phone calls 2 and 5 days following an index ED visit plus monetary incentive was highly effective in increasing the percentage of low-income urban children who received recommended primary care within 2 weeks of the ED visit for asthma, 44% in the intervention group vs 29% in usual care (p = 0.0004). However, the intervention was not associated with significant differences in morbidity (subsequent ED visits). We conclude that the intervention was effective in promoting the initial link to primary care, but was not effective in sustaining that link or management practices to minimize acuity of symptoms during exacerbation. Here we propose an expansion of the intervention initiated at the time of an ED visit for asthma to promote ongoing primary care and effective asthma management. Parents of low-income, urban, predominantly African American children, aged 2 - 12 years will be recruited at the time of their children's ED visits for acute wheezing. The experimental Intervention is designed to reduce morbidity from recurrent asthma through ongoing education and social support to encourage long-term primary care and adherence to recommended asthma management practices. It will include: 1) as in our previous study, monetary incentive to visit the PCP in order to start the process of ongoing care; 2) as in our previous study, contact by an asthma ""Coach,"" but now extended through 12 months following the ED visit and focusing not only on attending primary care as recommended but also on parent adherence to asthma management strategies developed with the primary care provider (PCP); and 3) telemedicine provided by asthma nurses to reinforce asthma management strategies and assess the status of the child's asthma continued through 6 months following the index ED visit. After informed consent, cases will be randomly assigned to either Usual Care or Intervention, stratified by PCP clinic. All children will receive standardized/usual ED care to resolve wheezing and standardized discharge advice. Follow-up to assess study outcomes will be scheduled every 6 months from the time of randomization of each case and continue for 24 months following randomization. Intended impacts on patterns of care will be assessed by proportions of children who have a visit to their PCP for asthma planning within 2 weeks after the index ED visit and [3]1 subsequent PCP visit for regular care that includes asthma planning during the 24 months of follow-up. Primary outcome will be asthma morbidity, as indexed by the proportion of children who have at least one ED visit during the 24-month follow-up period. Additional outcomes will include the proportion of children who have at least 1 hospitalization, the proportion of participants with [3]1 visit to the PCP for acute asthma, and the net cost of asthma-related care, all through the 24 months of intervention and follow-up. Planned enrolment is 248 subjects (124 per group) to provide 80% power at p = .05 to detect a reduction of ED visits of 20%. Because the primary outcome can be obtained from medical records after consent even if phone contact cannot be maintained, intent to treat model will be used for analyses.

"HOWARD/HOPKINS CENTER FOR REDUCING ASTHMA DISPARTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma and marked   improvements in the therapies available to treat asthma, disadvantaged and minority communities still carry a disproportionate burden from asthma. The exact reasons for this phenomenon are unknown, however, a number of factors have been proposed to account for this disparity, including genetic differences in vulnerability to asthma or asthma severity, differential rates of environmental exposure (e.g. cockroaches, dust), differences in the accessibility and quality of asthma medical care for patients of differing socioeconomic status, and inadequate asthma self-management practices, including poor adherence with therapy. It is widely believed that these factors interact to cause the observed excess burden of asthma within low-income, minority populations. Howard University and Johns Hopkins University have a long and successful history of collaborative studies designed to evaluate asthma morbidity in low-income, African-American children and adults with asthma. This application draws on this rich history to propose the formal collaboration of these institutions and investigators as a part of the Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities. Specifically, this application presents four research projects designed to collaboratively investigate factors associated with the disproportionate burden of asthma experienced by inner-city, African-American children and adults. This application includes studies that will evaluate both the underlying genetic factors that may contribute to the observed excess risk in African-American communities, as well as studies of provider-patient communication designed to assess intervention strategies for remediating this risk. In addition, an essential goal of the Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities will be to create a culturally sensitive training environment that is truly reciprocal, and designed to both enrich and enhance the research potential and asthma management capabilities of both participating institutions.

"LIFE STRESS AND BIOMARKERS AS RELATED TO ASTHMA RISK This project will provide cross-discipline training for the Principal Investigator (PI), cultivating skills and expertise in the epidemiological study of both individual-and community-level life stessors, focusing in particular on how these stressors impact childhood asthma risk.  The PI is trained in pulmonary medicine and has completed a fellowship in respiratory epidemiology at the Channing Laboratory, earning an MPH from the Harvard School of Public Health.  Further training and research will be carried out under the supervision of a multidisciplinary, highly qualified advisory committee of sponsors and co- investigators with expertise in asthma epidemiology, life stress research, developmental and neuropsychological outcomes, immunology, and community-level stress research (i.e., violence epidemiology).  Career development will be enhanced through cross-discipline course work and participation in seminars and national meetings related to stress and respiratory research. This award, along with the PI's clinical and scientific background, will facilitate the development of a successful independent research career with a focus on environmental stress and asthma outcomes.  Etiologies of the rising prevalence and morbidity of asthma, and of the disproportionate burden among urban children, are not well understood.  Differential exposure to life stress may in part explain disparities in disease burden. The role of stress in the expression of asthma is largely unexplored in epidemiological studies.  The overall scientific goal of the proposed studies is to examine the associations between multi-level measures of life stress (i.e., negative life events, perceived stress, neighborhood disadvantage, violence exposure) and asthma outcomes in representative samples of urban children followed prospectively.  We hypothesize that children exposed to high-level stress will be at greater risk for asthma development than children with low-level stress exposure. Furthermore, we hypothesize that high-stress environments will predict greater asthma morbidity (i.e., emergency room visits, hospitalizations).  The influence of stress on T-helper cell differentiation as reflected in cytokine profiles and IgE production (TH2 phenotype) will also be examined.  Additionally, sequelae of environmental stress, such as neuropsychological and behavioral impairments, that may affect health promotion behaviors (i.e., compliance) and result in greater asthma morbidity, will be assessed.  The PI will gain expertise in the epidemiological approach to stress as it relates to asthma risk and will establish a network of long-term collaborative relationships that will enhance the ability to become an established independent investigator.

"Communities Organized Against Asthma and Lead (COAL) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Communities Organized Against Asthma and Lead: Project COAL (Communidades organizadas contra asthma y plomo) will be a partnership between De Madres a Madres, Inc. in Houston, TX, The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Casa de Amigos Health Center, and the Environmental Justice Clinic at Texas Southern University School of Law.  The partnership will bring together a well-established and respected community based organization in the Near North Side community of Houston, with Environmental Toxicologists in the NIEHS Center at UTMB, health care providers at the Harris County Hospital District Clinic serving the Near North Side, and attorneys and law students with a history of response to environmental health problems in disadvantaged communities.  This partnership will address two pressing environmental problems in the homes of this community: exposure of children to lead, from paint, and to agents that can trigger asthma.  We will address these issues first through a novel approach to communication using theater as a means to educate and to elicit responses from the community.  This approach will inform the community about Project COAL and provide local knowledge from the community to the partners in this project.  The second focus of the project will be to serve the needs of residents in the community by making assessments of their homes to identify sources of lead and agents that can trigger asthma.  Paint samples will be tested for lead.  Levels of allergens (dust mites, mold spores, pollen) in the air will be determined, irritant chemicals and allergens from insects and rodents will be measured.  UTMB will train local resident home assessment teams and perform the laboratory tests.  Residents will be given training to enable them to reduce or eliminate these hazards from their homes and they will receive consistent follow-up from the home assessment teams.  The medical clinic and environmental justice clinic will serve in an advisory capacity and provide data about the community, and assist in specific situations when the need arises.

"Determinants of asthma severity in Harlem (DASH) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent rise in asthma morbidity and mortality has impacted the African American population disproportionately. It is likely that in addition to environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility factors have contributed to this disparity. Little is known, however, about how specific genetic polymorphisms, including those on chromosome 5q, impact the pathogenesis of asthma. Though the prevalence of specific polymorphisms (allelic variants) is known to vary across populations (population stratification), genetic studies on asthma in African Americans have characteristically included small numbers, and inadequate controls. Moreover, there is almost no information about the immunological pathways that contribute to asthma severity in this population. Our study, DASH (Determinants of Asthma Severity in Harlem), seeks to establish the link between specific genotypic variants and phenotypic markers, and to elucidate immunological pathways that contribute to asthma severity in an African American population. DASH addresses the next step in reaching our long-range goal, i.e., to control asthma in the African American population of Harlem. We propose a case-control study of individuals of African American heritage, who live in Central and West Harlem. We will test our central hypothesis: Polymorphisms in candidate asthma genes on chromosome 5g modify disease severity in individuals who have asthma, and these polymorphisms and specific T cell response phenotypes differ between individuals who have asthma and those who do not. The research plan will address the following specific aims: (1) to define the phenotype and allelic variants of the IL-4, IL-13 and Beta2-adrenoreceptor genes among African American asthmatic individuals (cases) and controls; and (2) to define T cell response phenotypes among African Americans who have asthma. The DASH study represents the largest effort undertaken to date, to study the genetics of asthma in an African American population; and it seeks to elucidate important immunological mechanisms (T-cell responses) that contribute to asthma severity. Moreover, it enables the linkage of T-cell responses to specific allelic variants. Our approach is to apply modern technologies (haplotype analysis; immunophenotyping) toward development of a mechanism-based framework for understanding pathways that underlie asthma severity in the African American population. The data collected through the DASH study will elucidate the relevance of emerging directions for asthma management, including pharmacogenetic strategies, for this population. The potential public health benefits are critical for the asthmatic population in general.

"Asthma Disparities in Cohorts at Risk for Morbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The goals of this Center are to determine the mechanisms underlying the disparities in asthma, and to improve asthma care in a targeted group at high risk for asthma-specific, maternal and perinatal complications, pregnant women with asthma. The proposed Meharry-Vanderbilt Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities entitled Asthma Disparities in Cohorts at Risk for Morbidity@ is a joint collaborative effort produced in the context of a formal alliance between the institutions, the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance. This Alliance commits the two institutions to learn from each other for the benefit of student education, patient care, and research progress. The Alliance has already established NIH funding, organized community outreach, and formalized institutional cross training. The proposed Center would be a natural extension of Alliance goals and methods. The training projects were developed jointly to optimize the unique values of the minority serving institution, Meharry Medical College, and the research intensive institution, Vanderbilt University. Funds are dedicated for summer research experiences for medical students and for pilot investigations relevant to asthma disparities. This proposal targets minority groups at risk of significant asthma-related morbidity: pregnant women, children requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and asthmatics requiring emergency care. A controlled randomized trial of the relative efficacy of two culturally sensitive asthma education and smoking cessation programs will target pregnant women with asthma of black or Hispanic race/ethnicity. Simultaneously, the same investigators will examine asthma-related morbidity in a large cohort of pregnant women utilizing administrative data and vital records. Perceptions of asthma severity and ways to describe it appear to differ in Blacks compared to whites. Therefore we will convene focus groups of patients and families attending the emergency room to validate a culturally sensitive instrument to allow improved descriptors of asthma severity for Blacks. Estimates by the patients of asthma severity will be matched to objective measures, and compared with those of whites. This methodology will then be used to extend the hypothesis to children admitted with severe asthma to the region=s only pediatric ICU. In the pediatric ICU, the admission rates and outcomes will be associated with the potentially important genetic variations in the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (BADR2). Using parents and non-affected siblings as case controls, a novel computational method will test for gene-gene interactions that explain a genetic basis for asthma disparities in severe asthma. These interrelated projects jointly conducted by investigators from each institution will illuminate the mechanisms responsible for asthma disparities and provide novel interventions in targeted minority groups at risk for morbidity from asthma.

"Chicago Initiative to Raise Asthma Health Equity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Over the past decade there has been a heightened awareness of the disproportionate impact of asthma morbidity and mortality among African Americans and persons of lower social economic status.  The causes underlying this disparity have not been fully elucidated.  However, there is strong evidence that the levels of social stress imposed by this condition and the degree of coping and self-management skills present are factors that may be particularly important in explaining these disparities.  The purpose of this project is to develop a collaborative research program between Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Cook County Hospital to fully characterize the relationship of social stress, coping, and self-regulatory health behaviors in the context of asthma disparities among African American and low income populations.  Once characterized, the project will then develop and test an intervention strategy to reduce asthma disparities in high-risk populations based on evidence-based models that have demonstrated success in social work, nursing, and community interventions.  There are four research aims for this proposed Center of Excellence.  (1) To develop and validate culturally appropriate psychosocial instruments related to the underlying causes of disparity in asthma morbidity (2) To identify the structural relationships of psychosocial factors to other known influential factors related to disparities in asthma outcomes.  (3) To study the changes in structural relationship among influential factors in asthma disparity over time as related to changes in health status.  (4) To develop, pilot test, and field test a community-based asthma team (peer coach, asthma nurse, and social worker) intervention to enhance individuals ability to cope with chronic illness and improve asthma-related behaviors.

"Preventive Asthma Care Utilization among Black Children Epidemiological data suggests increased morbidity, prevalence and mortality associated with asthma among African-American children. This population tends to over-utilize the emergency department for asthma care although preventive asthma care within the primary care setting is more optimal to control and manage asthma-associated morbidity. Previous studies have suggested that racial differences in the rates of preventive asthma care utilization can be attributed to several factors, including the disparity in health insurance coverage between racial groups, social, financial and system barriers to preventive asthma care, and divergent health care seeking beliefs among African-American women. For my dissertation research, I plan to investigate how ""race"" when defined explicitly as social class, culturally derived health beliefs, and exposure to structural forces such as racism mediates my outcome of interest, utilization of preventive asthma care.

"EFFICACY OF WRITTEN TREATMENT PLANS IN ASTHMA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective self-management of asthma requires that patients or their caregivers recognize the early symptoms of an exacerbation and initiate appropriate interventions aimed at preventing the progression of symptoms. Most asthma clinical guidelines suggest that the incorporation of a written self-management plan is an essential tool that patients must possess, be able to understand, and follow if they are to respond appropriately to changes in asthma status. Nevertheless, there are no controlled trials examining the efficacy of the written plan itself. Furthermore, even if written plans are an essential and an effective component of successful self-management, the data suggest that few patients receive them. Barriers to the use of written plans need more study if patients and physicians are to increase their use of this tool. Additionally, studies are needed to examine the efficacy of written plans across different patient populations. The overall goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of a model, written treatment plan in a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) compared with the usual care that is provided by a group of adult and pediatric pulmonologists and allergists in their practice settings. The model plan is a form that allows a treatment regimen consistent with NHLBI guidelines to be conveyed to patients. An additional goal is to assess how patients from different racial/ethnic backgrounds utilize treatments plans. Specific aims: 1) to identify barriers to the use of written plans and determine whether these barriers differ across racial/ethnic groups; 2) to develop, validate, and pilot test a model written treatment plan form plus instructions to doctors for its use; and 3) to conduct a RCT of the model plan form with African-American, Latino, and non-Latino white patients to: a) assess the efficacy of the plan across patient populations and b) determine if using written plans reduce racial/ethnic disparities in asthma outcomes. We hypothesize that patients with asthma who receive the model written plan form will have, relative to patients in the control group, significantly greater improvement in 3 primary outcome measures: 1.1) reduction in asthma symptom frequency; 1.2) reduction in emergency use of health care services; and 1.3) improved quality of life. We will also examine 4 secondary outcome measures: 1.4) asthma hospitalizations; 1.5) days with activity restriction; 1.6) the proportion of patients in the intervention group who receive the plan during the initial visit; and 1.7) use of the plans by patients.         ",EFFICACY OF WRITTEN TREATMENT PLANS IN ASTHMA,6671785,R01HL073955,"['patient care management ', ' patient care planning ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care personnel performance ', ' human subject ', ' asthma ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,537011,0.31828880405636656

"PEDIATRIC ASTHMA DISPARITIES: PERCEPTIONS AND MANAGEMENT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Pediatric asthma, the most common chronic illness of childhood, is increasing in prevalence, morbidity and mortality : particularly in minority children.  This application seeks to establish the Rhode Island : Puerto Rico Asthma Center (RIPRAC) for reducing disparities in asthma among Latino children.  Brown University faculty involved with an extensive pediatric asthma research program will join with epidemiologists, clinicians, and health services researchers from the minority serving University of Puerto Rico to study potentially overlooked determinants of disparity.  An ambitious training component (based on a successful T32 research training program) will involve individuals from both sites at both sites.  The RIPRAC Research AIMS include four projects that seek to understand the causes of disparities at multiple levels : the biomedical, the individual/family, and the socioenvironmental level.  The four projects, respectively, will 1) examine discrepancies between the diagnosis of asthma as assessed by parental report, the primary care medical record and our systematic diagnosis base on the NHLBI guidelines; 2) assess characteristics (prescription practices, shared decision making, continuity and access to care) of the health care system that may differentially affect asthma morbidity; 3) evaluate family beliefs, the burden of asthma management and medication adherence as they affect asthma morbidity and health care utilization in Latino and Anglo children; and 4) study the relation of symptom perception to pediatric asthma discrepancies.  Subjects for all 4 projects will be the same 300 mainland Anglos, 200 mainland Latinos (of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent) and 400 island Puerto Rico children with asthma, aged 7-15, thereby promoting comparability and efficiency.  Chi-square analyses and ANOVA's will be used to assess differences between groups; techniques of logistic regression and multiple regression will be used to model the effects of covariates.  The RIPRAC Training component will provide clinical research education and supervision to Puerto Rican trainees and faculty, enhance cultural awareness of Brown personnel as it relates to asthma disparities, and launch at least three trainee-led pilot research projects in the area.

"Adult Asthma: Biology, Society and Environment   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental, biological, and                  psychosocial factors can all separately influence the disease burden in asthma.      As yet, no studies have taken into account all three categories of factors           together, to examine their relative contributions to the disease burden and          investigate whether their cumulative effects can explain the health disparities      of at-risk populations, either additively or synergistically. Asthma is an           ideal chronic condition in which to delineate the potential linkages among           biological mechanisms, social factors, and physical environments and, more           specifically, to show how these linkages may lead to health disparities. Study       Hypotheses: 1) There are socioeconomic status (SES) differentials in the             disease burden of asthma; 2) Environmental, biological, and psychosocial             factors are linked to the asthma disease burden additively, if not                   synergistically; and 3) The variance in SES differentials of disease burden          will be substantially explained by modeling that takes specific environmental,       biological, and psychosocial factors into account. Methods: This proposed study      will make use of an established panel of 590 adults with asthma of varying           severity. We propose to supplement these survey data with 500 home site visits       in which we will directly gather environmental, biological, and psychosocial         data. Specific environmental risk factors we will quantify include: allergen         sensitization, home allergens, ETS exposure, and indoor air quality. We will         also assess perceived stress and social support. In addition, we will link           subjects to other potential exposures through external data sets. We will also       administer a follow-up survey to investigate the combined influence of               environmental, biological, and psychosocial exposures in explaining SES              disparities in the disease burden of asthma. This study combines a                   multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in clinical medicine,           social sciences, epidemiology, psychology, endocrinology, asthma treatment and       prevention, and biostatistics. Anticipated Results and Significance: The             proposed investigation will have sufficient power to detect differences in the       proportions of outcomes between two groups in the range of 10-15 percent at the      0.05 level for dichotomous outcomes.

"Genetics of Asthma In Latino Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma prevalence, morbidity and mortality are higher among Latino Americans on the east coast than on the west coast of the U.S. This is in stark contrast to the near geographic uniformity of asthma morbidity and mortality rates among African Americans and Caucasians in the U.S. The differences in asthma prevalence and severity among Latino Americans on the two coasts may reflect differences in the genetic contributions of Ancestral Native American, Spanish and African populations to the Latino population on the east coast (predominantly Puerto Rican) and west coast (predominantly Mexican). To determine whether identifiable genetic factors are associated with asthma and severe asthma among Mexican Americans, the largest U.S. Hispanic group, we will recruit Mexican American asthmatic subjects (probands) and their biologic parents (n=600) from California during a 1 year period. Probands will undergo formal phenotypic characterization. We will assemble a repository of DNA and plasma from the probands and their parents. We will identify novel single nucleotide plymorphisms (SNPs) among candidate genes at loci where there is evidence to suggest linkage to asthma in previous studies of other populations. We will determine whether novel SNPs and SNPs known to be associated with asthma in other populations are associated with asthma in Mexican Americans. We will compare the results generated from this repository to similar ongoing studies in Puerto Rican asthmatic families. The creation of a repository of DNA from well-characterized Mexican American asthmatics will enable future analysis of other genes identified in other studies. The results of this work may have important implications for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of asthma not only in Mexican Americans, but in other populations as well. The proposed research project is one component of a career development plan designed to prepare the applicant to lead an independent program applying novel advances in genomics to improving the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in medically underserved populations. The training component of this application includes oversight from an experienced pulmonary physician-scientist (Dr. Dean Sheppard), with a strong track-record in training successful pulmonary academicians, formal mentoring from a multidisciplinary scientific advisory committee, all collaborators from GALA, and advanced didactic training in clinical research design and genetic association studies.

"SOCIAL FACTORS & THE ENVIRONMENT IN PEDIATRIC ASTHMA   DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigators' Abstract)                                                                                                                      Asthma is an increasingly common, complex condition with rising morbidity and        mortality.  Racial disparities in pediatric asthma prevalence and severity           indicate higher rates among indigent, non-Caucasians living in urban                 communities.  The greatest proportional increase in deaths due to asthma has         occurred in the 10-14 year-old age range.  This proposal studies the racial          disparities in pediatric asthma outcome among low income African American,           Latino, and Caucasian elementary school-aged children.  The goal is to clarify       the biologic and environmental, as well as the social and behavioral,                processes that lead to these disparities.                                                                                                                                 Asthma screening will be done at three sets of six elementary schools as a           service to the schools.  Parents returning the screen will serve as the              population from which three cohorts of elementary school-aged children will be       recruited, one in each of the first three years of the project.  The screen          yields three groups of children in each cohort:  one group that has previously       diagnosed asthma, a second group that has possible, undiagnosed asthma               (positive screens), and a third group that has no evidence of asthma symptoms        (negative screen).  The children screening positive will be followed every six       months for 12 months to obtain three additional points of data.  A random            sample from those who screen negative for asthma will be recruited as a              comparison group for the first data point only.                                                                                                                           Information gathered at the three time points include 1) information on              childhood asthma control (health services utilization and symptoms) and              general physical health, and 2) caregiver life stressors, physical health, and       depression.  Time points 1 and 3 (T1 and T3) are telephone interviews.  Also         at T1, children who screened positive for asthma will have allergy testing at        school for common respiratory allergies.  The interview at time point 2 (T2)         is conducted during a home visit, at which time a home environmental screen is       conducted and two dust samples collected and later analyzed for dust mite,           cockroach, and cat antigens.  Also at T3 (one year after the screening results                                                   are returned), parents will be interviewed about how they made the decision          whether or not to seek care, from whom, and with what success.  Selected             healthcare providers will be sent a questionnaire regarding the children's           care.  All stages of the project include a Community Outreach and Education          Plan, culminating in community meetings in the final year to share results and       consider next steps.

"DISPARITIES IN ASTHMA AMONG ELDERLY IN WEST TEXAS The prevalence of asthma has been increasing both in the US and worldwide. The prevalence increased by 75% in the U.S. from 1980 to1994. The prevalence of asthma among elderly aged 65 and above is reported to be 7% to 10%. However, this estimate may be an underestimate since there is evidence that asthma is under-diagnosed in the elderly. Hispanics are the fastest growing minority in the US, yet very few studies involve Hispanic samples, especially the elderly. The Texas Tech 5000 survey is a large population based longitudinal epidemiological study of 5000 elderly West Texas residents. The Texas Tech 5000 sample was randomly selected from residential household telephone listings in the 108 counties of West Texas. We propose to conduct a secondary data analysis of the wave-3 of the Texas Tech 5000 survey, which will permit us to assess the prevalence, predictors, and consequences of asthma, asthma symptoms and allergy in this population. The wave-3 of the Texas Tech 5000 survey was conducted from October 20001 through December 2001. A total of 3392 subjects participated in the survey for a response rate of 86.7%. The sample includes approximately 12% Hispanics. The specific objectives of this analysis are 1) to estimate and compare the  revalence of asthma, asthma symptoms, and allergies among the elderly persons, 2) to test hypotheses that asthma symptoms are less likely to result in medical assessment, diagnosis and treatment among Hispanic elderly persons and among elderly persons in rural areas, 3) to assess impact of asthma and asthma symptoms on daily life, using generic (SF-12) and asthma specific health related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire, and 4) to determine and compare the average cost of prescription medicine used by subjects with and without asthma and how the cost of medication affects quality of life. To define asthma, two operational definitions will be used: definite asthma (based on physician-diagnosis) and probable asthma (based on asthma symptoms). Mean scores on health related quality of life, and mean number of physician office visits will be computed and compared among subjects with and without asthma. The association between asthma (definite and probable) and independent variables grouped into five categories: 1) socio-demographic variables, 2) environmental and household characteristics, 3) allergies, 4) asthma symptoms, and 5) health care access, will be analyzed using logistic regression. Proportion of elderly Hispanics and non-Hispanic subjects with asthma symptoms will be compared with regard to health care access, including medical assessment and diagnosis using chi-square statistics. A similar comparison will be made to evaluate urban/rural differences.

"Adult Asthma: Biology, Society and Environment   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental, biological, and                  psychosocial factors can all separately influence the disease burden in asthma.      As yet, no studies have taken into account all three categories of factors           together, to examine their relative contributions to the disease burden and          investigate whether their cumulative effects can explain the health disparities      of at-risk populations, either additively or synergistically. Asthma is an           ideal chronic condition in which to delineate the potential linkages among           biological mechanisms, social factors, and physical environments and, more           specifically, to show how these linkages may lead to health disparities. Study       Hypotheses: 1) There are socioeconomic status (SES) differentials in the             disease burden of asthma; 2) Environmental, biological, and psychosocial             factors are linked to the asthma disease burden additively, if not                   synergistically; and 3) The variance in SES differentials of disease burden          will be substantially explained by modeling that takes specific environmental,       biological, and psychosocial factors into account. Methods: This proposed study      will make use of an established panel of 590 adults with asthma of varying           severity. We propose to supplement these survey data with 500 home site visits       in which we will directly gather environmental, biological, and psychosocial         data. Specific environmental risk factors we will quantify include: allergen         sensitization, home allergens, ETS exposure, and indoor air quality. We will         also assess perceived stress and social support. In addition, we will link           subjects to other potential exposures through external data sets. We will also       administer a follow-up survey to investigate the combined influence of               environmental, biological, and psychosocial exposures in explaining SES              disparities in the disease burden of asthma. This study combines a                   multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in clinical medicine,           social sciences, epidemiology, psychology, endocrinology, asthma treatment and       prevention, and biostatistics. Anticipated Results and Significance: The             proposed investigation will have sufficient power to detect differences in the       proportions of outcomes between two groups in the range of 10-15 percent at the      0.05 level for dichotomous outcomes.

"Cumulative Risks and Asthma Morbidity in Urban Children DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) Asthma is a childhood chronic illness that is over-represented in children from low income, urban, and ethnic minority backgrounds in the U.S. (USDHHS, 2000). The steady increase in asthma morbidity and mortality rates among children within this demographic profile has been identified as a significant national health concern. A major research priority for NIH is to understand how to decrease the health disparities between ethnic minority, low-income children and their healthier, white counterparts. The present study will examine the relationship between the cumulative impact of multiple risks associated with urban poverty and asthma morbidity in African-American, Hispanic, and non- Hispanic, white children (N= 150, 50 families in each ethnic group). Specifically, the development and validation of a Cumulative Risk Index (CRI) will be employed to investigate whether asthma morbidity in urban children is more adequately predicted by risk models that include multiple dimensions of factors that may function as risks (cultural, contextual, asthma-specific) for urban families. Urban and low-income, 7-11 year old children with asthma and their primary caregivers will participate in interview-based assessments. The current study will be integrated into an NIH funded Center for Asthma Disparities (U01-HIO72438-01; Principal Investigator Gregory Fritz) at Brown Medical School. Results from this study will enable future studies testing moderators that may enhance asthma-related functioning in urban children.

"Bridging the Gap: A Relationship Approach to Asthma Care DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  Socio-economic status is an important risk factor for asthma. Evidence suggests that excess morbidity and mortality from asthma in inner-city areas of large American cities is associated with social disadvantage. Socio-economic factors such as poverty, low level of education and minority status, underlie the disparity between health provider expectations and patient compliance.  This application intends to reduce the gap between community-based providers and their asthma patients by: (1) improving provider - patient communication, (2) promoting more effective relationships among the various providers that interact with patients, and (3) encouraging providers to become more involved in the communities they serve.  An effective educational intervention for health providers who treat inner city, ethnic populations with asthma would be very desirable. This Phase I application proposes the development of a sample video and supporting written material based on the principles of Relationship-Centered Care, an approach to health care that encourages providers to develop meaningful relationships with their patients, their colleagues and their service communities. Improvements in these areas can increase levels of satisfaction in providers and patients, an outcome that has been shown to enhance health status.

"Asthma Disparities in Cohorts at Risk for Morbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The goals of this Center are to determine the mechanisms underlying the disparities in asthma, and to improve asthma care in a targeted group at high risk for asthma-specific, maternal and perinatal complications, pregnant women with asthma. The proposed Meharry-Vanderbilt Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities entitled Asthma Disparities in Cohorts at Risk for Morbidity@ is a joint collaborative effort produced in the context of a formal alliance between the institutions, the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance. This Alliance commits the two institutions to learn from each other for the benefit of student education, patient care, and research progress. The Alliance has already established NIH funding, organized community outreach, and formalized institutional cross training. The proposed Center would be a natural extension of Alliance goals and methods. The training projects were developed jointly to optimize the unique values of the minority serving institution, Meharry Medical College, and the research intensive institution, Vanderbilt University. Funds are dedicated for summer research experiences for medical students and for pilot investigations relevant to asthma disparities. This proposal targets minority groups at risk of significant asthma-related morbidity: pregnant women, children requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and asthmatics requiring emergency care. A controlled randomized trial of the relative efficacy of two culturally sensitive asthma education and smoking cessation programs will target pregnant women with asthma of black or Hispanic race/ethnicity. Simultaneously, the same investigators will examine asthma-related morbidity in a large cohort of pregnant women utilizing administrative data and vital records. Perceptions of asthma severity and ways to describe it appear to differ in Blacks compared to whites. Therefore we will convene focus groups of patients and families attending the emergency room to validate a culturally sensitive instrument to allow improved descriptors of asthma severity for Blacks. Estimates by the patients of asthma severity will be matched to objective measures, and compared with those of whites. This methodology will then be used to extend the hypothesis to children admitted with severe asthma to the region=s only pediatric ICU. In the pediatric ICU, the admission rates and outcomes will be associated with the potentially important genetic variations in the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (BADR2). Using parents and non-affected siblings as case controls, a novel computational method will test for gene-gene interactions that explain a genetic basis for asthma disparities in severe asthma. These interrelated projects jointly conducted by investigators from each institution will illuminate the mechanisms responsible for asthma disparities and provide novel interventions in targeted minority groups at risk for morbidity from asthma.

"Family Resources and Demands on Caregiver's Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective is to gain information, which will be useful in designing culturally appropriate interventions for families who care for children with moderate to severe asthma. The specific aims of this study are: to compare family resources and family demands of African American and Euro-American parents of school-age children with moderate to severe asthma; to determine the relationship between family resources and family demands; and to examine both direct and moderating effects of family resources, family demands and family coping on family well-being. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and the documented disparities in the African American population underscore the significance of this study. Yet, little is known about family caregiving activities for a child with asthma. This three year descriptive, comparative, cross sectional study will be comprised of 150 families of children diagnosed with moderate to severe asthma. A convenience sample will be recruited from a health care agency, which serves children with moderate to severe asthma. The criteria for inclusion in the study are: the caregiving family contains at least one adult who shares a home with the care recipient and others and defines themselves as a family; the caregiving parent provides assistance with at least one health care management activity; the care recipient is a child between 6-to-11 years old living in the home with a diagnosis of asthma; and the caregiver must be able to read and speak English. The project coordinator will initially identify and recruit potential subjects for the study. Those wishing to participate will notify the coordinator giving her permission to release information to the PI. Each parent who agrees to participate will sign a consent form and upon completion of the questionnaires will be given a gift participation certificate.

"Enhancing Prevention for Children in Diverse Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background and Candidate. Understanding and eliminating disparities in health is a national priority.  Black and Latino children bear a disproportionate burden of asthma, a leading cause of childhood morbidity.  Yet, minority children are less likely to be using appropriate preventive medications than white children.  This application requests a mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research (K24) for Dr. Tracy Lieu, MD, MPH, a nationally recognized pediatric health services researcher. Dr. Lieu has recently become Director of the new Center for Child Health Care Studies in her department at Harvard. Her goal is to enhance the adoption of effective preventive health interventions for children, especially minority children.  Her record demonstrates high productivity in funded research in asthma and vaccines.  Mentoring Plan. Dr. Lieu has a growing track record of mentoring and excellent opportunities to work with beginning investigators. She is responsible for three of the junior faculty in her new Center, all of whom are within their first three years. She is also the Children's Hospital Site Director of the Harvard Pediatric Health Services Research Fellowship Program. This K24 award is needed to protect Dr. Lieu's time for guiding these beginning investigators as they establish their research portfolios.      Research Plan. The proposed research in this K24 award builds on Dr. Lieu's ongoing NICHD-supported R01 on racial/ethnic disparities in medication use by children with persistent asthma. The aims are to:   1. Conduct a prospective cohort study to evaluate parent-provider communication patterns and health beliefs as predictors of preventive medication adoption and influenza vaccination among black, Latino, and white children with persistent asthma; and   2. Analyze existing data to identify practice site policies as well as clinician and patient-level predictors of preventive medication adoption among a diverse group of children with persistent asthma.      Summary.

"Communities Organized Against Asthma and Lead (COAL) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Communities Organized Against Asthma and Lead: Project COAL (Communidades organizadas contra asthma y plomo) will be a partnership between De Madres a Madres, Inc. in Houston, TX, The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Casa de Amigos Health Center, and the Environmental Justice Clinic at Texas Southern University School of Law.  The partnership will bring together a well-established and respected community based organization in the Near North Side community of Houston, with Environmental Toxicologists in the NIEHS Center at UTMB, health care providers at the Harris County Hospital District Clinic serving the Near North Side, and attorneys and law students with a history of response to environmental health problems in disadvantaged communities.  This partnership will address two pressing environmental problems in the homes of this community: exposure of children to lead, from paint, and to agents that can trigger asthma.  We will address these issues first through a novel approach to communication using theater as a means to educate and to elicit responses from the community.  This approach will inform the community about Project COAL and provide local knowledge from the community to the partners in this project.  The second focus of the project will be to serve the needs of residents in the community by making assessments of their homes to identify sources of lead and agents that can trigger asthma.  Paint samples will be tested for lead.  Levels of allergens (dust mites, mold spores, pollen) in the air will be determined, irritant chemicals and allergens from insects and rodents will be measured.  UTMB will train local resident home assessment teams and perform the laboratory tests.  Residents will be given training to enable them to reduce or eliminate these hazards from their homes and they will receive consistent follow-up from the home assessment teams.  The medical clinic and environmental justice clinic will serve in an advisory capacity and provide data about the community, and assist in specific situations when the need arises.  The primary purpose of Project COAL is to give De Madres a Madres the means to provide services to reduce the exposure of children in their community to agents that can result in lead exposure and asthma exacerbation.

"IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN US LATINO CHILDREN I am applying for this 5-year K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award to support and facilitate my development as a health services researcher and speed my transition to an independent investigator.  This award will allow me to complete my training in health services methods and provide me with the protected time to assure my publication and grant-making productivity during a pivotal period.  I have begun to establish myself as a minority researcher concerned with disparities in health care delivery and outcomes in children through work in 3 areas: 1) analyzing access and quality of care barriers associated with higher asthma morbidity in poor and minority children with asthma; (2) improving survey methods for evaluating morbidity and risk factors associated with asthma, paying particular attention to challenges posed by English/Spanish bilingualism and by the need to incorporate perspectives of both parents and child, and (3) reviewing the existing literature regarding differences in asthma morbidity among Latino children with asthma.  Founded on this work and with the guidance of my mentors, Dr. Robert Brook and Dr. Harold Morgenstern, I will continue to develop a research career whose long-term goal is to improve health outcomes and quality of life in Latino children with asthma through evidence-based health care and community- based interventions. The short-term objectives of this 5-year career development award are to: 1) obtain additional formal training in quality of care, statistical, study design, and epidemiological methods, 2) complete a period of supervised experience in analyses of existing datasets to enhance my analytic skills and increase my publication record, 3) submit at least 2 R01 applications to carry out the next phase of my investigations, and 4) continue to develop the community-based and research infrastructure necessary for my research.  The specific aims of my intended R01 funded research include to: 1) develop and evaluate a combined health care and school community-based intervention to ensure access to high-quality primary care for Latino and other children with asthma, and 2) identify the factors, such as differences in primary care health care use and socio-demographic risks, that are associated with variations in asthma prevalence and morbidity among US children of Puerto Rican, Mexican, Cuban, and other Latino heritage.

"HOWARD/HOPKINS CENTER FOR REDUCING ASTHMA DISPARTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma and marked   improvements in the therapies available to treat asthma, disadvantaged and minority communities still carry a disproportionate burden from asthma. The exact reasons for this phenomenon are unknown, however, a number of factors have been proposed to account for this disparity, including genetic differences in vulnerability to asthma or asthma severity, differential rates of environmental exposure (e.g. cockroaches, dust), differences in the accessibility and quality of asthma medical care for patients of differing socioeconomic status, and inadequate asthma self-management practices, including poor adherence with therapy. It is widely believed that these factors interact to cause the observed excess burden of asthma within low-income, minority populations. Howard University and Johns Hopkins University have a long and successful history of collaborative studies designed to evaluate asthma morbidity in low-income, African-American children and adults with asthma. This application draws on this rich history to propose the formal collaboration of these institutions and investigators as a part of the Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities. Specifically, this application presents four research projects designed to collaboratively investigate factors associated with the disproportionate burden of asthma experienced by inner-city, African-American children and adults. This application includes studies that will evaluate both the underlying genetic factors that may contribute to the observed excess risk in African-American communities, as well as studies of provider-patient communication designed to assess intervention strategies for remediating this risk. In addition, an essential goal of the Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities will be to create a culturally sensitive training environment that is truly reciprocal, and designed to both enrich and enhance the research potential and asthma management capabilities of both participating institutions.

"Communication, Perspectives, & Child Asthma Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care is a national priority.  Minority children bear a disproportionate share of the burden of asthma, a leading cause of childhood morbidity.  Recent studies have found that African-American and Latino children are less likely to be using needed preventive asthma medications than White children are, even when health insurance is equalized.  Culturally tailored interventions hold promise to close such gaps.  However, scant information is available to suggest how such interventions should be designed.   Specific Aims and Research Plan.  This innovative project will pair qualitative and quantitative methods to study African-American, Latino, and White children with persistent asthma.  We will: 1.  Identify elements of effective communication in clinical interactions; 2.  Determine other key factors leading to under-use of preventive medications; and 3.  Lay the foundation for developing tools to enhance effective clinical decision-making that incorporates parent and child perspectives.  In the Qualitative Phase, we will audiotape clinical interactions and conduct semi-structured interviews with parents and providers.  The qualitative results will suggest specific possible interventions to reduce disparities.  In the subsequent Survey Phase, we will test the generalizability of hypotheses from the qualitative research.  We will conduct a retrospective cohort study in two large, diverse populations, linking data from telephone interviews with parents, surveys of providers, and computerized data on asthma medications and other health care use.  The unique strengths of this research include our ability to study the parent-child-provider interaction using different and complementary data sources, our access to computerized data, and our plan to identify areas of similarity and contrast among different racial/ethnic groups using both qualitative and quantitative methods.    Projected Findings and Policy Implications: Our results will identify specific elements of effective communication and decision making for African-American, Latino, and White families.  This information is critical to the design of effective, culturally tailored interventions to eliminate disparities in health care for childhood asthma and other chronic diseases.         ","Communication, Perspectives, & Child Asthma Disparities",6752913,R01HD044070,"['child (0-11) ', ' health education ', ' human subject ', ' asthma ', ' informatics ', ' epidemiology ', ' health survey ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' chemoprevention ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' communication ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2004,494825,0.20938232709136415
"EFFICACY OF WRITTEN TREATMENT PLANS IN ASTHMA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective self-management of asthma requires that patients or their caregivers recognize the early symptoms of an exacerbation and initiate appropriate interventions aimed at preventing the progression of symptoms. Most asthma clinical guidelines suggest that the incorporation of a written self-management plan is an essential tool that patients must possess, be able to understand, and follow if they are to respond appropriately to changes in asthma status. Nevertheless, there are no controlled trials examining the efficacy of the written plan itself. Furthermore, even if written plans are an essential and an effective component of successful self-management, the data suggest that few patients receive them. Barriers to the use of written plans need more study if patients and physicians are to increase their use of this tool. Additionally, studies are needed to examine the efficacy of written plans across different patient populations. The overall goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of a model, written treatment plan in a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) compared with the usual care that is provided by a group of adult and pediatric pulmonologists and allergists in their practice settings. The model plan is a form that allows a treatment regimen consistent with NHLBI guidelines to be conveyed to patients. An additional goal is to assess how patients from different racial/ethnic backgrounds utilize treatments plans. Specific aims: 1) to identify barriers to the use of written plans and determine whether these barriers differ across racial/ethnic groups; 2) to develop, validate, and pilot test a model written treatment plan form plus instructions to doctors for its use; and 3) to conduct a RCT of the model plan form with African-American, Latino, and non-Latino white patients to: a) assess the efficacy of the plan across patient populations and b) determine if using written plans reduce racial/ethnic disparities in asthma outcomes. We hypothesize that patients with asthma who receive the model written plan form will have, relative to patients in the control group, significantly greater improvement in 3 primary outcome measures: 1.1) reduction in asthma symptom frequency; 1.2) reduction in emergency use of health care services; and 1.3) improved quality of life. We will also examine 4 secondary outcome measures: 1.4) asthma hospitalizations; 1.5) days with activity restriction; 1.6) the proportion of patients in the intervention group who receive the plan during the initial visit; and 1.7) use of the plans by patients.         ",EFFICACY OF WRITTEN TREATMENT PLANS IN ASTHMA,6790593,R01HL073955,"['patient care management ', ' patient care planning ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care personnel performance ', ' human subject ', ' asthma ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,696920,0.31828880405636656
"Chicago Initiative to Raise Asthma Health Equity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Over the past decade there has been a heightened awareness of the disproportionate impact of asthma morbidity and mortality among African Americans and persons of lower social economic status.  The causes underlying this disparity have not been fully elucidated.  However, there is strong evidence that the levels of social stress imposed by this condition and the degree of coping and self-management skills present are factors that may be particularly important in explaining these disparities.  The purpose of this project is to develop a collaborative research program between Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Cook County Hospital to fully characterize the relationship of social stress, coping, and self-regulatory health behaviors in the context of asthma disparities among African American and low income populations.  Once characterized, the project will then develop and test an intervention strategy to reduce asthma disparities in high-risk populations based on evidence-based models that have demonstrated success in social work, nursing, and community interventions.  There are four research aims for this proposed Center of Excellence.  (1) To develop and validate culturally appropriate psychosocial instruments related to the underlying causes of disparity in asthma morbidity (2) To identify the structural relationships of psychosocial factors to other known influential factors related to disparities in asthma outcomes.  (3) To study the changes in structural relationship among influential factors in asthma disparity over time as related to changes in health status.  (4) To develop, pilot test, and field test a community-based asthma team (peer coach, asthma nurse, and social worker) intervention to enhance individuals ability to cope with chronic illness and improve asthma-related behaviors.

"Web-based Asthma Education for Urban Head Start Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing asthma prevalence and hospitalization rates of preschool children (ages 3-5) signal a major public health problem that requires early intervention. Evidence of health disparities and unequal treatment among low-income, urban, minority preschoolers with asthma underscores the need to develop culturally sensitive asthma interventions in community-based programs, such as Head Start, that work with high risk preschool children and their families. All of the family caregivers and child care providers who work with preschoolers need to know how to prevent and manage asthma episodes, yet little is known about the informational needs of ethnic minority parents of preschoolers with asthma or child care providers in different settings. Because preschoolers must rely on caregivers in different settings to help them manage their asthma, an ecological approach to asthma management guides this study. Using a participatory action research methodology, the investigators will partner with parents who have preschoolers with asthma and are enrolled in Ramsey Action Program (RAP) Head Start programs in St. Paul, Minnesota and Head Start staff to develop an action plan to address parent- and staff-identified needs. The short-term goals of this pilot project are: 1) to determine the asthma information and resource needs of parents from ethnically diverse backgrounds and Head Start staff who care for preschoolers, and 2) to determine the feasibility of providing culturally sensitive, web-based asthma education to Head Start parents and staff by designing and evaluating a preliminary asthma information web site for Head Start based on identified needs.

"Determinants of asthma severity in Harlem (DASH) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent rise in asthma morbidity and mortality has impacted the African American population disproportionately. It is likely that in addition to environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility factors have contributed to this disparity. Little is known, however, about how specific genetic polymorphisms, including those on chromosome 5q, impact the pathogenesis of asthma. Though the prevalence of specific polymorphisms (allelic variants) is known to vary across populations (population stratification), genetic studies on asthma in African Americans have characteristically included small numbers, and inadequate controls. Moreover, there is almost no information about the immunological pathways that contribute to asthma severity in this population. Our study, DASH (Determinants of Asthma Severity in Harlem), seeks to establish the link between specific genotypic variants and phenotypic markers, and to elucidate immunological pathways that contribute to asthma severity in an African American population. DASH addresses the next step in reaching our long-range goal, i.e., to control asthma in the African American population of Harlem. We propose a case-control study of individuals of African American heritage, who live in Central and West Harlem. We will test our central hypothesis: Polymorphisms in candidate asthma genes on chromosome 5g modify disease severity in individuals who have asthma, and these polymorphisms and specific T cell response phenotypes differ between individuals who have asthma and those who do not. The research plan will address the following specific aims: (1) to define the phenotype and allelic variants of the IL-4, IL-13 and Beta2-adrenoreceptor genes among African American asthmatic individuals (cases) and controls; and (2) to define T cell response phenotypes among African Americans who have asthma. The DASH study represents the largest effort undertaken to date, to study the genetics of asthma in an African American population; and it seeks to elucidate important immunological mechanisms (T-cell responses) that contribute to asthma severity. Moreover, it enables the linkage of T-cell responses to specific allelic variants. Our approach is to apply modern technologies (haplotype analysis; immunophenotyping) toward development of a mechanism-based framework for understanding pathways that underlie asthma severity in the African American population. The data collected through the DASH study will elucidate the relevance of emerging directions for asthma management, including pharmacogenetic strategies, for this population. The potential public health benefits are critical for the asthmatic population in general.

"Airway Disease and Cockroach Exposure in Public Housing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma morbidity and mortality in poor, urban populations is unacceptably high.  We and others have proposed that allergic sensitization to cockroaches may contribute to this problem.  New analysis of our previously completed study of asthmatic adolescents shows even stronger association between indices of asthma severity and cockroach allergy.  However, further in-depth assessment is required for the development of environmental policies and urban housing planning that address cockroach infestation in the context of respiratory health.  The current grant was designed to provide additional evidence supporting the causal relationship between asthma morbidity and cockroach allergy/exposure.  In the first period of this project, the data we have generated through a complete survey of the Claremont public housing complex in Baltimore City indicate that the prevalence of asthma in this population is much higher than the national average.  In addition, we find that 60% of asthmatics in this population are sensitized to cockroaches.  We continue our strong collaboration with the Housing Authority of Baltimore City and we are in the process of beginning our work in the O'Donnell Heights complex.  This development is scheduled for demolition by the end of 2005, with new units available in 2007.  We request renewal of this grant with the following aims. In Aim 1, we will survey the entire O'Donnell population so that we have full asthma prevalence data of a representative sample of public housing residents.  Survey results will be validated with determination of airways responsiveness.  Within the O'Donnell population, we will perform a cross-sectional study in individuals with asthma evaluating risk factors for asthma morbidity with focus on cockroach and other allergen exposure, endotoxin exposure, exposure to indoor air pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10) and obesity.  To ascertain the relationship between the above risk factors and the presence of asthma, we will perform a case-control study involving the O'Donnell residents with asthma vs. a group of residents with lone rhinitis and a healthy group.  In Aim 2, we will monitor asthma morbidity longitudinally in all asthmatic residents of O'Donnell Heights, while they are relocated into new homes.  It is our hypothesis that those with cockroach allergy who will be relocated to cockroach-free environment will experience improvement in airway disease.  Aim 3, consists of a randomized, parallel study utilizing individuals relocating into the new units that are replacing the Claremont complex.  This study will test the effectiveness of an education/behavioral modification program, combined with precision-targeted early mitigation, against no intervention, in avoiding cockroach infestation of new homes. We hope that with the data to be generated, we will positively impact the health of urban US populations who are disproportionally suffering from asthma morbidity and mortality.

"Preventive Asthma Care Utilization among Black Children Epidemiological data suggests increased morbidity, prevalence and mortality associated with asthma among African-American children. This population tends to over-utilize the emergency department for asthma care although preventive asthma care within the primary care setting is more optimal to control and manage asthma-associated morbidity. Previous studies have suggested that racial differences in the rates of preventive asthma care utilization can be attributed to several factors, including the disparity in health insurance coverage between racial groups, social, financial and system barriers to preventive asthma care, and divergent health care seeking beliefs among African-American women. For my dissertation research, I plan to investigate how ""race"" when defined explicitly as social class, culturally derived health beliefs, and exposure to structural forces such as racism mediates my outcome of interest, utilization of preventive asthma care.

"Social Support and Education in Asthma Follow-Up    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our previous NHLBI-supported study (HL 57232) showed that a combination treatment of ""Coaching"" through follow-up phone calls 2 and 5 days following an index ED visit plus monetary incentive was highly effective in increasing the percentage of low-income urban children who received recommended primary care within 2 weeks of the ED visit for asthma, 44% in the intervention group vs 29% in usual care (p = 0.0004). However, the intervention was not associated with significant differences in morbidity (subsequent ED visits). We conclude that the intervention was effective in promoting the initial link to primary care, but was not effective in sustaining that link or management practices to minimize acuity of symptoms during exacerbation. Here we propose an expansion of the intervention initiated at the time of an ED visit for asthma to promote ongoing primary care and effective asthma management. Parents of low-income, urban, predominantly African American children, aged 2 - 12 years will be recruited at the time of their children's ED visits for acute wheezing. The experimental Intervention is designed to reduce morbidity from recurrent asthma through ongoing education and social support to encourage long-term primary care and adherence to recommended asthma management practices. It will include: 1) as in our previous study, monetary incentive to visit the PCP in order to start the process of ongoing care; 2) as in our previous study, contact by an asthma ""Coach,"" but now extended through 12 months following the ED visit and focusing not only on attending primary care as recommended but also on parent adherence to asthma management strategies developed with the primary care provider (PCP); and 3) telemedicine provided by asthma nurses to reinforce asthma management strategies and assess the status of the child's asthma continued through 6 months following the index ED visit. After informed consent, cases will be randomly assigned to either Usual Care or Intervention, stratified by PCP clinic. All children will receive standardized/usual ED care to resolve wheezing and standardized discharge advice. Follow-up to assess study outcomes will be scheduled every 6 months from the time of randomization of each case and continue for 24 months following randomization. Intended impacts on patterns of care will be assessed by proportions of children who have a visit to their PCP for asthma planning within 2 weeks after the index ED visit and [3]1 subsequent PCP visit for regular care that includes asthma planning during the 24 months of follow-up. Primary outcome will be asthma morbidity, as indexed by the proportion of children who have at least one ED visit during the 24-month follow-up period. Additional outcomes will include the proportion of children who have at least 1 hospitalization, the proportion of participants with [3]1 visit to the PCP for acute asthma, and the net cost of asthma-related care, all through the 24 months of intervention and follow-up. Planned enrolment is 248 subjects (124 per group) to provide 80% power at p = .05 to detect a reduction of ED visits of 20%. Because the primary outcome can be obtained from medical records after consent even if phone contact cannot be maintained, intent to treat model will be used for analyses.

"Adult Asthma: Biology, Society and Environment   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental, biological, and                  psychosocial factors can all separately influence the disease burden in asthma.      As yet, no studies have taken into account all three categories of factors           together, to examine their relative contributions to the disease burden and          investigate whether their cumulative effects can explain the health disparities      of at-risk populations, either additively or synergistically. Asthma is an           ideal chronic condition in which to delineate the potential linkages among           biological mechanisms, social factors, and physical environments and, more           specifically, to show how these linkages may lead to health disparities. Study       Hypotheses: 1) There are socioeconomic status (SES) differentials in the             disease burden of asthma; 2) Environmental, biological, and psychosocial             factors are linked to the asthma disease burden additively, if not                   synergistically; and 3) The variance in SES differentials of disease burden          will be substantially explained by modeling that takes specific environmental,       biological, and psychosocial factors into account. Methods: This proposed study      will make use of an established panel of 590 adults with asthma of varying           severity. We propose to supplement these survey data with 500 home site visits       in which we will directly gather environmental, biological, and psychosocial         data. Specific environmental risk factors we will quantify include: allergen         sensitization, home allergens, ETS exposure, and indoor air quality. We will         also assess perceived stress and social support. In addition, we will link           subjects to other potential exposures through external data sets. We will also       administer a follow-up survey to investigate the combined influence of               environmental, biological, and psychosocial exposures in explaining SES              disparities in the disease burden of asthma. This study combines a                   multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in clinical medicine,           social sciences, epidemiology, psychology, endocrinology, asthma treatment and       prevention, and biostatistics. Anticipated Results and Significance: The             proposed investigation will have sufficient power to detect differences in the       proportions of outcomes between two groups in the range of 10-15 percent at the      0.05 level for dichotomous outcomes. This project addresses a major research         need and can be a basis for the development of public policies to address            environmentally related and other health disparities in adult asthma.

"Genetics of Asthma In Latino Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma prevalence, morbidity and mortality are higher among Latino Americans on the east coast than on the west coast of the U.S. This is in stark contrast to the near geographic uniformity of asthma morbidity and mortality rates among African Americans and Caucasians in the U.S. The differences in asthma prevalence and severity among Latino Americans on the two coasts may reflect differences in the genetic contributions of Ancestral Native American, Spanish and African populations to the Latino population on the east coast (predominantly Puerto Rican) and west coast (predominantly Mexican). To determine whether identifiable genetic factors are associated with asthma and severe asthma among Mexican Americans, the largest U.S. Hispanic group, we will recruit Mexican American asthmatic subjects (probands) and their biologic parents (n=600) from California during a 1 year period. Probands will undergo formal phenotypic characterization. We will assemble a repository of DNA and plasma from the probands and their parents. We will identify novel single nucleotide plymorphisms (SNPs) among candidate genes at loci where there is evidence to suggest linkage to asthma in previous studies of other populations. We will determine whether novel SNPs and SNPs known to be associated with asthma in other populations are associated with asthma in Mexican Americans. We will compare the results generated from this repository to similar ongoing studies in Puerto Rican asthmatic families. The creation of a repository of DNA from well-characterized Mexican American asthmatics will enable future analysis of other genes identified in other studies. The results of this work may have important implications for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of asthma not only in Mexican Americans, but in other populations as well. The proposed research project is one component of a career development plan designed to prepare the applicant to lead an independent program applying novel advances in genomics to improving the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in medically underserved populations. The training component of this application includes oversight from an experienced pulmonary physician-scientist (Dr. Dean Sheppard), with a strong track-record in training successful pulmonary academicians, formal mentoring from a multidisciplinary scientific advisory committee, all collaborators from GALA, and advanced didactic training in clinical research design and genetic association studies. This proposal?s focus is consistent with the goal established by Healthy People 2010, to reduce disparities in health among different populations.

"SOCIAL FACTORS & THE ENVIRONMENT IN PEDIATRIC ASTHMA   DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigators' Abstract)                                                                                                                      Asthma is an increasingly common, complex condition with rising morbidity and        mortality.  Racial disparities in pediatric asthma prevalence and severity           indicate higher rates among indigent, non-Caucasians living in urban                 communities.  The greatest proportional increase in deaths due to asthma has         occurred in the 10-14 year-old age range.  This proposal studies the racial          disparities in pediatric asthma outcome among low income African American,           Latino, and Caucasian elementary school-aged children.  The goal is to clarify       the biologic and environmental, as well as the social and behavioral,                processes that lead to these disparities.                                                                                                                                 Asthma screening will be done at three sets of six elementary schools as a           service to the schools.  Parents returning the screen will serve as the              population from which three cohorts of elementary school-aged children will be       recruited, one in each of the first three years of the project.  The screen          yields three groups of children in each cohort:  one group that has previously       diagnosed asthma, a second group that has possible, undiagnosed asthma               (positive screens), and a third group that has no evidence of asthma symptoms        (negative screen).  The children screening positive will be followed every six       months for 12 months to obtain three additional points of data.  A random            sample from those who screen negative for asthma will be recruited as a              comparison group for the first data point only.                                                                                                                           Information gathered at the three time points include 1) information on              childhood asthma control (health services utilization and symptoms) and              general physical health, and 2) caregiver life stressors, physical health, and       depression.  Time points 1 and 3 (T1 and T3) are telephone interviews.  Also         at T1, children who screened positive for asthma will have allergy testing at        school for common respiratory allergies.  The interview at time point 2 (T2)         is conducted during a home visit, at which time a home environmental screen is       conducted and two dust samples collected and later analyzed for dust mite,           cockroach, and cat antigens.  Also at T3 (one year after the screening results                                                   are returned), parents will be interviewed about how they made the decision          whether or not to seek care, from whom, and with what success.  Selected             healthcare providers will be sent a questionnaire regarding the children's           care.  All stages of the project include a Community Outreach and Education          Plan, culminating in community meetings in the final year to share results and       consider next steps.

"Improving Health Literacy to Reduce Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in asthma morbidity and mortality by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) have been repeatedly documented. Low literacy may contribute to asthma disparities, yet prior asthma interventions have not satisfactorily addressed this literacy barrier; even though as many as half of adults living with asthma and caregivers to children with asthma have limited literacy skills. Multimedia and enhanced print materials may be effective bridge tools to help community asthma workers and pharmacists convey asthma knowledge and teach proper self-management in a manner that is accessible to a lower literate audience. The purpose of this research is to support the mentorship and research training of Dr. Michael Wolf at Northwestern University to develop Asthma Self Management Enabling (ASME) Materials that target education and empowerment messages to inner-city adults with asthma or caregivers to affected children to 'prime' these individuals to maximize their benefit from asthma self-management programs. The ASME materials will include a multimedia program and ""enhanced print"" handout; both designed to be accessible to a lower literate audience and be culturally appropriate. Training and research activities will be nested in an ongoing study led by the Primary Sponsor of this proposal (K. Weiss), and will include: 1) analyses of longitudinal data to better understand direct and indirect pathways through which literacy and cultural influences impact asthma self-management behaviors, 2) Use findings from those analyses to guide qualitative research activities for the development, refinement, and pilot testing of the ASME materials, and 3) field test the ASME materials among adults with asthma and caregivers to children with asthma, to see if the materials improve coping, knowledge, and self-efficacy. Findings from this research will support grant submissions for a more substantial evaluation of the materials; I will also explore opportunities to translate this methodology to the self-management of other chronic diseases.

"Asthma Surveillance and Education in Preschool Settings DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a non-randomized, controlled, prospective trial to test the efficacy of a bilingual intervention to improve asthma care for low-income inner-city children enrolled in subsidized preschool childcare programs. Because of high rates of asthma prevalence, subsidized preschool childcare programs offer ideal settings to test innovative strategies to improve asthma care within communities at highest risk of morbidity. There are three intervention arms to this study. Surveillance - identifying the children that have diagnosed asthma and requiring written asthma action plans from their providers. Surveillance plus monitoring - adds a system to track parent compliance with the asthma action plan requirement. Surveillance plus monitoring plus education - adds individualized asthma education to promote adherence and a partnership between parent and doctor. This design aims to test whether a monthly monitoring system increases the proportion of parents who obtain written asthma action plans compared with parents in the surveillance only arm. It also aims to compare parents who receive individualized asthma education with parents in the surveillance and monitoring arm as to the proportion who are prescribed controller medications, who regularly administer controller medications to the child, and who report persistent asthma symptoms, Emergency Department visits and hospitalization for asthma. To test these aims, the three arms will be implemented in subsidized childcare programs in East Harlem, the Lower East Side and the South Bronx - 3 geographically separate New York City communities with high rates of asthma prevalence. A total of 191 parents of asthmatic children aged 2.8-4 years old will be recruited into the study. Interviews will be conducted at baseline, 4, 8 and 12-month follow-up. Because of the non-randomized design, additional intervention components will be phased in at program sites to verify that effects are due to intervention rather than community differences. Baseline measures of the three groups will be compared and multivariate models will be used to address key research hypotheses in this study. This study will provide data on efforts at the institutional and individual levels that can be directed to reducing asthma morbidity in populations most heavily impacted by the disease.

"Asthma Disparities in Cohorts at Risk for Morbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The goals of this Center are to determine the mechanisms underlying the disparities in asthma, and to improve asthma care in a targeted group at high risk for asthma-specific, maternal and perinatal complications, pregnant women with asthma. The proposed Meharry-Vanderbilt Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities entitled Asthma Disparities in Cohorts at Risk for Morbidity@ is a joint collaborative effort produced in the context of a formal alliance between the institutions, the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance. This Alliance commits the two institutions to learn from each other for the benefit of student education, patient care, and research progress. The Alliance has already established NIH funding, organized community outreach, and formalized institutional cross training. The proposed Center would be a natural extension of Alliance goals and methods. The training projects were developed jointly to optimize the unique values of the minority serving institution, Meharry Medical College, and the research intensive institution, Vanderbilt University. Funds are dedicated for summer research experiences for medical students and for pilot investigations relevant to asthma disparities. This proposal targets minority groups at risk of significant asthma-related morbidity: pregnant women, children requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and asthmatics requiring emergency care. A controlled randomized trial of the relative efficacy of two culturally sensitive asthma education and smoking cessation programs will target pregnant women with asthma of black or Hispanic race/ethnicity. Simultaneously, the same investigators will examine asthma-related morbidity in a large cohort of pregnant women utilizing administrative data and vital records. Perceptions of asthma severity and ways to describe it appear to differ in Blacks compared to whites. Therefore we will convene focus groups of patients and families attending the emergency room to validate a culturally sensitive instrument to allow improved descriptors of asthma severity for Blacks. Estimates by the patients of asthma severity will be matched to objective measures, and compared with those of whites. This methodology will then be used to extend the hypothesis to children admitted with severe asthma to the region=s only pediatric ICU. In the pediatric ICU, the admission rates and outcomes will be associated with the potentially important genetic variations in the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (BADR2). Using parents and non-affected siblings as case controls, a novel computational method will test for gene-gene interactions that explain a genetic basis for asthma disparities in severe asthma. These interrelated projects jointly conducted by investigators from each institution will illuminate the mechanisms responsible for asthma disparities and provide novel interventions in targeted minority groups at risk for morbidity from asthma.

"Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma and marked improvements in the therapies available to treat asthma, disadvantaged and minority communities still carry a disproportionate burden from asthma. The exact reasons for this phenomenon are unknown, however, a number of factors have been proposed to account for this disparity, including genetic differences in vulnerability to asthma or asthma severity, differential rates of environmental exposure (e.g. cockroaches, dust), differences in the accessibility and quality of asthma medical care for patients of differing socioeconomic status, and inadequate asthma self-management practices, including poor adherence with therapy. It is widely believed that these factors interact to cause the observed excess burden of asthma within low-income, minority populations. Howard University and Johns Hopkins University have a long and successful history of collaborative studies designed to evaluate asthma morbidity in low-income, African-American children and adults with asthma. This application draws on this rich history to propose the formal collaboration of these institutions and investigators as a part of the Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities. Specifically, this application presents four research projects designed to collaboratively investigate factors associated with the disproportionate burden of asthma experienced by inner-city, African-American children and adults. This application includes studies that will evaluate both the underlying genetic factors that may contribute to the observed excess risk in African-American communities, as well as studies of provider-patient communication designed to assess intervention strategies for remediating this risk. In addition, an essential goal of the Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities will be to create a culturally sensitive training environment that is truly reciprocal, and designed to both enrich and enhance the research potential and asthma management capabilities of both participating institutions.

"Determinants of Asthma Morbidity in an Urban Population DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Despite advances in asthma therapy, asthma morbidity has increased dramatically in the past decade, especially among inner-city minority populations. While epidemiological studies have highlighted the sociodemographic groups most at risk for illness and death, the underlying reasons for these disparities in health are not well understood. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the factors contributing to asthma morbidity in inner-city minority populations. The specific aims are to: (1) develop an instrument to measure patient adherence to asthma control medications; (2) determine the relative contribution of low adherence to medications, inadequate patient-provider communication, and poor access to care to poor asthma outcomes; (3) test if sensitization and indoor exposure to cockroach allergen result in increased asthma morbidity; and (4) develop the protocol and perform pilot testing of an intervention to improve the outcomes of adult inner-city asthmatics.      The proposed study will enroll 420 adults with persistent asthma from the Primary Care Clinic of the Mount Sinai Hospital, located in East Harlem, a community in the epicenter of the asthma epidemic. The protocol will include a comprehensive baseline interview followed by telephone questionnaires at 4- and 12-weeks. The domains covered by the baseline interview will include sociodemographics, co-morbidities, access to care, past utilization, current medications, adherence, knowledge, beliefs, psychological symptoms, quality of patient-provider communication, environmental exposure to indoor allergens, and metered dose inhaler technique. Allergen specific IgE antibodies will be used to document allergic sensitization. At 4 and 12 weeks following the baseline assessment, telephone interviews will be conducted to obtain data on asthma symptoms, quality of life, peak flow   measurements, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and unscheduled outpatient visits.   In the final 11/2 years of the project, the data collected from the initial phase of this proposal will be used to develop and pilot a self-management intervention to improve the outcome of inner-city asthmatics.   During the five-year project, the candidate will pursue advanced graduate work in clinical epidemiology and health services research to further develop his scientific skills.

"Determinants of asthma severity in Harlem (DASH) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent rise in asthma morbidity and mortality has impacted the African American population disproportionately. It is likely that in addition to environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility factors have contributed to this disparity. Little is known, however, about how specific genetic polymorphisms, including those on chromosome 5q, impact the pathogenesis of asthma. Though the prevalence of specific polymorphisms (allelic variants) is known to vary across populations (population stratification), genetic studies on asthma in African Americans have characteristically included small numbers, and inadequate controls. Moreover, there is almost no information about the immunological pathways that contribute to asthma severity in this population. Our study, DASH (Determinants of Asthma Severity in Harlem), seeks to establish the link between specific genotypic variants and phenotypic markers, and to elucidate immunological pathways that contribute to asthma severity in an African American population. DASH addresses the next step in reaching our long-range goal, i.e., to control asthma in the African American population of Harlem. We propose a case-control study of individuals of African American heritage, who live in Central and West Harlem. We will test our central hypothesis: Polymorphisms in candidate asthma genes on chromosome 5g modify disease severity in individuals who have asthma, and these polymorphisms and specific T cell response phenotypes differ between individuals who have asthma and those who do not. The research plan will address the following specific aims: (1) to define the phenotype and allelic variants of the IL-4, IL-13 and Beta2-adrenoreceptor genes among African American asthmatic individuals (cases) and controls; and (2) to define T cell response phenotypes among African Americans who have asthma. The DASH study represents the largest effort undertaken to date, to study the genetics of asthma in an African American population; and it seeks to elucidate important immunological mechanisms (T-cell responses) that contribute to asthma severity. Moreover, it enables the linkage of T-cell responses to specific allelic variants. Our approach is to apply modern technologies (haplotype analysis; immunophenotyping) toward development of a mechanism-based framework for understanding pathways that underlie asthma severity in the African American population. The data collected through the DASH study will elucidate the relevance of emerging directions for asthma management, including pharmacogenetic strategies, for this population. The potential public health benefits are critical for the asthmatic population in general.

"PEDIATRIC ASTHMA DISPARITIES: PERCEPTIONS AND MANAGEMENT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Pediatric asthma, the most common chronic illness of childhood, is increasing in prevalence, morbidity and mortality : particularly in minority children.  This application seeks to establish the Rhode Island : Puerto Rico Asthma Center (RIPRAC) for reducing disparities in asthma among Latino children.  Brown University faculty involved with an extensive pediatric asthma research program will join with epidemiologists, clinicians, and health services researchers from the minority serving University of Puerto Rico to study potentially overlooked determinants of disparity.  An ambitious training component (based on a successful T32 research training program) will involve individuals from both sites at both sites.  The RIPRAC Research AIMS include four projects that seek to understand the causes of disparities at multiple levels : the biomedical, the individual/family, and the socioenvironmental level.  The four projects, respectively, will 1) examine discrepancies between the diagnosis of asthma as assessed by parental report, the primary care medical record and our systematic diagnosis base on the NHLBI guidelines; 2) assess characteristics (prescription practices, shared decision making, continuity and access to care) of the health care system that may differentially affect asthma morbidity; 3) evaluate family beliefs, the burden of asthma management and medication adherence as they affect asthma morbidity and health care utilization in Latino and Anglo children; and 4) study the relation of symptom perception to pediatric asthma discrepancies.  Subjects for all 4 projects will be the same 300 mainland Anglos, 200 mainland Latinos (of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent) and 400 island Puerto Rico children with asthma, aged 7-15, thereby promoting comparability and efficiency.  Chi-square analyses and ANOVA's will be used to assess differences between groups; techniques of logistic regression and multiple regression will be used to model the effects of covariates.  The RIPRAC Training component will provide clinical research education and supervision to Puerto Rican trainees and faculty, enhance cultural awareness of Brown personnel as it relates to asthma disparities, and launch at least three trainee-led pilot research projects in the area.

"HOWARD/HOPKINS CENTER FOR REDUCING ASTHMA DISPARTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma and marked   improvements in the therapies available to treat asthma, disadvantaged and minority communities still carry a disproportionate burden from asthma. The exact reasons for this phenomenon are unknown, however, a number of factors have been proposed to account for this disparity, including genetic differences in vulnerability to asthma or asthma severity, differential rates of environmental exposure (e.g. cockroaches, dust), differences in the accessibility and quality of asthma medical care for patients of differing socioeconomic status, and inadequate asthma self-management practices, including poor adherence with therapy. It is widely believed that these factors interact to cause the observed excess burden of asthma within low-income, minority populations. Howard University and Johns Hopkins University have a long and successful history of collaborative studies designed to evaluate asthma morbidity in low-income, African-American children and adults with asthma. This application draws on this rich history to propose the formal collaboration of these institutions and investigators as a part of the Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities. Specifically, this application presents four research projects designed to collaboratively investigate factors associated with the disproportionate burden of asthma experienced by inner-city, African-American children and adults. This application includes studies that will evaluate both the underlying genetic factors that may contribute to the observed excess risk in African-American communities, as well as studies of provider-patient communication designed to assess intervention strategies for remediating this risk. In addition, an essential goal of the Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities will be to create a culturally sensitive training environment that is truly reciprocal, and designed to both enrich and enhance the research potential and asthma management capabilities of both participating institutions.

"Asthma Disparities in Cohorts at Risk for Morbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The goals of this Center are to determine the mechanisms underlying the disparities in asthma, and to improve asthma care in a targeted group at high risk for asthma-specific, maternal and perinatal complications, pregnant women with asthma. The proposed Meharry-Vanderbilt Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities entitled Asthma Disparities in Cohorts at Risk for Morbidity@ is a joint collaborative effort produced in the context of a formal alliance between the institutions, the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance. This Alliance commits the two institutions to learn from each other for the benefit of student education, patient care, and research progress. The Alliance has already established NIH funding, organized community outreach, and formalized institutional cross training. The proposed Center would be a natural extension of Alliance goals and methods. The training projects were developed jointly to optimize the unique values of the minority serving institution, Meharry Medical College, and the research intensive institution, Vanderbilt University. Funds are dedicated for summer research experiences for medical students and for pilot investigations relevant to asthma disparities. This proposal targets minority groups at risk of significant asthma-related morbidity: pregnant women, children requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and asthmatics requiring emergency care. A controlled randomized trial of the relative efficacy of two culturally sensitive asthma education and smoking cessation programs will target pregnant women with asthma of black or Hispanic race/ethnicity. Simultaneously, the same investigators will examine asthma-related morbidity in a large cohort of pregnant women utilizing administrative data and vital records. Perceptions of asthma severity and ways to describe it appear to differ in Blacks compared to whites. Therefore we will convene focus groups of patients and families attending the emergency room to validate a culturally sensitive instrument to allow improved descriptors of asthma severity for Blacks. Estimates by the patients of asthma severity will be matched to objective measures, and compared with those of whites. This methodology will then be used to extend the hypothesis to children admitted with severe asthma to the region=s only pediatric ICU. In the pediatric ICU, the admission rates and outcomes will be associated with the potentially important genetic variations in the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (BADR2). Using parents and non-affected siblings as case controls, a novel computational method will test for gene-gene interactions that explain a genetic basis for asthma disparities in severe asthma. These interrelated projects jointly conducted by investigators from each institution will illuminate the mechanisms responsible for asthma disparities and provide novel interventions in targeted minority groups at risk for morbidity from asthma.

"Adult Asthma: Biology, Society and Environment   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental, biological, and                  psychosocial factors can all separately influence the disease burden in asthma.      As yet, no studies have taken into account all three categories of factors           together, to examine their relative contributions to the disease burden and          investigate whether their cumulative effects can explain the health disparities      of at-risk populations, either additively or synergistically. Asthma is an           ideal chronic condition in which to delineate the potential linkages among           biological mechanisms, social factors, and physical environments and, more           specifically, to show how these linkages may lead to health disparities. Study       Hypotheses: 1) There are socioeconomic status (SES) differentials in the             disease burden of asthma; 2) Environmental, biological, and psychosocial             factors are linked to the asthma disease burden additively, if not                   synergistically; and 3) The variance in SES differentials of disease burden          will be substantially explained by modeling that takes specific environmental,       biological, and psychosocial factors into account. Methods: This proposed study      will make use of an established panel of 590 adults with asthma of varying           severity. We propose to supplement these survey data with 500 home site visits       in which we will directly gather environmental, biological, and psychosocial         data. Specific environmental risk factors we will quantify include: allergen         sensitization, home allergens, ETS exposure, and indoor air quality. We will         also assess perceived stress and social support. In addition, we will link           subjects to other potential exposures through external data sets. We will also       administer a follow-up survey to investigate the combined influence of               environmental, biological, and psychosocial exposures in explaining SES              disparities in the disease burden of asthma. This study combines a                   multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in clinical medicine,           social sciences, epidemiology, psychology, endocrinology, asthma treatment and       prevention, and biostatistics. Anticipated Results and Significance: The             proposed investigation will have sufficient power to detect differences in the       proportions of outcomes between two groups in the range of 10-15 percent at the      0.05 level for dichotomous outcomes.

"COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP TO REDUCE ASTHMA DISPARITIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric asthma is increasingly common among minority children, and results in considerable healthcare disparity. This application seeks to establish a Community Partnership between Rhode Island Hospital and the Providence Community Health Centers to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to increase use of controller medications for asthma among Latino and African-American children. A Community Advisory Board of parents and key informants will provide ongoing input regarding treatment implementation. Families with children who have persistent asthma symptoms will be enrolled. Three groups will be recruited (N=240 total): African-American families, Latino families who prefer health care in Spanish, and Latino families who prefer health care in English. All families will be enrolled in a brief baseline period. Children who are prescribed oral or inhaled controller medications will have medication use monitored electronically. Research staff will also collect data regarding baseline medication use from pharmacy records and insurance claims. Asthma knowledge, medication beliefs, medication adherence, and asthma morbidity will be assessed at baseline, end of treatment, and at 3-month intervals until 1 year post-treatment. After completing a baseline, all families will attend a group-based asthma education class in their own Community Health Center (one of five CHC's). Families will the be randomized to one of two nurse delivered interventions, either 1) a Standard Care (SC) condition, which emphasizes use of symptom monitoring, peak flow meter, trigger control measures, and a written action plan, or 2) a Medication Adherence (MA) condition, which assesses use of alternative medications, addresses concerns regarding use of controller medications, and uses problem-solving techniques to address barriers to medication use. Follow-up is conducted by researcher assistants at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month time points post-intervention. It is expected that both interventions will increase asthma knowledge, but the MA intervention will yield greater controller medication use and decreased morbidity. It is further expected that differences in medication adherence post-treatment will be mediated by medication beliefs. Lastly, it is anticipated that within the Latino groups, Latinos with low English proficiency will demonstrate the greatest changes from baseline on medication adherence and morbidity. A Sustainability Advisory board will provide guidance regarding project implementation in the community beyond the life of the grant.               ",COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP TO REDUCE ASTHMA DISPARITIES,6873873,R01NR008524,"['clinical trial ', ' inhalation drug administration ', ' health education ', ' family structure /dynamics ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' health care quality ', ' community health service ', ' patient care management ', ' health care service availability ', ' health economics ', ' human subject ', ' asthma ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' health behavior ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' culture ', ' therapy compliance ', ' oral administration ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' respiratory disease /disorder therapy ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NINR,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2005,413341,0.17557440466620072

"Protective Factors in Urban Children with Asthma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric asthma is over-represented in children from low income, urban, and ethnic minority backgrounds in the U.S. The NIH is actively promoting research that identifies factors that decrease the health disparities between ethnic minority, low-income children and their healthier, white counterparts. The combined risks related to having asthma and facing social stressors (poverty, acculturative stress) may increase functional impairment (e.g., increased emergency visits). However, there are urban children and families who are managing asthma effectively, despite facing such risks.       The primary objectives of this project are to identify child-specific, cultural, and disease-specific protective processes that minimize asthma morbidity despite exposure to adversity in urban, low-income children. Indices of asthma morbidity to be examined at baseline (initial visit) and follow-up (one year later) include: the number of asthma-related emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and degree of functional limitation. A risk and resilience theoretical model will be applied to this study. A Cumulative Risk Index (CRI) will provide a score that indicates the number and severity of several urban risks that families may face. Participants will include low-income and urban, 8-11 year old children from African-American, Latino, and Anglo backgrounds (N= 150, 50 families in each ethnic group). Children with asthma and their primary caregivers will participate in a home observation and interview-based assessments on risk, protective processes, and morbidity. Three months after the baseline interview, families will participate in a longitudinal, follow-up component (for one year). Four phone interviews that occur three months apart will collect information on morbidity.       It is proposed that higher levels of child, cultural, and asthma-specific factors will moderate the relation between the cumulative level of risks and minimal asthma morbidity for urban children at baseline and follow-up. Higher levels of child-specific and asthma-specific factors will minimize morbidity for African- American, Hispanic, and Anglo children. Cultural factors (family values and beliefs) related to minimal morbidity will differ by ethnic subgroup. Results will be used to design a culturally sensitive asthma intervention to enhance asthma management behaviors of ethnic minority, urban and poor families.

"Airway Disease and Cockroach Exposure in Public Housing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma morbidity and mortality in poor, urban populations is unacceptably high.  We and others have proposed that allergic sensitization to cockroaches may contribute to this problem.  New analysis of our previously completed study of asthmatic adolescents shows even stronger association between indices of asthma severity and cockroach allergy.  However, further in-depth assessment is required for the development of environmental policies and urban housing planning that address cockroach infestation in the context of respiratory health.  The current grant was designed to provide additional evidence supporting the causal relationship between asthma morbidity and cockroach allergy/exposure.  In the first period of this project, the data we have generated through a complete survey of the Claremont public housing complex in Baltimore City indicate that the prevalence of asthma in this population is much higher than the national average.  In addition, we find that 60% of asthmatics in this population are sensitized to cockroaches.  We continue our strong collaboration with the Housing Authority of Baltimore City and we are in the process of beginning our work in the O'Donnell Heights complex.  This development is scheduled for demolition by the end of 2005, with new units available in 2007.  We request renewal of this grant with the following aims. In Aim 1, we will survey the entire O'Donnell population so that we have full asthma prevalence data of a representative sample of public housing residents.  Survey results will be validated with determination of airways responsiveness.  Within the O'Donnell population, we will perform a cross-sectional study in individuals with asthma evaluating risk factors for asthma morbidity with focus on cockroach and other allergen exposure, endotoxin exposure, exposure to indoor air pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10) and obesity.  To ascertain the relationship between the above risk factors and the presence of asthma, we will perform a case-control study involving the O'Donnell residents with asthma vs. a group of residents with lone rhinitis and a healthy group.  In Aim 2, we will monitor asthma morbidity longitudinally in all asthmatic residents of O'Donnell Heights, while they are relocated into new homes.  It is our hypothesis that those with cockroach allergy who will be relocated to cockroach-free environment will experience improvement in airway disease.  Aim 3, consists of a randomized, parallel study utilizing individuals relocating into the new units that are replacing the Claremont complex.  This study will test the effectiveness of an education/behavioral modification program, combined with precision-targeted early mitigation, against no intervention, in avoiding cockroach infestation of new homes. We hope that with the data to be generated, we will positively impact the health of urban US populations who are disproportionally suffering from asthma morbidity and mortality.

This application seeks to establish the Rhode Island -Puerto Rico Asthma Center (RIPRAC) for reducing disparities in asthma among Latino children. Brown University faculty involved with an extensive pediatric asthma research program will join with epidemiologists, clinicians, and health services researchers from the minority serving University of Puerto Rico to study potentially overlooked determinants of disparity. An ambitious training component (based on a successful T32 research training program) will involve individuals from both sites at both sites.      The RIPRAC Research AIMS include four projects that seek to understand the causes of disparities at multiple levels - the biomedical, the individual/family, and the socioenvironmental level. The four projects, respectively, will 1) examine discrepancies between the diagnosis of asthma as assessed by parental report, the primary care medical record and our systematic diagnosis base on the NHLBI guidelines; 2) assess characteristics (prescription practices, shared decision making, continuity and access to care) of the health care system that may differentially affect asthma morbidity; 3) evaluate family beliefs, the burden of asthma management and medication adherence as they affect asthma morbidity and health care utilization in Latino and Anglo children; and 4) study the relation of symptom perception to pediatric asthma discrepancies. Subjects for all 4 projects will be the same 300 mainland Anglos, 200 mainland Latinos (of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent) and 400 island Puerto Rico children with asthma, aged 7-15, thereby promoting comparability and efficiency. Chi-square analyses and ANOVA's will be used to assess differences between groups; techniques of logistic regression and multiple regression will be used to model the effects of covariates. The RIPRAC Training component will provide clinical research education and supervision to Puerto Rican trainees and faculty, enhance cultural awareness of Brown personnel as it relates to asthma disparities, and launch at least three trainee-led pilot research projects in the area.

"Social Support and Education in Asthma Follow-Up    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our previous NHLBI-supported study (HL 57232) showed that a combination treatment of ""Coaching"" through follow-up phone calls 2 and 5 days following an index ED visit plus monetary incentive was highly effective in increasing the percentage of low-income urban children who received recommended primary care within 2 weeks of the ED visit for asthma, 44% in the intervention group vs 29% in usual care (p = 0.0004). However, the intervention was not associated with significant differences in morbidity (subsequent ED visits). We conclude that the intervention was effective in promoting the initial link to primary care, but was not effective in sustaining that link or management practices to minimize acuity of symptoms during exacerbation. Here we propose an expansion of the intervention initiated at the time of an ED visit for asthma to promote ongoing primary care and effective asthma management. Parents of low-income, urban, predominantly African American children, aged 2 - 12 years will be recruited at the time of their children's ED visits for acute wheezing. The experimental Intervention is designed to reduce morbidity from recurrent asthma through ongoing education and social support to encourage long-term primary care and adherence to recommended asthma management practices. It will include: 1) as in our previous study, monetary incentive to visit the PCP in order to start the process of ongoing care; 2) as in our previous study, contact by an asthma ""Coach,"" but now extended through 12 months following the ED visit and focusing not only on attending primary care as recommended but also on parent adherence to asthma management strategies developed with the primary care provider (PCP); and 3) telemedicine provided by asthma nurses to reinforce asthma management strategies and assess the status of the child's asthma continued through 6 months following the index ED visit. After informed consent, cases will be randomly assigned to either Usual Care or Intervention, stratified by PCP clinic. All children will receive standardized/usual ED care to resolve wheezing and standardized discharge advice. Follow-up to assess study outcomes will be scheduled every 6 months from the time of randomization of each case and continue for 24 months following randomization. Intended impacts on patterns of care will be assessed by proportions of children who have a visit to their PCP for asthma planning within 2 weeks after the index ED visit and [3]1 subsequent PCP visit for regular care that includes asthma planning during the 24 months of follow-up. Primary outcome will be asthma morbidity, as indexed by the proportion of children who have at least one ED visit during the 24-month follow-up period. Additional outcomes will include the proportion of children who have at least 1 hospitalization, the proportion of participants with [3]1 visit to the PCP for acute asthma, and the net cost of asthma-related care, all through the 24 months of intervention and follow-up. Planned enrolment is 248 subjects (124 per group) to provide 80% power at p = .05 to detect a reduction of ED visits of 20%. Because the primary outcome can be obtained from medical records after consent even if phone contact cannot be maintained, intent to treat model will be used for analyses.

"Motivating Asthma Adherence in Urban Teens Low-income, minority teenagers have disproportionately high rates of asthma morbidity, including excess risk of emergency department (ED) care, hospitalization and death from asthma, compared to white adolescents. Research by this group and others has documented that non-adherence with asthma treatment regimens is common among high-risk, inner city families with asthma, and that this poor adherence with prescribed therapies plays a significant contributing role in asthma morbidity. Inner-city adolescents with asthma are at particular risk of non-adherence, yet this population remains understudied. While asthma self-management training has shown promise in achieving some improvement in adherence with asthma, there are few intervention studies explicitly targeting adolescents, particularly those in the inner-city. Urban children typically assume primary control over their asthma management during late childhood/early adolescence. At the same time, adolescents' efforts to achieve autonomy and peer-acceptance may result in increase health risk behaviors, including poor asthma self-management. Developmentally-appropriate asthma self-management interventions are needed that target the unique challenges of adolescence. Motivational Interviewing (Ml) is a promising interventional approach that uses a client-centered, nondirective approach for enhancing motivation to change health behaviors. Ml techniques are developmentally consistent with the needs of early adolescents. Ml does not assume that health will be the most important factor motivating the teen, but rather acknowledges and incorporates other motivators that are within the context of the teen's life, thus this intervention strategy has the flexibility to adapt to the unique life circumstances and stressors faced by urban adolescents. We propose to evaluate the relative effectiveness of a Mi-focused self-management intervention (MI+SM) compared to a self-management (SM) intervention containing asthma education and self-monitoring strategies in a sample of 226 children age 10-15 years treated for asthma in the ED. Our primary hypothesis is that the MI+SM, as compared to SM alone, will result in greater improvement in medication adherence at 3- and 6-months post-randomization, as measured by electronic medication monitoring. Secondary outcomes include self-reported medication adherence, symptoms free days, urgent health care utilization for asthma, and caregiver/adolescent quality of life.

"Preventive Asthma Care Utilization among Black Children Epidemiological data suggests increased morbidity, prevalence and mortality associated with asthma among African-American children. This population tends to over-utilize the emergency department for asthma care although preventive asthma care within the primary care setting is more optimal to control and manage asthma-associated morbidity. Previous studies have suggested that racial differences in the rates of preventive asthma care utilization can be attributed to several factors, including the disparity in health insurance coverage between racial groups, social, financial and system barriers to preventive asthma care, and divergent health care seeking beliefs among African-American women. For my dissertation research, I plan to investigate how ""race"" when defined explicitly as social class, culturally derived health beliefs, and exposure to structural forces such as racism mediates my outcome of interest, utilization of preventive asthma care.

"Web-based Asthma Education for Urban Head Start Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing asthma prevalence and hospitalization rates of preschool children (ages 3-5) signal a major public health problem that requires early intervention. Evidence of health disparities and unequal treatment among low-income, urban, minority preschoolers with asthma underscores the need to develop culturally sensitive asthma interventions in community-based programs, such as Head Start, that work with high risk preschool children and their families. All of the family caregivers and child care providers who work with preschoolers need to know how to prevent and manage asthma episodes, yet little is known about the informational needs of ethnic minority parents of preschoolers with asthma or child care providers in different settings. Because preschoolers must rely on caregivers in different settings to help them manage their asthma, an ecological approach to asthma management guides this study. Using a participatory action research methodology, the investigators will partner with parents who have preschoolers with asthma and are enrolled in Ramsey Action Program (RAP) Head Start programs in St. Paul, Minnesota and Head Start staff to develop an action plan to address parent- and staff-identified needs. The short-term goals of this pilot project are: 1) to determine the asthma information and resource needs of parents from ethnically diverse backgrounds and Head Start staff who care for preschoolers, and 2) to determine the feasibility of providing culturally sensitive, web-based asthma education to Head Start parents and staff by designing and evaluating a preliminary asthma information web site for Head Start based on identified needs. The long-term plan is to develop a multi-media, web-based asthma education program for parents and staff in urban and rural Head   Start programs in Minnesota.            ",Web-based Asthma Education for Urban Head Start Program,6890306,R03NR008752,"['adult human (21+) ', ' child care ', ' child care personnel ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' computer assisted instruction ', ' health education ', ' parent ', ' patient care management ', ' asthma ', ' ethnic group ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' community ', ' urban area ', ' culture ', ' Internet ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R03,2005,71996,0.42112177337419404
"Chicago Initiative to Raise Asthma Health Equity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Over the past decade there has been a heightened awareness of the disproportionate impact of asthma morbidity and mortality among African Americans and persons of lower social economic status. The causes underlying this disparity have not been fully elucidated. However, there is strong evidence that the level of social stress imposed by this condition and the degree of coping and self-management skills present are factors that may be particularly important in explaining these disparities. The purpose of this project is to develop a collaborative research program between Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Cook County Hospital to fully characterize the relationship of social stress, coping, and self-regulatory health behaviors in the context of asthma disparities among African American and low income populations. Once characterized, the project will then develop and test an intervention strategy to reduce asthma disparities in high-risk populations based on evidence-based models that have demonstrated success in social work, nursing, and community interventions. There are four research aims for this proposed Center of Excellence.      (1) To develop and validate culturally appropriate psychosocial instruments related to the underlying causes of disparity in asthma morbidity (2) To identify the structural relationships of psychosocial factors to other known influential factors related to disparities in asthma outcomes. (3) To study the changes in structural relationship among influential factors in asthma disparity over time as related to changes in health status. (4) To develop, pilot test, and field test a community-based asthma team (peer coach, asthma nurse, and social worker) intervention to enhance individuals ability to cope with chronic illness and improve asthma-related behaviors.

"EFFICACY OF WRITTEN TREATMENT PLANS IN ASTHMA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective self-management of asthma requires that patients or their caregivers recognize the early symptoms of an exacerbation and initiate appropriate interventions aimed at preventing the progression of symptoms. Most asthma clinical guidelines suggest that the incorporation of a written self-management plan is an essential tool that patients must possess, be able to understand, and follow if they are to respond appropriately to changes in asthma status. Nevertheless, there are no controlled trials examining the efficacy of the written plan itself. Furthermore, even if written plans are an essential and an effective component of successful self-management, the data suggest that few patients receive them. Barriers to the use of written plans need more study if patients and physicians are to increase their use of this tool. Additionally, studies are needed to examine the efficacy of written plans across different patient populations. The overall goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of a model, written treatment plan in a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) compared with the usual care that is provided by a group of adult and pediatric pulmonologists and allergists in their practice settings. The model plan is a form that allows a treatment regimen consistent with NHLBI guidelines to be conveyed to patients. An additional goal is to assess how patients from different racial/ethnic backgrounds utilize treatments plans. Specific aims: 1) to identify barriers to the use of written plans and determine whether these barriers differ across racial/ethnic groups; 2) to develop, validate, and pilot test a model written treatment plan form plus instructions to doctors for its use; and 3) to conduct a RCT of the model plan form with African-American, Latino, and non-Latino white patients to: a) assess the efficacy of the plan across patient populations and b) determine if using written plans reduce racial/ethnic disparities in asthma outcomes. We hypothesize that patients with asthma who receive the model written plan form will have, relative to patients in the control group, significantly greater improvement in 3 primary outcome measures: 1.1) reduction in asthma symptom frequency; 1.2) reduction in emergency use of health care services; and 1.3) improved quality of life. We will also examine 4 secondary outcome measures: 1.4) asthma hospitalizations; 1.5) days with activity restriction; 1.6) the proportion of patients in the intervention group who receive the plan during the initial visit; and 1.7) use of the plans by patients.         ",EFFICACY OF WRITTEN TREATMENT PLANS IN ASTHMA,6929779,R01HL073955,"['patient care management ', ' patient care planning ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care personnel performance ', ' human subject ', ' asthma ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,740331,0.31828880405636656
"Genetics of Asthma In Latino Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma prevalence, morbidity and mortality are higher among Latino Americans on the east coast than on the west coast of the U.S. This is in stark contrast to the near geographic uniformity of asthma morbidity and mortality rates among African Americans and Caucasians in the U.S. The differences in asthma prevalence and severity among Latino Americans on the two coasts may reflect differences in the genetic contributions of Ancestral Native American, Spanish and African populations to the Latino population on the east coast (predominantly Puerto Rican) and west coast (predominantly Mexican). To determine whether identifiable genetic factors are associated with asthma and severe asthma among Mexican Americans, the largest U.S. Hispanic group, we will recruit Mexican American asthmatic subjects (probands) and their biologic parents (n=600) from California during a 1 year period. Probands will undergo formal phenotypic characterization. We will assemble a repository of DNA and plasma from the probands and their parents. We will identify novel single nucleotide plymorphisms (SNPs) among candidate genes at loci where there is evidence to suggest linkage to asthma in previous studies of other populations. We will determine whether novel SNPs and SNPs known to be associated with asthma in other populations are associated with asthma in Mexican Americans. We will compare the results generated from this repository to similar ongoing studies in Puerto Rican asthmatic families. The creation of a repository of DNA from well-characterized Mexican American asthmatics will enable future analysis of other genes identified in other studies. The results of this work may have important implications for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of asthma not only in Mexican Americans, but in other populations as well. The proposed research project is one component of a career development plan designed to prepare the applicant to lead an independent program applying novel advances in genomics to improving the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in medically underserved populations.

"Enhancing Prevention for Children in Diverse Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background and Candidate. Understanding and eliminating disparities in health is a national priority.  Black and Latino children bear a disproportionate burden of asthma, a leading cause of childhood morbidity.  Yet, minority children are less likely to be using appropriate preventive medications than white children.  This application requests a mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research (K24) for Dr. Tracy Lieu, MD, MPH, a nationally recognized pediatric health services researcher. Dr. Lieu has recently become Director of the new Center for Child Health Care Studies in her department at Harvard. Her goal is to enhance the adoption of effective preventive health interventions for children, especially minority children.  Her record demonstrates high productivity in funded research in asthma and vaccines.  Mentoring Plan. Dr. Lieu has a growing track record of mentoring and excellent opportunities to work with beginning investigators. She is responsible for three of the junior faculty in her new Center, all of whom are within their first three years. She is also the Children's Hospital Site Director of the Harvard Pediatric Health Services Research Fellowship Program. This K24 award is needed to protect Dr. Lieu's time for guiding these beginning investigators as they establish their research portfolios.      Research Plan. The proposed research in this K24 award builds on Dr. Lieu's ongoing NICHD-supported R01 on racial/ethnic disparities in medication use by children with persistent asthma. The aims are to:   1. Conduct a prospective cohort study to evaluate parent-provider communication patterns and health beliefs as predictors of preventive medication adoption and influenza vaccination among black, Latino, and white children with persistent asthma; and   2. Analyze existing data to identify practice site policies as well as clinician and patient-level predictors of preventive medication adoption among a diverse group of children with persistent asthma.      Summary. This application offers a combination of a highly successful researcher in an intellectually rich environment.

"Asthma Surveillance and Education in Preschool Settings DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a non-randomized, controlled, prospective trial to test the efficacy of a bilingual intervention to improve asthma care for low-income inner-city children enrolled in subsidized preschool childcare programs. Because of high rates of asthma prevalence, subsidized preschool childcare programs offer ideal settings to test innovative strategies to improve asthma care within communities at highest risk of morbidity. There are three intervention arms to this study. Surveillance - identifying the children that have diagnosed asthma and requiring written asthma action plans from their providers. Surveillance plus monitoring - adds a system to track parent compliance with the asthma action plan requirement. Surveillance plus monitoring plus education - adds individualized asthma education to promote adherence and a partnership between parent and doctor. This design aims to test whether a monthly monitoring system increases the proportion of parents who obtain written asthma action plans compared with parents in the surveillance only arm. It also aims to compare parents who receive individualized asthma education with parents in the surveillance and monitoring arm as to the proportion who are prescribed controller medications, who regularly administer controller medications to the child, and who report persistent asthma symptoms, Emergency Department visits and hospitalization for asthma. To test these aims, the three arms will be implemented in subsidized childcare programs in East Harlem, the Lower East Side and the South Bronx - 3 geographically separate New York City communities with high rates of asthma prevalence. A total of 191 parents of asthmatic children aged 2.8-4 years old will be recruited into the study. Interviews will be conducted at baseline, 4, 8 and 12-month follow-up. Because of the non-randomized design, additional intervention components will be phased in at program sites to verify that effects are due to intervention rather than community differences. Baseline measures of the three groups will be compared and multivariate models will be used to address key research hypotheses in this study.

Baseline measures of the three groups will be compared and multivariate models will be used to address key research hypotheses in this study. This study will provide data on efforts at the institutional and individual levels that can be directed to reducing asthma morbidity in populations most heavily impacted by the disease.

"Asthma Disparities: Advancing Multilevel Causal Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Fifteen million Americans suffer from asthma, and the burden of morbidity appears to be rising. Asthma is also a major cause of health disparities among minority and low socio-economic groups. Yet the increasing prevalence and marked disparities in asthma remain largely unexplained by known risk factors, suggesting the potential role of community-level factors.  The aim of this application is to enable the candidate to undertake training and mentored research to address the question: what is the role of community and neighborhood-level processes in explaining the occurrence and distribution of asthma?     The candidate has expertise in multilevel statistical modeling with substantive interest in the social determinants of health. Over the next five years, the candidate will gain training in: (1) asthma epidemiology and pathophysiology, (2) the theory and measurement of neighborhood-level processes, and (3) causal inference within a multilevel framework.  Applying a multilevel approach that explicitly recognizes the embedding of asthma within its biologic, socioeconomic, environmental, and community contexts, the candidate will conduct mentored research to examine the causes of asthma disparities at different stages in the life-course.  The proposed analysis will be carried out within three ongoing studies (Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress; Boston Area Community Health Study; and Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods) in two American cities (Boston and Chicago). The research will examine the potential roles of neighborhood attributes such as structural disadvantage, collective psychosocial characteristics and physical environmental conditions in explaining the known disparities in the prevalence of asthma.  The proposed award will be used to develop an integrative and transdisciplinary approach to these issues, drawing on the rich resources available within Harvard University, including access to community-based study populations as well as to expertise from multiple fields.

"HOWARD/HOPKINS CENTER FOR REDUCING ASTHMA DISPARTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma and marked   improvements in the therapies available to treat asthma, disadvantaged and minority communities still carry a disproportionate burden from asthma. The exact reasons for this phenomenon are unknown, however, a number of factors have been proposed to account for this disparity, including genetic differences in vulnerability to asthma or asthma severity, differential rates of environmental exposure (e.g. cockroaches, dust), differences in the accessibility and quality of asthma medical care for patients of differing socioeconomic status, and inadequate asthma self-management practices, including poor adherence with therapy. It is widely believed that these factors interact to cause the observed excess burden of asthma within low-income, minority populations. Howard University and Johns Hopkins University have a long and successful history of collaborative studies designed to evaluate asthma morbidity in low-income, African-American children and adults with asthma.

"Determinants of Asthma Morbidity in an Urban Population DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Despite advances in asthma therapy, asthma morbidity has increased dramatically in the past decade, especially among inner-city minority populations. While epidemiological studies have highlighted the sociodemographic groups most at risk for illness and death, the underlying reasons for these disparities in health are not well understood. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the factors contributing to asthma morbidity in inner-city minority populations. The specific aims are to: (1) develop an instrument to measure patient adherence to asthma control medications; (2) determine the relative contribution of low adherence to medications, inadequate patient-provider communication, and poor access to care to poor asthma outcomes; (3) test if sensitization and indoor exposure to cockroach allergen result in increased asthma morbidity; and (4) develop the protocol and perform pilot testing of an intervention to improve the outcomes of adult inner-city asthmatics.      The proposed study will enroll 420 adults with persistent asthma from the Primary Care Clinic of the Mount Sinai Hospital, located in East Harlem, a community in the epicenter of the asthma epidemic. The protocol will include a comprehensive baseline interview followed by telephone questionnaires at 4- and 12-weeks. The domains covered by the baseline interview will include sociodemographics, co-morbidities, access to care, past utilization, current medications, adherence, knowledge, beliefs, psychological symptoms, quality of patient-provider communication, environmental exposure to indoor allergens, and metered dose inhaler technique. Allergen specific IgE antibodies will be used to document allergic sensitization. At 4 and 12 weeks following the baseline assessment, telephone interviews will be conducted to obtain data on asthma symptoms, quality of life, peak flow   measurements, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and unscheduled outpatient visits.   In the final 11/2 years of the project, the data collected from the initial phase of this proposal will be used to develop and pilot a self-management intervention to improve the outcome of inner-city asthmatics.

"National Asthma Disparities Conference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): U.S. asthma morbidity and mortality disproportionately affects minority communities. African Americans are more likely to visit an ED or be hospitalized for asthma. Furthermore, asthma mortality is twice more likely among African Americans and Hispanics than Whites. Reducing the asthma health disparities is a goal of Healthy People 2010. In the last decade a number of efforts have taken place around the country to address this problem. The overall objective of this conference grant is to develop a parsimonious set of recommendations that can serve as ""next steps,"" for the research, clinical, policy, and consumer communities to use in reducing asthma disparities. To achieve this objective we plan the following specific aims: 1) To conduct a 2-day national conference to identify critical and practical 'next steps' to take in reducing asthma health disparities. In order to achieve this goal we plan on assembling a multi-disciplinary group of national experts in the fields of clinical research, clinical practice implementation, health care administration, minority health, health services research, public health practice, health care financing, health policy, and of course consumer advocacy. In the format of a two-day conference this group of experts will seek to review key issues underlying asthma health disparities, consider current research, clinical care, and policy that are seeking to address this problem, and then develop a practical set of recommendations for reducing these disparities through new research opportunities, proposed new directions in clinical and public policy, and innovative consumer strategies to promote change. 2) To develop from the conference a set of core dissemination tools that will provide the source for communicating conference recommendations to key audiences. 3) To conduct a targeted set of highly leveraged post-conference dissemination activities to communication the conference recommendations to key audiences.

"Motivating Asthma Adherence in Urban Teens Low-income, minority teenagers have disproportionately high rates of asthma morbidity, including excess risk of emergency department (ED) care, hospitalization and death from asthma, compared to white adolescents. Research by this group and others has documented that non-adherence with asthma treatment regimens is common among high-risk, inner city families with asthma, and that this poor adherence with prescribed therapies plays a significant contributing role in asthma morbidity. Inner-city adolescents with asthma are at particular risk of non-adherence, yet this population remains understudied. While asthma self-management training has shown promise in achieving some improvement in adherence with asthma, there are few intervention studies explicitly targeting adolescents, particularly those in the inner-city. Urban children typically assume primary control over their asthma management during late childhood/early adolescence. At the same time, adolescents' efforts to achieve autonomy and peer-acceptance may result in increase health risk behaviors, including poor asthma self-management. Developmentally-appropriate asthma self-management interventions are needed that target the unique challenges of adolescence. Motivational Interviewing (Ml) is a promising interventional approach that uses a client-centered, nondirective approach for enhancing motivation to change health behaviors. Ml techniques are developmentally consistent with the needs of early adolescents. Ml does not assume that health will be the most important factor motivating the teen, but rather acknowledges and incorporates other motivators that are within the context of the teen's life, thus this intervention strategy has the flexibility to adapt to the unique life circumstances and stressors faced by urban adolescents. We propose to evaluate the relative effectiveness of a Mi-focused self-management intervention (MI+SM) compared to a self-management (SM) intervention containing asthma education and self-monitoring strategies in a sample of 226 children age 10-15 years treated for asthma in the ED. Our primary hypothesis is that the MI+SM, as compared to SM alone, will result in greater improvement in medication adherence at 3- and 6-months post-randomization, as measured by electronic medication monitoring. Secondary outcomes include self-reported medication adherence, symptoms free days, urgent health care utilization for asthma, and caregiver/adolescent quality of life.

"Protective Factors in Urban Children with Asthma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric asthma is over-represented in children from low income, urban, and ethnic minority backgrounds in the U.S. The NIH is actively promoting research that identifies factors that decrease the health disparities between ethnic minority, low-income children and their healthier, white counterparts. The combined risks related to having asthma and facing social stressors (poverty, acculturative stress) may increase functional impairment (e.g., increased emergency visits). However, there are urban children and families who are managing asthma effectively, despite facing such risks.       The primary objectives of this project are to identify child-specific, cultural, and disease-specific protective processes that minimize asthma morbidity despite exposure to adversity in urban, low-income children. Indices of asthma morbidity to be examined at baseline (initial visit) and follow-up (one year later) include: the number of asthma-related emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and degree of functional limitation. A risk and resilience theoretical model will be applied to this study. A Cumulative Risk Index (CRI) will provide a score that indicates the number and severity of several urban risks that families may face. Participants will include low-income and urban, 8-11 year old children from African-American, Latino, and Anglo backgrounds (N= 150, 50 families in each ethnic group). Children with asthma and their primary caregivers will participate in a home observation and interview-based assessments on risk, protective processes, and morbidity. Three months after the baseline interview, families will participate in a longitudinal, follow-up component (for one year). Four phone interviews that occur three months apart will collect information on morbidity.       It is proposed that higher levels of child, cultural, and asthma-specific factors will moderate the relation between the cumulative level of risks and minimal asthma morbidity for urban children at baseline and follow-up. Higher levels of child-specific and asthma-specific factors will minimize morbidity for African- American, Hispanic, and Anglo children. Cultural factors (family values and beliefs) related to minimal morbidity will differ by ethnic subgroup. Results will be used to design a culturally sensitive asthma intervention to enhance asthma management behaviors of ethnic minority, urban and poor families.

"Airway Disease and Cockroach Exposure in Public Housing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma morbidity and mortality in poor, urban populations is unacceptably high.  We and others have proposed that allergic sensitization to cockroaches may contribute to this problem.  New analysis of our previously completed study of asthmatic adolescents shows even stronger association between indices of asthma severity and cockroach allergy.  However, further in-depth assessment is required for the development of environmental policies and urban housing planning that address cockroach infestation in the context of respiratory health.  The current grant was designed to provide additional evidence supporting the causal relationship between asthma morbidity and cockroach allergy/exposure.  In the first period of this project, the data we have generated through a complete survey of the Claremont public housing complex in Baltimore City indicate that the prevalence of asthma in this population is much higher than the national average.  In addition, we find that 60% of asthmatics in this population are sensitized to cockroaches.  We continue our strong collaboration with the Housing Authority of Baltimore City and we are in the process of beginning our work in the O'Donnell Heights complex.  This development is scheduled for demolition by the end of 2005, with new units available in 2007.  We request renewal of this grant with the following aims. In Aim 1, we will survey the entire O'Donnell population so that we have full asthma prevalence data of a representative sample of public housing residents.  Survey results will be validated with determination of airways responsiveness.  Within the O'Donnell population, we will perform a cross-sectional study in individuals with asthma evaluating risk factors for asthma morbidity with focus on cockroach and other allergen exposure, endotoxin exposure, exposure to indoor air pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10) and obesity.  To ascertain the relationship between the above risk factors and the presence of asthma, we will perform a case-control study involving the O'Donnell residents with asthma vs. a group of residents with lone rhinitis and a healthy group.  In Aim 2, we will monitor asthma morbidity longitudinally in all asthmatic residents of O'Donnell Heights, while they are relocated into new homes.  It is our hypothesis that those with cockroach allergy who will be relocated to cockroach-free environment will experience improvement in airway disease.  Aim 3, consists of a randomized, parallel study utilizing individuals relocating into the new units that are replacing the Claremont complex.  This study will test the effectiveness of an education/behavioral modification program, combined with precision-targeted early mitigation, against no intervention, in avoiding cockroach infestation of new homes. We hope that with the data to be generated, we will positively impact the health of urban US populations who are disproportionally suffering from asthma morbidity and mortality.

"Enhancing Prevention for Children in Diverse Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background and Candidate. Understanding and eliminating disparities in health is a national priority.  Black and Latino children bear a disproportionate burden of asthma, a leading cause of childhood morbidity.  Yet, minority children are less likely to be using appropriate preventive medications than white children.  This application requests a mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research (K24) for Dr. Tracy Lieu, MD, MPH, a nationally recognized pediatric health services researcher. Dr. Lieu has recently become Director of the new Center for Child Health Care Studies in her department at Harvard. Her goal is to enhance the adoption of effective preventive health interventions for children, especially minority children.  Her record demonstrates high productivity in funded research in asthma and vaccines.  Mentoring Plan. Dr. Lieu has a growing track record of mentoring and excellent opportunities to work with beginning investigators. She is responsible for three of the junior faculty in her new Center, all of whom are within their first three years. She is also the Children's Hospital Site Director of the Harvard Pediatric Health Services Research Fellowship Program. This K24 award is needed to protect Dr. Lieu's time for guiding these beginning investigators as they establish their research portfolios.      Research Plan. The proposed research in this K24 award builds on Dr. Lieu's ongoing NICHD-supported R01 on racial/ethnic disparities in medication use by children with persistent asthma. The aims are to:   1. Conduct a prospective cohort study to evaluate parent-provider communication patterns and health beliefs as predictors of preventive medication adoption and influenza vaccination among black, Latino, and white children with persistent asthma; and   2. Analyze existing data to identify practice site policies as well as clinician and patient-level predictors of preventive medication adoption among a diverse group of children with persistent asthma.      Summary.

"Asthma Disparities in Cohorts at Risk for Morbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The goals of this Center are to determine the mechanisms underlying the disparities in asthma, and to improve asthma care in a targeted group at high risk for asthma-specific, maternal and perinatal complications, pregnant women with asthma. The proposed Meharry-Vanderbilt Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities entitled Asthma Disparities in Cohorts at Risk for Morbidity@ is a joint collaborative effort produced in the context of a formal alliance between the institutions, the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance. This Alliance commits the two institutions to learn from each other for the benefit of student education, patient care, and research progress. The Alliance has already established NIH funding, organized community outreach, and formalized institutional cross training. The proposed Center would be a natural extension of Alliance goals and methods. The training projects were developed jointly to optimize the unique values of the minority serving institution, Meharry Medical College, and the research intensive institution, Vanderbilt University. Funds are dedicated for summer research experiences for medical students and for pilot investigations relevant to asthma disparities. This proposal targets minority groups at risk of significant asthma-related morbidity: pregnant women, children requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and asthmatics requiring emergency care. A controlled randomized trial of the relative efficacy of two culturally sensitive asthma education and smoking cessation programs will target pregnant women with asthma of black or Hispanic race/ethnicity. Simultaneously, the same investigators will examine asthma-related morbidity in a large cohort of pregnant women utilizing administrative data and vital records. Perceptions of asthma severity and ways to describe it appear to differ in Blacks compared to whites. Therefore we will convene focus groups of patients and families attending the emergency room to validate a culturally sensitive instrument to allow improved descriptors of asthma severity for Blacks. Estimates by the patients of asthma severity will be matched to objective measures, and compared with those of whites. This methodology will then be used to extend the hypothesis to children admitted with severe asthma to the region=s only pediatric ICU. In the pediatric ICU, the admission rates and outcomes will be associated with the potentially important genetic variations in the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (BADR2). Using parents and non-affected siblings as case controls, a novel computational method will test for gene-gene interactions that explain a genetic basis for asthma disparities in severe asthma. These interrelated projects jointly conducted by investigators from each institution will illuminate the mechanisms responsible for asthma disparities and provide novel interventions in targeted minority groups at risk for morbidity from asthma.

"Asthma Disparities: Advancing Multilevel Causal Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Fifteen million Americans suffer from asthma, and the burden of morbidity appears to be rising. Asthma is also a major cause of health disparities among minority and low socio-economic groups. Yet the increasing prevalence and marked disparities in asthma remain largely unexplained by known risk factors, suggesting the potential role of community-level factors.  The aim of this application is to enable the candidate to undertake training and mentored research to address the question: what is the role of community and neighborhood-level processes in explaining the occurrence and distribution of asthma?     The candidate has expertise in multilevel statistical modeling with substantive interest in the social determinants of health. Over the next five years, the candidate will gain training in: (1) asthma epidemiology and pathophysiology, (2) the theory and measurement of neighborhood-level processes, and (3) causal inference within a multilevel framework.  Applying a multilevel approach that explicitly recognizes the embedding of asthma within its biologic, socioeconomic, environmental, and community contexts, the candidate will conduct mentored research to examine the causes of asthma disparities at different stages in the life-course.  The proposed analysis will be carried out within three ongoing studies (Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress; Boston Area Community Health Study; and Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods) in two American cities (Boston and Chicago). The research will examine the potential roles of neighborhood attributes such as structural disadvantage, collective psychosocial characteristics and physical environmental conditions in explaining the known disparities in the prevalence of asthma.  The proposed award will be used to develop an integrative and transdisciplinary approach to these issues, drawing on the rich resources available within Harvard University, including access to community-based study populations as well as to expertise from multiple fields.

"PEDIATRIC ASTHMA DISPARITIES: PERCEPTIONS AND MANAGEMENT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Pediatric asthma, the most common chronic illness of childhood, is increasing in prevalence, morbidity and mortality - particularly in minority children. This application seeks to establish the Rhode Island -Puerto Rico Asthma Center (RIPRAC) for reducing disparities in asthma among Latino children. Brown University faculty involved with an extensive pediatric asthma research program will join with epidemiologists, clinicians, and health services researchers from the minority serving University of Puerto Rico to study potentially overlooked determinants of disparity. An ambitious training component (based on a successful T32 research training program) will involve individuals from both sites at both sites.      The RIPRAC Research AIMS include four projects that seek to understand the causes of disparities at multiple levels - the biomedical, the individual/family, and the socioenvironmental level. The four projects, respectively, will 1) examine discrepancies between the diagnosis of asthma as assessed by parental report, the primary care medical record and our systematic diagnosis base on the NHLBI guidelines; 2) assess characteristics (prescription practices, shared decision making, continuity and access to care) of the health care system that may differentially affect asthma morbidity; 3) evaluate family beliefs, the burden of asthma management and medication adherence as they affect asthma morbidity and health care utilization in Latino and Anglo children; and 4) study the relation of symptom perception to pediatric asthma discrepancies.

"Improving Health Literacy to Reduce Asthma Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in asthma morbidity and mortality by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) have been repeatedly documented. Low literacy may contribute to asthma disparities, yet prior asthma interventions have not satisfactorily addressed this literacy barrier; even though as many as half of adults living with asthma and caregivers to children with asthma have limited literacy skills. Multimedia and enhanced print materials may be effective bridge tools to help community asthma workers and pharmacists convey asthma knowledge and teach proper self-management in a manner that is accessible to a lower literate audience. The purpose of this research is to support the mentorship and research training of Dr. Michael Wolf at Northwestern University to develop Asthma Self Management Enabling (ASME) Materials that target education and empowerment messages to inner-city adults with asthma or caregivers to affected children to 'prime' these individuals to maximize their benefit from asthma self-management programs. The ASME materials will include a multimedia program and ""enhanced print"" handout; both designed to be accessible to a lower literate audience and be culturally appropriate. Training and research activities will be nested in an ongoing study led by the Primary Sponsor of this proposal (K. Weiss), and will include: 1) analyses of longitudinal data to better understand direct and indirect pathways through which literacy and cultural influences impact asthma self-management behaviors, 2) Use findings from those analyses to guide qualitative research activities for the development, refinement, and pilot testing of the ASME materials, and 3) field test the ASME materials among adults with asthma and caregivers to children with asthma, to see if the materials improve coping, knowledge, and self-efficacy. Findings from this research will support grant submissions for a more substantial evaluation of the materials; I will also explore opportunities to translate this methodology to the self-management of other chronic diseases.

"COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP TO REDUCE ASTHMA DISPARITIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric asthma is increasingly common among minority children, and results in considerable healthcare disparity. This application seeks to establish a Community Partnership between Rhode Island Hospital and the Providence Community Health Centers to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to increase use of controller medications for asthma among Latino and African-American children. A Community Advisory Board of parents and key informants will provide ongoing input regarding treatment implementation. Families with children who have persistent asthma symptoms will be enrolled. Three groups will be recruited (N=240 total): African-American families, Latino families who prefer health care in Spanish, and Latino families who prefer health care in English. All families will be enrolled in a brief baseline period. Children who are prescribed oral or inhaled controller medications will have medication use monitored electronically. Research staff will also collect data regarding baseline medication use from pharmacy records and insurance claims. Asthma knowledge, medication beliefs, medication adherence, and asthma morbidity will be assessed at baseline, end of treatment, and at 3-month intervals until 1 year post-treatment. After completing a baseline, all families will attend a group-based asthma education class in their own Community Health Center (one of five CHC's). Families will the be randomized to one of two nurse delivered interventions, either 1) a Standard Care (SC) condition, which emphasizes use of symptom monitoring, peak flow meter, trigger control measures, and a written action plan, or 2) a Medication Adherence (MA) condition, which assesses use of alternative medications, addresses concerns regarding use of controller medications, and uses problem-solving techniques to address barriers to medication use. Follow-up is conducted by researcher assistants at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month time points post-intervention. It is expected that both interventions will increase asthma knowledge, but the MA intervention will yield greater controller medication use and decreased morbidity. It is further expected that differences in medication adherence post-treatment will be mediated by medication beliefs. Lastly, it is anticipated that within the Latino groups, Latinos with low English proficiency will demonstrate the greatest changes from baseline on medication adherence and morbidity. A Sustainability Advisory board will provide guidance regarding project implementation in the community beyond the life of the grant.               ",COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP TO REDUCE ASTHMA DISPARITIES,7033098,R01NR008524,"['clinical trial ', ' inhalation drug administration ', ' health education ', ' family structure /dynamics ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' health care quality ', ' community health service ', ' patient care management ', ' health care service availability ', ' health economics ', ' human subject ', ' asthma ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' health behavior ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' culture ', ' therapy compliance ', ' oral administration ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' respiratory disease /disorder therapy ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NINR,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2006,368431,0.17557440466620072
"Asthma Surveillance and Education in Preschool Settings DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a non-randomized, controlled, prospective trial to test the efficacy of a bilingual intervention to improve asthma care for low-income inner-city children enrolled in subsidized preschool childcare programs. Because of high rates of asthma prevalence, subsidized preschool childcare programs offer ideal settings to test innovative strategies to improve asthma care within communities at highest risk of morbidity. There are three intervention arms to this study. Surveillance - identifying the children that have diagnosed asthma and requiring written asthma action plans from their providers. Surveillance plus monitoring - adds a system to track parent compliance with the asthma action plan requirement. Surveillance plus monitoring plus education - adds individualized asthma education to promote adherence and a partnership between parent and doctor. This design aims to test whether a monthly monitoring system increases the proportion of parents who obtain written asthma action plans compared with parents in the surveillance only arm. It also aims to compare parents who receive individualized asthma education with parents in the surveillance and monitoring arm as to the proportion who are prescribed controller medications, who regularly administer controller medications to the child, and who report persistent asthma symptoms, Emergency Department visits and hospitalization for asthma. To test these aims, the three arms will be implemented in subsidized childcare programs in East Harlem, the Lower East Side and the South Bronx - 3 geographically separate New York City communities with high rates of asthma prevalence. A total of 191 parents of asthmatic children aged 2.8-4 years old will be recruited into the study. Interviews will be conducted at baseline, 4, 8 and 12-month follow-up. Because of the non-randomized design, additional intervention components will be phased in at program sites to verify that effects are due to intervention rather than community differences. Baseline measures of the three groups will be compared and multivariate models will be used to address key research hypotheses in this study. This study will provide data on efforts at the institutional and individual levels that can be directed to reducing asthma morbidity in populations most heavily impacted by the disease.

"Social Support and Education in Asthma Follow-Up    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our previous NHLBI-supported study (HL 57232) showed that a combination treatment of ""Coaching"" through follow-up phone calls 2 and 5 days following an index ED visit plus monetary incentive was highly effective in increasing the percentage of low-income urban children who received recommended primary care within 2 weeks of the ED visit for asthma, 44% in the intervention group vs 29% in usual care (p = 0.0004). However, the intervention was not associated with significant differences in morbidity (subsequent ED visits). We conclude that the intervention was effective in promoting the initial link to primary care, but was not effective in sustaining that link or management practices to minimize acuity of symptoms during exacerbation. Here we propose an expansion of the intervention initiated at the time of an ED visit for asthma to promote ongoing primary care and effective asthma management. Parents of low-income, urban, predominantly African American children, aged 2 - 12 years will be recruited at the time of their children's ED visits for acute wheezing. The experimental Intervention is designed to reduce morbidity from recurrent asthma through ongoing education and social support to encourage long-term primary care and adherence to recommended asthma management practices. It will include: 1) as in our previous study, monetary incentive to visit the PCP in order to start the process of ongoing care; 2) as in our previous study, contact by an asthma ""Coach,"" but now extended through 12 months following the ED visit and focusing not only on attending primary care as recommended but also on parent adherence to asthma management strategies developed with the primary care provider (PCP); and 3) telemedicine provided by asthma nurses to reinforce asthma management strategies and assess the status of the child's asthma continued through 6 months following the index ED visit. After informed consent, cases will be randomly assigned to either Usual Care or Intervention, stratified by PCP clinic. All children will receive standardized/usual ED care to resolve wheezing and standardized discharge advice. Follow-up to assess study outcomes will be scheduled every 6 months from the time of randomization of each case and continue for 24 months following randomization. Intended impacts on patterns of care will be assessed by proportions of children who have a visit to their PCP for asthma planning within 2 weeks after the index ED visit and [3]1 subsequent PCP visit for regular care that includes asthma planning during the 24 months of follow-up. Primary outcome will be asthma morbidity, as indexed by the proportion of children who have at least one ED visit during the 24-month follow-up period. Additional outcomes will include the proportion of children who have at least 1 hospitalization, the proportion of participants with [3]1 visit to the PCP for acute asthma, and the net cost of asthma-related care, all through the 24 months of intervention and follow-up. Planned enrolment is 248 subjects (124 per group) to provide 80% power at p = .05 to detect a reduction of ED visits of 20%. Because the primary outcome can be obtained from medical records after consent even if phone contact cannot be maintained, intent to treat model will be used for analyses.

"EFFICACY OF WRITTEN TREATMENT PLANS IN ASTHMA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective self-management of asthma requires that patients or their caregivers recognize the early symptoms of an exacerbation and initiate appropriate interventions aimed at preventing the progression of symptoms. Most asthma clinical guidelines suggest that the incorporation of a written self-management plan is an essential tool that patients must possess, be able to understand, and follow if they are to respond appropriately to changes in asthma status. Nevertheless, there are no controlled trials examining the efficacy of the written plan itself. Furthermore, even if written plans are an essential and an effective component of successful self-management, the data suggest that few patients receive them. Barriers to the use of written plans need more study if patients and physicians are to increase their use of this tool. Additionally, studies are needed to examine the efficacy of written plans across different patient populations. The overall goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of a model, written treatment plan in a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) compared with the usual care that is provided by a group of adult and pediatric pulmonologists and allergists in their practice settings. The model plan is a form that allows a treatment regimen consistent with NHLBI guidelines to be conveyed to patients. An additional goal is to assess how patients from different racial/ethnic backgrounds utilize treatments plans. Specific aims: 1) to identify barriers to the use of written plans and determine whether these barriers differ across racial/ethnic groups; 2) to develop, validate, and pilot test a model written treatment plan form plus instructions to doctors for its use; and 3) to conduct a RCT of the model plan form with African-American, Latino, and non-Latino white patients to: a) assess the efficacy of the plan across patient populations and b) determine if using written plans reduce racial/ethnic disparities in asthma outcomes. We hypothesize that patients with asthma who receive the model written plan form will have, relative to patients in the control group, significantly greater improvement in 3 primary outcome measures: 1.1) reduction in asthma symptom frequency; 1.2) reduction in emergency use of health care services; and 1.3) improved quality of life. We will also examine 4 secondary outcome measures: 1.4) asthma hospitalizations; 1.5) days with activity restriction; 1.6) the proportion of patients in the intervention group who receive the plan during the initial visit; and 1.7) use of the plans by patients.         ",EFFICACY OF WRITTEN TREATMENT PLANS IN ASTHMA,7102570,R01HL073955,"['patient care management ', ' patient care planning ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care personnel performance ', ' human subject ', ' asthma ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,697212,0.31828880405636656
"HOWARD/HOPKINS CENTER FOR REDUCING ASTHMA DISPARTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma and marked   improvements in the therapies available to treat asthma, disadvantaged and minority communities still carry a disproportionate burden from asthma. The exact reasons for this phenomenon are unknown, however, a number of factors have been proposed to account for this disparity, including genetic differences in vulnerability to asthma or asthma severity, differential rates of environmental exposure (e.g. cockroaches, dust), differences in the accessibility and quality of asthma medical care for patients of differing socioeconomic status, and inadequate asthma self-management practices, including poor adherence with therapy. It is widely believed that these factors interact to cause the observed excess burden of asthma within low-income, minority populations. Howard University and Johns Hopkins University have a long and successful history of collaborative studies designed to evaluate asthma morbidity in low-income, African-American children and adults with asthma. This application draws on this rich history to propose the formal collaboration of these institutions and investigators as a part of the Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities. Specifically, this application presents four research projects designed to collaboratively investigate factors associated with the disproportionate burden of asthma experienced by inner-city, African-American children and adults. This application includes studies that will evaluate both the underlying genetic factors that may contribute to the observed excess risk in African-American communities, as well as studies of provider-patient communication designed to assess intervention strategies for remediating this risk. In addition, an essential goal of the Howard/Hopkins Center for Reducing Asthma Disparities will be to create a culturally sensitive training environment that is truly reciprocal, and designed to both enrich and enhance the research potential and asthma management capabilities of both participating institutions.

"Communities Organized Against Asthma and Lead (COAL) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Communities Organized Against Asthma and Lead: Project COAL (Communidades organizadas contra asthma y plomo) will be a partnership between De Madres a Madres, Inc. in Houston, TX, The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Casa de Amigos Health Center, and the Environmental Justice Clinic at Texas Southern University School of Law.  The partnership will bring together a well-established and respected community based organization in the Near North Side community of Houston, with Environmental Toxicologists in the NIEHS Center at UTMB, health care providers at the Harris County Hospital District Clinic serving the Near North Side, and attorneys and law students with a history of response to environmental health problems in disadvantaged communities.  This partnership will address two pressing environmental problems in the homes of this community: exposure of children to lead, from paint, and to agents that can trigger asthma.  We will address these issues first through a novel approach to communication using theater as a means to educate and to elicit responses from the community.  This approach will inform the community about Project COAL and provide local knowledge from the community to the partners in this project.  The second focus of the project will be to serve the needs of residents in the community by making assessments of their homes to identify sources of lead and agents that can trigger asthma.  Paint samples will be tested for lead.  Levels of allergens (dust mites, mold spores, pollen) in the air will be determined, irritant chemicals and allergens from insects and rodents will be measured.  UTMB will train local resident home assessment teams and perform the laboratory tests.  Residents will be given training to enable them to reduce or eliminate these hazards from their homes and they will receive consistent follow-up from the home assessment teams.

"Enhancing Prevention for Children in Diverse Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background and Candidate. Understanding and eliminating disparities in health is a national priority.  Black and Latino children bear a disproportionate burden of asthma, a leading cause of childhood morbidity.  Yet, minority children are less likely to be using appropriate preventive medications than white children.  This application requests a mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research (K24) for Dr. Tracy Lieu, MD, MPH, a nationally recognized pediatric health services researcher. Dr. Lieu has recently become Director of the new Center for Child Health Care Studies in her department at Harvard. Her goal is to enhance the adoption of effective preventive health interventions for children, especially minority children.  Her record demonstrates high productivity in funded research in asthma and vaccines.  Mentoring Plan. Dr. Lieu has a growing track record of mentoring and excellent opportunities to work with beginning investigators. She is responsible for three of the junior faculty in her new Center, all of whom are within their first three years. She is also the Children's Hospital Site Director of the Harvard Pediatric Health Services Research Fellowship Program. This K24 award is needed to protect Dr. Lieu's time for guiding these beginning investigators as they establish their research portfolios.      Research Plan. The proposed research in this K24 award builds on Dr. Lieu's ongoing NICHD-supported R01 on racial/ethnic disparities in medication use by children with persistent asthma. The aims are to:   1. Conduct a prospective cohort study to evaluate parent-provider communication patterns and health beliefs as predictors of preventive medication adoption and influenza vaccination among black, Latino, and white children with persistent asthma; and   2. Analyze existing data to identify practice site policies as well as clinician and patient-level predictors of preventive medication adoption among a diverse group of children with persistent asthma.      Summary. This application offers a combination of a highly successful researcher in an intellectually rich environment. The proposed award will enable Dr. Lieu to protect time for mentoring beginning investigators and expand her research in improving preventive health care for diverse populations of children.

"NEIGHBORHOOD & HEALTH CARE EFFECTS IN CHILDHOOD ASTHMA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epidemiological studies have shown the importance of environmental risk factors and access to health care in childhood asthma health outcomes. Current knowledge suggests that both physical (e.g., exposure to a variety of allergens, toxins, and other factors, such as moisture, mold, and pollution) and social components (e.g., stress, family structure, and other poverty-related factors) contribute to disease etiology and expression. The proposed research builds on Dr. Lara's experience as Principal Investigator of the Allies Against Asthma in Puerto Rico demonstration project in the Luis Llorens Torres Residential Project in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This community - the largest low-cost housing project in the United States and the Caribbean - has a high- risk socio-demographic profile that can affect asthma: almost one-third of households are headed by unwed mothers; over half of residents have monthly incomes under $500; and unemployment and apathy toward educational activities is high. We propose to perform secondary analyses of a uniquely rich and existing geo-coded dataset for this Puerto Rico study, to meet the following specific aims: (1) to explore the risk factors associated with asthma prevalence, and poor symptom control and quality of life in this population, including individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics of the social environment (e.g., health care access, crime exposure) and physical environment (e.g., smoking in the household, outdoor pollution); (2) to determine whether geographic clusters of high asthma prevalence and morbidity occur in the neighborhoods studied and, if so, whether social and physical neighborhood characteristics are associated with this clustering effect; and, (3) to determine if differences exist in the effectiveness of the Allies Against Asthma intervention across subsets of the studied population with different neighborhood social and physical environment characteristics. Forty to fifty percent of Island Puerto Rican children are estimated to have childhood asthma - the highest reported prevalence of asthma of all U.S. children. The proposed study provides a unique opportunity to better understand the factors contributing to the disproportionate burden of asthma this population experiences. Our dataset contains geo-coded information on site of residence and schooling of all study participants, as well as possible neighborhood physical and social environmental contextual factors that can contribute to this asthma disparity among Puerto Ricans. The study findings can also be highly relevant to interventions to reduce asthma disparities in other Hispanic and non-Hispanic high-risk children. Forty to fifty percent of Island Puerto Rican children are estimated to have childhood asthma - the highest reported prevalence of asthma of all U.S. children. The proposed study provides a unique opportunity to better understand how environmental factors and neighborhood characteristics contribute to the disproportionate burden of asthma this population experiences.          ",NEIGHBORHOOD & HEALTH CARE EFFECTS IN CHILDHOOD ASTHMA,7257371,R03HD051768,"['Crime ', ' Ally ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Caribbean natives ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Household Heads ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Site ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Allergens ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Island ', ' Learning ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Funding ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mothers ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Poverty ', ' Exposure to ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Molds ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Pollution ', ' Toxin ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States ', ' Wood material ', ' Wood ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' family structure ', ' Population Study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R03,2007,95437,0.3546386092554107
"Literacy and improving patient-clinician encounters for Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Low literacy is widespread and particularly prevalent among low-income and minority groups, the same groups in which asthma morbidity is excessive. Inattention by clinicians to the literacy and related health literacy of patients may result in ineffective communication and subsequent poor patient self-management. Some aspects of health literacy such as understanding numerical concepts may be particularly important. We recently developed and validated an asthma-specific numeracy questionnaire (ANQ). We found that many adults do not understand the numerical concepts embedded in standard asthma education. Those with low ANQ scores were also more likely to have had hospitalizations and ED visits for asthma. The initial aims of this application are to use the participants and outcomes of the parent R01 HL073932 to conduct a cohort study to examine the association of (Specific Aim 1) a standard health literacy instrument and (Specific   Aim 2) ANQ with adherence to inhaled steroids (measured electronically), asthma control (FEV1), and asthma-related quality of life in adults with moderate or severe asthma. The parent R01 HL073932 addresses another barrier to successful asthma care involving patient-clinician interaction. It is a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of a behavioral individualized intervention, problem-solving (PS) with standard asthma education (Attention Control (AC)), on these same outcomes. PS seeks to empower lowincome and minority asthmatic adults and allows clinicians to take account of the social context of these patients' lives. Exploratory Aim 3 will examine the interaction between literacy and PS versus AC interventions. We will use focus groups of patients and clinicians to refine the ANQ as a brief individualized assessment for clinicians. We will then develop and pilot an intervention to test whether ANQ-based individualized interventions result in improved adherence and asthma outcomes (Specific Aim 4). This will lead to subsequent research applications to test whether ANQ-based interventions alone or combined with   PS results in better asthma outcomes and adherence. That is, we anticipate that both PS and ANQ will lead to simple brief additive or synergistic ways for clinicians to assess patients and tailor information. My Overarching Research Goal is examine barriers to asthma care that operate at the interface between patient and clinician and that may differentially affect members of ethnic and racial minority groups with my ultimate goal being to design and implement ways to reduce such health disparities. This K02 application will allow me to continue along my current trajectory to become an independent investigator focusing on strategies directed at both clinicians and patients. By enhancing current collaborations, building others, and participating in relevant research working groups, I will create a team of expert collaborators in health and literacy, education, bioenqineerinq (directed at behavior measurement), and behavioral medicine        (End of Abstract)          ",Literacy and improving patient-clinician encounters for Asthma,7251032,K02HL088469,[''],NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K02,2007,105219,0.21021921912792746
"COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP TO REDUCE ASTHMA DISPARITIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric asthma is increasingly common among minority children, and results in considerable healthcare disparity. This application seeks to establish a Community Partnership between Rhode Island Hospital and the Providence Community Health Centers to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to increase use of controller medications for asthma among Latino and African-American children. A Community Advisory Board of parents and key informants will provide ongoing input regarding treatment implementation. Families with children who have persistent asthma symptoms will be enrolled. Three groups will be recruited (N=240 total): African-American families, Latino families who prefer health care in Spanish, and Latino families who prefer health care in English. All families will be enrolled in a brief baseline period. Children who are prescribed oral or inhaled controller medications will have medication use monitored electronically. Research staff will also collect data regarding baseline medication use from pharmacy records and insurance claims. Asthma knowledge, medication beliefs, medication adherence, and asthma morbidity will be assessed at baseline, end of treatment, and at 3-month intervals until 1 year post-treatment. After completing a baseline, all families will attend a group-based asthma education class in their own Community Health Center (one of five CHC's). Families will the be randomized to one of two nurse delivered interventions, either 1) a Standard Care (SC) condition, which emphasizes use of symptom monitoring, peak flow meter, trigger control measures, and a written action plan, or 2) a Medication Adherence (MA) condition, which assesses use of alternative medications, addresses concerns regarding use of controller medications, and uses problem-solving techniques to address barriers to medication use. Follow-up is conducted by researcher assistants at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month time points post-intervention. It is expected that both interventions will increase asthma knowledge, but the MA intervention will yield greater controller medication use and decreased morbidity. It is further expected that differences in medication adherence post-treatment will be mediated by medication beliefs. Lastly, it is anticipated that within the Latino groups, Latinos with low English proficiency will demonstrate the greatest changes from baseline on medication adherence and morbidity. A Sustainability Advisory board will provide guidance regarding project implementation in the community beyond the life of the grant.               ",COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP TO REDUCE ASTHMA DISPARITIES,7212279,R01NR008524,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Electronics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Family ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Foundations ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Insurance ', ' Language ', ' African ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Nurses ', ' Parents ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Problem Solving ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Condition ', ' Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Writing ', ' Oral ', ' Techniques ', ' Class ', ' meter ', ' Belief ', ' preference ', ' nursing intervention ', ' skills ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Health behavior change ', ' treatment effect ', ' ']",NINR,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2007,373030,0.17557440466620072
"Asthma Disparities: Advancing Multilevel Causal Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Fifteen million Americans suffer from asthma, and the burden of morbidity appears to be rising. Asthma is also a major cause of health disparities among minority and low socio-economic groups. Yet the increasing prevalence and marked disparities in asthma remain largely unexplained by known risk factors, suggesting the potential role of community-level factors.  The aim of this application is to enable the candidate to undertake training and mentored research to address the question: what is the role of community and neighborhood-level processes in explaining the occurrence and distribution of asthma?     The candidate has expertise in multilevel statistical modeling with substantive interest in the social determinants of health. Over the next five years, the candidate will gain training in: (1) asthma epidemiology and pathophysiology, (2) the theory and measurement of neighborhood-level processes, and (3) causal inference within a multilevel framework.  Applying a multilevel approach that explicitly recognizes the embedding of asthma within its biologic, socioeconomic, environmental, and community contexts, the candidate will conduct mentored research to examine the causes of asthma disparities at different stages in the life-course.  The proposed analysis will be carried out within three ongoing studies (Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress; Boston Area Community Health Study; and Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods) in two American cities (Boston and Chicago). The research will examine the potential roles of neighborhood attributes such as structural disadvantage, collective psychosocial characteristics and physical environmental conditions in explaining the known disparities in the prevalence of asthma.  The proposed award will be used to develop an integrative and transdisciplinary approach to these issues, drawing on the rich resources available within Harvard University, including access to community-based study populations as well as to expertise from multiple fields.

"Multisystemic therapy to reduce health disparities in adolescents with asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common cause of hospitalization in children other than infections. The Health People 2000 initiative to reduce asthma hospitalizations was NOT met. Minority, inner city children, particularly adolescents, appear to be most at risk for high morbidity and mortality. Poor illness management is thought to be a primary driver of asthma morbidity and mortality. Yet, there are very few randomized controlled trials with inner city adolescents with asthma. Because of the complexity of asthma management and the associated barriers, intensive, multi-component interventions are needed to improve outcomes among those at highest risk. The investigators have adapted Multisystemic Therapy (MST), an innovative home- and community-based psychotherapy, to successfully improve treatment adherence and outcomes in urban pediatric medical populations. The objective of the present study is to utilize MST to improve asthma management and to reduce health care utilization (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) among high risk African American adolescents (ages 12-16) with moderate to severe persistent asthma. High risk is defined as having >=2 emergency department visits or >= 1 hospitalizations in 12 months). Additional aims are to determine the stability of MST's effects over a 12 month interval and to determine cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Families will be recruited from the only university-affiliated medical center in Detroit, Michigan. Detroit has the highest percentage of African Americans of any major city in the United States. The experimental design for the proposed study is a randomized controlled trial with 170 high risk African American adolescents with moderate to severe persistent asthma, 85 of whom will receive standard multidisciplinary specialty care (control condition) and 85 of whom will receive this care plus MST. Families will complete an initial data collection session (baseline), a 7-month post-test designed to coincide with treatment completion, and a subsequent post-test at 12 months after baseline. If successful, this intervention will provide immediate assistance to a vulnerable population disproportionately affected by asthma and may reduce costs of care for this high risk population. While asthma is the second most common cause of hospitalization in children, minority, inner city teens are at increased risk for complications from the disease. We are testing the effectiveness of an intervention for inner city African American teens with asthma using Multisystemic Therapy an intensive, home- and community-based psychotherapy. If successful, this intervention will improve asthma management and overall health, as well as reduce healthcare costs for this vulnerable population disproportionately affected by asthma.          ",Multisystemic therapy to reduce health disparities in adolescents with asthma,7383419,R01HL087272,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Innovative Therapy ', ' Healthy People 2000 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Rate ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Family psychotherapy ', ' Family Therapy ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Affect ', ' Secondary to ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Chronic ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' African ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Michigan ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity -

"Racial/ethnic differences in symptom perception in childhood asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The greatest racial/ethnic disparity in pediatric asthma exists between the two largest Latino ethnic groups in the United States. Puerto Rican children have the highest asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality rates, and Mexican-American children have the lowest rates. African-American children are also disproportionately affected by asthma and have high levels of morbidity. Identification of mechanisms that may contribute to these disparities is a critical goal for asthma research. At the present time, there is a surprising gap in the literature regarding children's asthma symptom perception accuracy among specific racial/ethnic groups. Additionally, little is known about how racial/ethnic differences in parental beliefs and mental health may affect children's symptom perception and asthma morbidity. The research plan will involve a cross-sectional comparison of 40 African-American, 40 Puerto Rican, and 40 Mexican-American children with asthma between ages 7-11 and their primary caregivers. Families will be recruited from two city hospitals that predominantly serve families of low SES in the Bronx, NY. The study will involve a baseline session followed by 5 weeks of monitoring of children's asthma symptom perception ability and use of asthma medications in naturalistic settings. A second testing session will occur at a 5-week follow- up. Parent measures will include asthma beliefs, family support, acculturation, and assessment of major depression and abridged somatization using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Child measures will include depression, somatization, emotions during asthma attacks, and acculturation. Dependent measures will include use of PRN medication, functional morbidity, and asthma-related emergency room visits. Groups will be matched on clinician-rated asthma severity documented in medical charts. The primary aims of this small grant are to: a) examine children's asthma symptom perception and PRN medication use among African-American, Puerto Rican, and Mexican-American children, and b) compare parents' mental health, health beliefs, and family support across racial/ethnic groups, and c) examine the relationship between parents' level of acculturation and children's asthma symptom perception and morbidity among Puerto Rican and Mexican-American families. An exploratory aim is to examine whether pathways involving children's psychological symptoms, children's asthma symptom perception, and parent factors mediate racial/ethnic differences on PRN medication use and asthma morbidity. This study is designed to identify parent and child factors that may contribute to asthma morbidity and symptom perception in a differential manner among African-American, Puerto Rican, and Mexican-American children. The long-term objective of this research program is the development of culturally sensitive family interventions designed to reduce asthma morbidity and hence, disparities among ethnic minority children. This research will help support the NIH mission to reduce health disparities by focusing on asthma among inner-city, ethnic minority children. Examining behavioral predictors of disparities among African-American, Puerto Rican, and Mexican-American families may help inform culturally sensitive guidelines for provider care and family management of asthma.          ",Racial/ethnic differences in symptom perception in childhood asthma,7530277,R03HD053355,"['Provider ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emotions ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' International ', ' Subgroup ', ' Monitor ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Guidelines ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Interview ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mission ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' New York ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' United States ', ' Week ', ' Severities ', ' Side ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Belief ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' family management ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' family influence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NICHD,YESHIVA UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,83000,0.37640657795929894
"Asthma Disparities: Advancing Multilevel Causal Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Fifteen million Americans suffer from asthma, and the burden of morbidity appears to be rising. Asthma is also a major cause of health disparities among minority and low socio-economic groups. Yet the increasing prevalence and marked disparities in asthma remain largely unexplained by known risk factors, suggesting the potential role of community-level factors.  The aim of this application is to enable the candidate to undertake training and mentored research to address the question: what is the role of community and neighborhood-level processes in explaining the occurrence and distribution of asthma?     The candidate has expertise in multilevel statistical modeling with substantive interest in the social determinants of health. Over the next five years, the candidate will gain training in: (1) asthma epidemiology and pathophysiology, (2) the theory and measurement of neighborhood-level processes, and (3) causal inference within a multilevel framework.  Applying a multilevel approach that explicitly recognizes the embedding of asthma within its biologic, socioeconomic, environmental, and community contexts, the candidate will conduct mentored research to examine the causes of asthma disparities at different stages in the life-course.  The proposed analysis will be carried out within three ongoing studies (Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress; Boston Area Community Health Study; and Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods) in two American cities (Boston and Chicago). The research will examine the potential roles of neighborhood attributes such as structural disadvantage, collective psychosocial characteristics and physical environmental conditions in explaining the known disparities in the prevalence of asthma.  The proposed award will be used to develop an integrative and transdisciplinary approach to these issues, drawing on the rich resources available within Harvard University, including access to community-based study populations as well as to expertise from multiple fields.

"Development of a Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite higher levels of morbidity and mortality, African American children receive asthma care that is less consistent with national asthma guideline recommendations compared to white children. Access to care, insurance status and socioeconomic status have not fully explained these disparities. Poor assessments of asthma morbidity and suboptimal communication between physicians and parents of inner-city children with asthma may contribute racial disparities in quality of asthma care. We propose to examine the effects of an asthma-focused communication intervention on parent-physician communication and quality of asthma care among inner-city African American children. The objective of this project is to design, validate and implement an effective Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument (P-ACCI) within an innercity- based, university pediatric clinic. We therefore propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To develop and validate a simple, paper-and-pencil pediatric asthma control and communication instrument (P-ACCI) to serve as a both a prompt and a communication aide for the physician and the parent to discuss issues of asthma health; 2) To conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial in a primary care pediatric setting of inner-city African American children with asthma in order to assess the effects of the P-ACCI on the quality of patientphysician communication and quality of asthma care. We hypothesize that: 1) the P-ACCI is a valid measure of asthma morbidity; 2) regular use of the P-ACCI will improve the quality of parent-physician communication and the quality of asthma care for children. Relevance: There is a pressing need for simple, low-cost clinical strategies applicable in diverse settings to improve communication about variables important to asthma management. Such strategies would enhance clinical judgment, decision-making, and quality of asthma care. The current study will evaluate a novel, lowcost tool with the potential to reduce asthma care disparities related to poor parent-physician communication My career goals involve becoming a successful investigator of racial disparities in quality of asthma care, and to become a Professor of Pediatrics who develops remedies to improve asthma care through a multidisciplinary research center, and to reduce racial disparities in asthma care and asthma outcomes.

"Whole Genome Analyses for Asthma in Latino Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, asthma prevalence is highest in Puerto Ricans (26%) and lowest in Mexicans (10%). This is paradoxical since both groups are considered ""Hispanic"" or ""Latino"". Although there are many potential explanations for this observation, including environmental and socioeconomic factors, one potential explanation is that the genetic predisposition to asthma differs among subgroups within the Latino population. Latinos are admixed and share varying proportions of African, Native American and European ancestry. The mixed ancestry of Latinos provides unique opportunities in epidemiological and genetic studies and may be useful in untangling complex gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in disease susceptibility. This proposal will take advantage of clinical data and genomic DNA on 2,100 Puerto Rican and 1,500 Mexican asthma cases and controls collected as part of two large studies of asthma in Latinos (GALA 1 and GALA 2). The goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide association analyses to identify genetic factors associated with asthma and related phenotypes in Puerto Ricans and Mexicans. In addition, potential interactions between these genetic factors and other genes and environmental variables will be investigated. Specifically, we will: 1) genotype Puerto Rican and Mexican asthma cases and controls using the Affymetrix state-of-art 500K GeneChip arrays, 2) perform genome-wide association analysis on 500K GeneChip data to identify SNPs associated with asthma, asthma severity and bronchodilator response. The analysis will include clinical and demographic characteristics, environmental factors and individual admixture estimates to correct for potential confounders. In addition, admixture mapping analysis will be performed to complement the genome-wide association analysis. Admixture mapping may identify novel regions that harbor racial/ethnic specific alleles for asthma and related phenotypes; and 3) fine map SNPs significantly associated with asthma and related phenotypes in genome-wide analyses (initial-hit SNPs). To our knowledge this is the first proposal to perform a genome-wide association analysis for asthma and related phenotypes in Latinos. Due to the size and scope of this project, the results of this study should substantially increase our understanding of the etiology of asthma and drug response. By gaining a better understanding of asthma risk factors in diverse populations, this proposal is consistent with the goals established by Healthy People 2010, which are to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population.           ",Whole Genome Analyses for Asthma in Latino Populations,7370249,R01HL088133,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' genetic association ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Native Americans ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins ', ' Arts ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' United States ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' size ', ' respiratory ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' American ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene interaction ', ' Bronchodilator Agents ', ' lumen dilator ', ' Bronchodilators ', ' Bronchial-Dilating Agents ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' GALA ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Genomics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' SNP genotyping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Map ', ' SNP Map ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Custom ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Albuterol ', ' Ventolin ', ' Salbutamol ', ' Proventil ', ' 2-t-Butylamino-1-(4-hydroxy-3-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethyl)phenylethanol ', ' 1,3-Benzenedimethanol, alpha1-(((1,1-dimethylethyl)amino)methyl)-4-hydroxy- ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Mexican ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,760540,0.3444775116787472
"Adolescent-Parent-Provider Communication in Latinos with Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma remains a significant public health concern for pediatric populations and disproportionately impacts ethnic minorities. Youth appear to be at heightened risk for asthma morbidity during adolescence. Research has begun to identify factors that contribute to asthma disparities. Key issues in patient-provider communication, especially for Latinos, may play a role. For adolescents in particular, communication with asthma care providers may be important for successful asthma management and the maintenance of positive clinical outcomes.   The present study proposes to examine adolescent-parent-provider communication in Latino and non-   Latino white youth with asthma, employing both archival data analysis and original data collection methods. Archival data will be made available through the NHLBI funded study entitled ""Pediatric Asthma Disparities: Perceptions and Management,"" which is a joint effort by the Rhode Island-Puerto Rico Asthma Center (RIPRAC; Grant #U01-H1072438; PI G. Fritz). RIPRAC, which was established in 2002, is one of the four NHLBI centers funded to study asthma health disparities.   Quantitative analyses will identify sociocultural factors relating to adolescent-parent-provider communication and associations between adolescent-parent-provider communication and clinical outcomes for Latino and non-Latino white adolescents with asthma. Focus group data will provide an in-depth account of parent and adolescent perspectives of adolescent-parent-provider communication. Using a theory-based model in conjunction with quantitative and qualitative analyses will increase the methodological rigor of this study. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will inform future research regarding adolescent-parent-provider communication and its relation to existing asthma health disparities, and serve as a model for assessing adolescent-parent-provider communication in chronic health conditions with diverse patient groups. Ultimately, this study will facilitate design of future interventions to improve adolescent-parent-provider communication and clinical outcomes, thereby ameliorating existing health disparities for Latino youth and adolescents with asthma.             ",Adolescent-Parent-Provider Communication in Latinos with Asthma,7545125,F32HL094036,"['design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Language ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' Inferior ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' parental role ', ' parent role ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' desire ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' ']",NHLBI,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,F32,2008,45056,0.32728726343512
"Chicago Westside Partnership for Children's Asthma Initiative (CWPC-AI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Asthma is one condition that disproportionately affects poor and minority children living in inner-city neighborhoods. African American children have some of the highest rates documented, and Chicago has been shown to be among the hardest hit cities. The proposed project, the Chicago Westside Partnership for Children's Asthma Initiative (CWPC-AI), aims to translate the Seattle-King County Healthy Homes (SKCHH) environmental intervention model into one that is culturally appropriate and effective for children with poorly controlled asthma living in the poor, African American Westside Chicago community of North Lawndale. A collaborative approach drawing on the strengths of several partners and incorporating full and meaningful participation by the community will be utilized. The initiative builds on the experiences of the Sinai Urban Health Institute (SUHI) and Sinai Children's Hospital (SCH) in conducting and evaluating home-based pediatric asthma interventions utilizing Community Health Workers (CHW). The Metropolitan Tenant's Organization (MTO) will provide support in training CHWs to conduct a thorough environmental assessment, and to work with families in modifying the home environment and behaviors in a way that will reduce exposure to asthma triggers. An MTO Housing Advocate will handle environmental situations beyond the expertise of the CHW. The initiative will also partner with SUHI's Breathing Freedom program, a North Lawndale community-based smoking cessation program, to reduce secondhand smoke exposure among children who have asthma. Attorneys working for Health & Disability Advocates (HDA) will provide pro bono assistance in resolving housing and other issues requiring legal intervention. The Sinai Community Institute (SCI) and Chicago Asthma Consortium (CAC) will build upon their strong community connections in assembling a Community Advisory Committee, which will be instrumental in guiding the intervention process and in developing key relationships necessary in ensuring the success of the initiative. Our goal is to enroll 360 children into CWPC-AI over an 18-month recruitment period, with the intention of completing the entire 12-month intervention with 250 (70%) of the enrolled participants. CHWs will make 5-6 home visits over the course of the intervention, during which they will comprehensively educate the family on asthma and its proper management, focusing heavily on both improving medical management (e.g., recognizing and reacting appropriately to asthma symptoms, medication techniques, etc.) and reducing exposure to home triggers. Referrals to MTO and HDA will be made as necessary. Evaluation activities will focus on documenting the process of the intervention and the associated outcomes (effectiveness). Monitoring of the process is particularly important as it will allow for an assessment of the intervention's translatability, documenting the successes and challenges of implementing the program within the target community, and paving the way for the translation of the initiative to other populations. Qualitative methods will supplement quantitative data collection in better documenting issues related to translatability, assessing both community strengths which facilitate implementation and challenges that impede upon it, and the process of addressing any barriers. One of the specific aims of the project is to significantly impact asthma-related measures of morbidity, urgent health resource utilization and quality of life. Therefore, progress will be monitored towards 2 primary goals (to decrease asthma-related morbidity and to improve quality of life) and 3 intermediate goals (to decrease the number of asthma triggers in the home environment, to improve asthma-related knowledge of the child's primary caregiver and to improve the caregiver's self-efficacy to properly manage asthma). In all instances, a pre-post study design will be utilized, with each participant serving as his/her own historical control. The study has more than adequate power to detect effect sizes that are clinically meaningful. Substantial attention will be paid to matters of fidelity, uptake and other issues that will influence translatability. Throughout, we will operate with the explicit goal of being able to sustain this project after the initial funding has expired. The community, Community Advisory Committee, and all partnering agencies, will work collaboratively to ensure that the approach and its effects are sustained. Through this collaborative approach and implementation of an evidence-based intervention it is believed that CWPC-AI will significantly impact asthma health disparities, ultimately helping to close the gap.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       African American children have been shown to have some of the highest rates of asthma documented, and Chicago has been demonstrated to be among the hardest hit cities.

"Comparison of Asthma Programs for Schools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Comparison of Asthma Programs for Schools (CAPS) study is to evaluate efficacy of a new developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling asthma health education program compared to a low-dose control, well-established, non-academic program. The new program for diverse fifth- grade students with asthma and their family caregivers is entitled, ""Staying Healthy Asthma Responsible & Prepared"" (SHARP). SHARP is a comprehensive, theory-driven, evidenced-guided program developed in collaboration with school personnel and members of one community asthma coalition that has two components: (a) a Student Component and (b) Community Component. The low-dose comparison group will receive Open Airways for Schools (OAS) that is widely disseminated through the American Lung Association. Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of SHARP compared to the low-dose OAS control group for fifth-grade students on cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral aspects of asthma management immediately post- and at 12 and 24 months post-intervention. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the long-term effect of SHARP compared to the low-dose OAS control group for fifth-grade students on condition characteristics, use of healthcare services, and quality of life at 12 and 24 months post intervention. A two-group, longitudinal, prospective, cluster- randomized, single-blinded trial will be used. Schools will be matched based on fifth-grade enrollment numbers, standardized reading and math scores, free/reduced lunch eligibility, and racial/ethnic proportions prior to randomization. The unit of analysis will be the student. The sample will consist of 2 cohorts of fifth- grade students, ages 9-12 years, with asthma and their caregivers. Two cohorts of student/caregiver dyads will be recruited over 2 years (N=152 dyads per year for a total of 304 dyads over two years) and analyzed separately. A minimum of 5-6 dyads will be recruited from 30 elementary schools located in three communities with 10 schools selected from each community. Participants will represent varying socioeconomic, cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. Recently retired certified elementary schoolteachers identified by the areas' school districts will be trained to serve as interveners to deliver SHARP or OAS during school hours. Evaluators will collect pre- and post-intervention data from dyads in the home using audio-linked data entry systems loaded on laptop computers at four time points. A bi-monthly automated voice recorded telephone survey will be placed to caregivers to monitor symptom days, medication use, use of healthcare services, and school absenteeism. To adjust for non-independence of observations within schools, hypotheses will be tested using the generalized estimating equations approach for categorical or ordinal variables and linear mixed models for continuous outcomes. After efficacy is demonstrated, this study would advance scientific knowledge through the offering of a comprehensive, developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling education program for older school age students with asthma that is not currently available. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nine million U.S. children under 18 years of age have been diagnosed with asthma at some point in their lives and approximately 4 million children have had an asthma episode in the last 12 months. This project seeks to compare efficacy of two school-based asthma education programs for fifth-grade students with asthma aimed at improving cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes; decreasing severity of illness; and improving quality of life. After efficacy is demonstrated, this study would advance scientific knowledge through the offering of a comprehensive, developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling education program for older school age students with asthma that is not currently available.             ",Comparison of Asthma Programs for Schools,7525351,R01NR010544,"['Counseling ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Purpose ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' American Lung Association ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Guidelines ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Hospitals ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Link ', ' Inhalators ', ' Inhaler ', ' Training ', ' Laws ', ' Numbers ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Fostering ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Single-Blind Study ', ' single-blind trial ', ' Michigan ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reading ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Sports ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Voice ', ' Hour ', ' day ', ' Week ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Score ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' respiratory ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Equation ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' laptop ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Friends ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Absenteeism ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' comparison group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' prospective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2008,394688,0.3960257574530354
"Reducing Asthma Disparities: The Baltimore City Healthy Homes Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract ""Reducing Asthma Disparities: The Baltimore City Healthy Homes Initiative"" (RAD) will reduce racial disparities in asthma morbidity in Baltimore by providing an evidence- based healthy homes intervention to the families of 250 Baltimore Public School students aged 4-18 who have persistent asthma. The RAD Initiative is a translation research project, adapting the effective Seattle-King County (SKC) model. The SKC Healthy Homes program has significantly reduced asthma symptom days and urgent health service usage (Krieger et al., 2005). We will enhance the SKC intervention to address risks specific to Baltimore through: 1) maternal depression screening and referrals, 2) strengthened rodent reduction measures, 3) lead poisoning prevention, 4) additional injury prevention, 5) motivational interviewing to reduce environmental tobacco smoke, and 6) recruitment through the schools. This translation research will compare and contrast the intervention costs, medical costs, home environmental health outcomes and children's asthma-related health outcomes in 250 intervention children and a comparable group of 250 non-intervention Medicaid enrolled children with persistent asthma. The RAD Initiative will be lead by the Baltimore City Health Department's Healthy Homes Division, whose mission is to improve the health of children and their families by reducing housing hazards tied to asthma, lead exposure, and injuries. In addition to helping the BCHD achieve its long-term goal of reducing asthma disparities, the RAD Initiative's specific aims include, first, disseminating project findings broadly to city, state, and national stakeholders through a Baltimore community conference, student-produced video, journal articles, community and conference presentations, and web-based information and materials. Second, the RAD Initiative will identify mechanisms by which the program can be sustained over time and scaled up to address the needs of all at-risk Baltimore families of children with asthma. Third, the RAD Initiative aims to use a coordinated, public-private partnership approach to extend the reach of healthy homes home visiting programs. The RAD Initiative represents the alliance of two universities, two city agencies, the state, Baltimore City's congressional delegation, a youth-focused social action organization, an asthma coalition, and a coalition of African-American charities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Project Narrative By adapting the Seattle King County Healthy Homes approach to the Baltimore environment and new research findings, we aim to reduce disparities related to childhood asthma, lead poisoning, and injuries.

"NEIGHBORHOOD & HEALTH CARE EFFECTS IN CHILDHOOD ASTHMA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epidemiological studies have shown the importance of environmental risk factors and access to health care in childhood asthma health outcomes. Current knowledge suggests that both physical (e.g., exposure to a variety of allergens, toxins, and other factors, such as moisture, mold, and pollution) and social components (e.g., stress, family structure, and other poverty-related factors) contribute to disease etiology and expression. The proposed research builds on Dr. Lara's experience as Principal Investigator of the Allies Against Asthma in Puerto Rico demonstration project in the Luis Llorens Torres Residential Project in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This community - the largest low-cost housing project in the United States and the Caribbean - has a high- risk socio-demographic profile that can affect asthma: almost one-third of households are headed by unwed mothers; over half of residents have monthly incomes under $500; and unemployment and apathy toward educational activities is high. We propose to perform secondary analyses of a uniquely rich and existing geo-coded dataset for this Puerto Rico study, to meet the following specific aims: (1) to explore the risk factors associated with asthma prevalence, and poor symptom control and quality of life in this population, including individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics of the social environment (e.g., health care access, crime exposure) and physical environment (e.g., smoking in the household, outdoor pollution); (2) to determine whether geographic clusters of high asthma prevalence and morbidity occur in the neighborhoods studied and, if so, whether social and physical neighborhood characteristics are associated with this clustering effect; and, (3) to determine if differences exist in the effectiveness of the Allies Against Asthma intervention across subsets of the studied population with different neighborhood social and physical environment characteristics. Forty to fifty percent of Island Puerto Rican children are estimated to have childhood asthma - the highest reported prevalence of asthma of all U.S. children. The proposed study provides a unique opportunity to better understand the factors contributing to the disproportionate burden of asthma this population experiences. Our dataset contains geo-coded information on site of residence and schooling of all study participants, as well as possible neighborhood physical and social environmental contextual factors that can contribute to this asthma disparity among Puerto Ricans. The study findings can also be highly relevant to interventions to reduce asthma disparities in other Hispanic and non-Hispanic high-risk children. Forty to fifty percent of Island Puerto Rican children are estimated to have childhood asthma - the highest reported prevalence of asthma of all U.S. children. The proposed study provides a unique opportunity to better understand how environmental factors and neighborhood characteristics contribute to the disproportionate burden of asthma this population experiences.          ",NEIGHBORHOOD & HEALTH CARE EFFECTS IN CHILDHOOD ASTHMA,7472284,R03HD051768,"['Crime ', ' Ally ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Caribbean natives ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Household Heads ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Site ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Allergens ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Island ', ' Learning ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Funding ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mothers ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Poverty ', ' Exposure to ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Molds ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Pollution ', ' Toxin ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States ', ' Wood material ', ' Wood ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' family structure ', ' Population Study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R03,2008,94091,0.3546386092554107
"Literacy and improving patient-clinician encounters for Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Low literacy is widespread and particularly prevalent among low-income and minority groups, the same groups in which asthma morbidity is excessive. Inattention by clinicians to the literacy and related health literacy of patients may result in ineffective communication and subsequent poor patient self-management. Some aspects of health literacy such as understanding numerical concepts may be particularly important. We recently developed and validated an asthma-specific numeracy questionnaire (ANQ). We found that many adults do not understand the numerical concepts embedded in standard asthma education. Those with low ANQ scores were also more likely to have had hospitalizations and ED visits for asthma. The initial aims of this application are to use the participants and outcomes of the parent R01 HL073932 to conduct a cohort study to examine the association of (Specific Aim 1) a standard health literacy instrument and (Specific   Aim 2) ANQ with adherence to inhaled steroids (measured electronically), asthma control (FEV1), and asthma-related quality of life in adults with moderate or severe asthma. The parent R01 HL073932 addresses another barrier to successful asthma care involving patient-clinician interaction. It is a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of a behavioral individualized intervention, problem-solving (PS) with standard asthma education (Attention Control (AC)), on these same outcomes. PS seeks to empower lowincome and minority asthmatic adults and allows clinicians to take account of the social context of these patients' lives. Exploratory Aim 3 will examine the interaction between literacy and PS versus AC interventions. We will use focus groups of patients and clinicians to refine the ANQ as a brief individualized assessment for clinicians. We will then develop and pilot an intervention to test whether ANQ-based individualized interventions result in improved adherence and asthma outcomes (Specific Aim 4). This will lead to subsequent research applications to test whether ANQ-based interventions alone or combined with   PS results in better asthma outcomes and adherence. That is, we anticipate that both PS and ANQ will lead to simple brief additive or synergistic ways for clinicians to assess patients and tailor information. My Overarching Research Goal is examine barriers to asthma care that operate at the interface between patient and clinician and that may differentially affect members of ethnic and racial minority groups with my ultimate goal being to design and implement ways to reduce such health disparities. This K02 application will allow me to continue along my current trajectory to become an independent investigator focusing on strategies directed at both clinicians and patients. By enhancing current collaborations, building others, and participating in relevant research working groups, I will create a team of expert collaborators in health and literacy, education, bioenqineerinq (directed at behavior measurement), and behavioral medicine        (End of Abstract)          ",Literacy and improving patient-clinician encounters for Asthma,7416773,K02HL088469,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Date/Time ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Electronics ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Monitor ', ' Rate ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Independent Living ', ' Inhalators ', ' Inhaler ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' literacy ', ' Living Wills ', ' living will ', ' Funding ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Motivation ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Powder dose form ', ' Powders ', ' Prednisone ', ' delta-Cortisone ', ' Prednisonum ', ' Metacortandracin ', ' Deltadehydrocortisone ', ' Deltacortisone ', ' Delta(1)-Cortisone ', ' Dehydrocortisone ', ' 17,21-dihydroxy-pregna-1,4-diene-3,11,20-trione ', ' 1, 2-Dehydrocortisone ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' instrument ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Steroids ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' inattention ', ' inattentiveness ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Week ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Score ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Visit ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1 ', ' PFT/FEV1 ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume 1 Test ', ' FEV1%VC ', ' FEV1 ', ' abstracting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Self Management ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight control ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Adult asthma ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' trial comparing ', ' pill (pharmacologic) ', ' Pill ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K02,2008,105219,0.21021921912792746
"PEDIATRIC ASTHMA DISPARITIES: PERCEPTIONS AND MANAGEMENT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Pediatric asthma, the most common chronic illness of childhood, is increasing in prevalence, morbidity and mortality : particularly in minority children.  This application seeks to establish the Rhode Island : Puerto Rico Asthma Center (RIPRAC) for reducing disparities in asthma among Latino children.  Brown University faculty involved with an extensive pediatric asthma research program will join with epidemiologists, clinicians, and health services researchers from the minority serving University of Puerto Rico to study potentially overlooked determinants of disparity.  An ambitious training component (based on a successful T32 research training program) will involve individuals from both sites at both sites.  The RIPRAC Research AIMS include four projects that seek to understand the causes of disparities at multiple levels : the biomedical, the individual/family, and the socioenvironmental level.  The four projects, respectively, will 1) examine discrepancies between the diagnosis of asthma as assessed by parental report, the primary care medical record and our systematic diagnosis base on the NHLBI guidelines; 2) assess characteristics (prescription practices, shared decision making, continuity and access to care) of the health care system that may differentially affect asthma morbidity; 3) evaluate family beliefs, the burden of asthma management and medication adherence as they affect asthma morbidity and health care utilization in Latino and Anglo children; and 4) study the relation of symptom perception to pediatric asthma discrepancies.  Subjects for all 4 projects will be the same 300 mainland Anglos, 200 mainland Latinos (of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent) and 400 island Puerto Rico children with asthma, aged 7-15, thereby promoting comparability and efficiency.  Chi-square analyses and ANOVA's will be used to assess differences between groups; techniques of logistic regression and multiple regression will be used to model the effects of covariates.  The RIPRAC Training component will provide clinical research education and supervision to Puerto Rican trainees and faculty, enhance cultural awareness of Brown personnel as it relates to asthma disparities, and launch at least three trainee-led pilot research projects in the area.

"Chicago Initiative to Raise Asthma Health Equity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Over the past decade there has been a heightened awareness of the disproportionate impact of asthma morbidity and mortality among African Americans and persons of lower social economic status. The causes underlying this disparity have not been fully elucidated. However, there is strong evidence that the level of social stress imposed by this condition and the degree of coping and self-management skills present are factors that may be particularly important in explaining these disparities. The purpose of this project is to develop a collaborative research program between Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Cook County Hospital to fully characterize the relationship of social stress, coping, and self-regulatory health behaviors in the context of asthma disparities among African American and low income populations. Once characterized, the project will then develop and test an intervention strategy to reduce asthma disparities in high-risk populations based on evidence-based models that have demonstrated success in social work, nursing, and community interventions. There are four research aims for this proposed Center of Excellence.      (1) To develop and validate culturally appropriate psychosocial instruments related to the underlying causes of disparity in asthma morbidity (2) To identify the structural relationships of psychosocial factors to other known influential factors related to disparities in asthma outcomes. (3) To study the changes in structural relationship among influential factors in asthma disparity over time as related to changes in health status.

"Early Environmental Hygiene and Pediatric Asthma The prevalence of asthma has increased over the 20th century in most, if not all, developed countries of the world. Major findings from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey and the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood were that asthma prevalence is increasing worldwide; is generally more common in Western countries; more prevalent in English-speaking countries; and increasing in developing countries as they become more Westernized or become urbanized. CDC estimated that from January to March of 2006 more than 22 million Americans (8.0%) suffered from asthma, an increase from 7.8% in 2005. While many studies have demonstrated strong inherited influences on the development of asthma, these changes have been too rapid to be explained solely by genetics, and it has been widely hypothesized that early life exposures influence an infant¿s susceptibility to asthma. In the US, asthma morbidity and mortality are highest among persons who are of minority status. One approach to reducing racial disparities involves targeting reductions in asthma incidence through modification of risk factors. The objective of this proposal is the epidemiological investigation of early life environmental factors, focusing on pet exposure and endotoxin, that may alter immunologic development, based on the premise that variations in the early immune response to environmental stimuli affects risk for asthma.The level of exposure of humans to animals (and presumably endotoxin) has declined over the last 100 years through urbanization and suburbanization, although humans have evolved with close contact with animals. As part of an ongoing study, the Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy & Asthma Longitudinal Study (WHEALS), a multi-ethnic cohort of pregnant women has been recruited for prospective study of their children. With this renewal, we will extend follow-up to 5-6 years of age for the 1248 children of varied racial backgrounds (60% Black). We will use the WHEALS cohort to 1) evaluate whether pet contact and household endotoxin levels affect total and allergen-specific IgE and extracellular cytokine (IL4, IL5, IL13, IFN?, IL2, IL12, TNF and IL10 production by stimulated T-cells) patterns measured at 4 points in time during infancy (birth, 6 months, 12 months and 2 years) and 2) how these exposures and immunological patterns are related to the prevalence of clinical asthma at age 5-6 years. Finally, the data will be analyzed to evaluate the role that Black race plays in the relationship between early environmental exposures and immunological biomarkers and asthma, after accounting for other non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors including CD14 genotype, family history, child sex, birth order, birth characteristics, socioeconomic status, and other social, behavioral and environmental variables. If factors associated with animal or endotoxin contact are related to asthma risk, such factors would likely lend themselves to public health interventions.

"COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP TO REDUCE ASTHMA DISPARITIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric asthma is increasingly common among minority children, and results in considerable healthcare disparity. This application seeks to establish a Community Partnership between Rhode Island Hospital and the Providence Community Health Centers to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to increase use of controller medications for asthma among Latino and African-American children. A Community Advisory Board of parents and key informants will provide ongoing input regarding treatment implementation. Families with children who have persistent asthma symptoms will be enrolled. Three groups will be recruited (N=240 total): African-American families, Latino families who prefer health care in Spanish, and Latino families who prefer health care in English. All families will be enrolled in a brief baseline period. Children who are prescribed oral or inhaled controller medications will have medication use monitored electronically. Research staff will also collect data regarding baseline medication use from pharmacy records and insurance claims. Asthma knowledge, medication beliefs, medication adherence, and asthma morbidity will be assessed at baseline, end of treatment, and at 3-month intervals until 1 year post-treatment. After completing a baseline, all families will attend a group-based asthma education class in their own Community Health Center (one of five CHC's). Families will the be randomized to one of two nurse delivered interventions, either 1) a Standard Care (SC) condition, which emphasizes use of symptom monitoring, peak flow meter, trigger control measures, and a written action plan, or 2) a Medication Adherence (MA) condition, which assesses use of alternative medications, addresses concerns regarding use of controller medications, and uses problem-solving techniques to address barriers to medication use. Follow-up is conducted by researcher assistants at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month time points post-intervention. It is expected that both interventions will increase asthma knowledge, but the MA intervention will yield greater controller medication use and decreased morbidity. It is further expected that differences in medication adherence post-treatment will be mediated by medication beliefs. Lastly, it is anticipated that within the Latino groups, Latinos with low English proficiency will demonstrate the greatest changes from baseline on medication adherence and morbidity. A Sustainability Advisory board will provide guidance regarding project implementation in the community beyond the life of the grant.               ",COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP TO REDUCE ASTHMA DISPARITIES,7371096,R01NR008524,"['Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Health behavior change ', ' treatment effect ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Electronics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Family ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Foundations ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Insurance ', ' Language ', ' African ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Nurses ', ' Parents ', ' Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Writing ', ' Oral ', ' Techniques ', ' Class ', ' meter ', ' Belief ', ' preference ', ' nursing intervention ', ' skills ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Problem Solving ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Condition ', ' ']",NINR,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2008,211453,0.17557440466620072
"Faculty to Enhance Technology-Based Adolescent Asthma Health Disparity Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Pediatric Prevention Research Center, a Division of the Department of Pediatrics at Wayne State University (WSU), is a multidsicplinary group of faculty with a focus on behavioral interventions to reduce pediatric health disparities nationally and internationally. These efforts have included a focus on NHLBI diseases such as obesity and asthma in African American youth. Asthma exerts a high toll on minority children living in inner-city communities, especially adolescents. African-American adolescents not only have higher rates of asthma, but also experience more emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and fatalities from asthma than Caucasian adolescents. One factor that can account for mortality/morbidity in pediatric asthma is poor asthma management. Recently, several faculty have utilized technology to develop behavioral interventions to improve illness management for youth with HIV and diabetes. This RFA will allow Dr. Karen Kolmodin to transition to independent faculty status by September 1 with a focus on expanding technology based behavioral interventions to youth with asthma. This RFA fills a critical need to train the next generation of pediatric health disparity researchers. WSU is in a unique position to fill this need as we are located in Detroit, a city with the highest percentage of African Americans of major U.S. city (Census, 2000). The proposal has the potential to pave the way for continued hiring of workers in new technology based areas that are diversified from the beleaguered automotive industry as pilot projects give way to larger extramurally funded proposals. This proposal will create a synergy between a researcher transitioning to independent tenure-track faculty status and a division focused on reducing pediatric health disparities (""CORE CENTER"") to move the health disparities field fonward in the area of technology-based behavioral interventions to improve asthma management among minority adolescents and young adults.      This proposal will create a synergy between a researcher transitioning to independent tenure-track faculty status and a division focused on reducing pediatric health disparities (""CORE CENTER"") to move the health disparities field fon/vard in the area of technology-based behavioral interventions to improve asthma management among minority adolescents and young adults.             ",Faculty to Enhance Technology-Based Adolescent Asthma Health Disparity Research,7858971,P30HL101301,"['Crime ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Faculty ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' base ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Heart ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Industry ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Mexican ', ' Funding ', ' Marketing ', ' Michigan ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Arabs ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Schools ', ' Life ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Caucasians ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Award ', ' Country ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' pediatric department ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Budgets ', ' Prevention Research ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Censuses ', ' Economic Recession ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Cities ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Foreclosure ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' ']",NHLBI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,P30,2009,333796,0.2933498141407843

"Development of a Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite higher levels of morbidity and mortality, African American children receive asthma care that is less consistent with national asthma guideline recommendations compared to white children. Access to care, insurance status and socioeconomic status have not fully explained these disparities. Poor assessments of asthma morbidity and suboptimal communication between physicians and parents of inner-city children with asthma may contribute racial disparities in quality of asthma care. We propose to examine the effects of an asthma-focused communication intervention on parent-physician communication and quality of asthma care among inner-city African American children. The objective of this project is to design, validate and implement an effective Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument (P-ACCI) within an innercity- based, university pediatric clinic. We therefore propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To develop and validate a simple, paper-and-pencil pediatric asthma control and communication instrument (P-ACCI) to serve as a both a prompt and a communication aide for the physician and the parent to discuss issues of asthma health; 2) To conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial in a primary care pediatric setting of inner-city African American children with asthma in order to assess the effects of the P-ACCI on the quality of patientphysician communication and quality of asthma care. We hypothesize that: 1) the P-ACCI is a valid measure of asthma morbidity; 2) regular use of the P-ACCI will improve the quality of parent-physician communication and the quality of asthma care for children. Relevance: There is a pressing need for simple, low-cost clinical strategies applicable in diverse settings to improve communication about variables important to asthma management. Such strategies would enhance clinical judgment, decision-making, and quality of asthma care. The current study will evaluate a novel, lowcost tool with the potential to reduce asthma care disparities related to poor parent-physician communication My career goals involve becoming a successful investigator of racial disparities in quality of asthma care, and to become a Professor of Pediatrics who develops remedies to improve asthma care through a multidisciplinary research center, and to reduce racial disparities in asthma care and asthma outcomes.

"Reducing Asthma Disparities: The Baltimore City Healthy Homes Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract ""Reducing Asthma Disparities: The Baltimore City Healthy Homes Initiative"" (RAD) will reduce racial disparities in asthma morbidity in Baltimore by providing an evidence- based healthy homes intervention to the families of 250 Baltimore Public School students aged 4-18 who have persistent asthma. The RAD Initiative is a translation research project, adapting the effective Seattle-King County (SKC) model. The SKC Healthy Homes program has significantly reduced asthma symptom days and urgent health service usage (Krieger et al., 2005). We will enhance the SKC intervention to address risks specific to Baltimore through: 1) maternal depression screening and referrals, 2) strengthened rodent reduction measures, 3) lead poisoning prevention, 4) additional injury prevention, 5) motivational interviewing to reduce environmental tobacco smoke, and 6) recruitment through the schools. This translation research will compare and contrast the intervention costs, medical costs, home environmental health outcomes and children's asthma-related health outcomes in 250 intervention children and a comparable group of 250 non-intervention Medicaid enrolled children with persistent asthma. The RAD Initiative will be lead by the Baltimore City Health Department's Healthy Homes Division, whose mission is to improve the health of children and their families by reducing housing hazards tied to asthma, lead exposure, and injuries. In addition to helping the BCHD achieve its long-term goal of reducing asthma disparities, the RAD Initiative's specific aims include, first, disseminating project findings broadly to city, state, and national stakeholders through a Baltimore community conference, student-produced video, journal articles, community and conference presentations, and web-based information and materials. Second, the RAD Initiative will identify mechanisms by which the program can be sustained over time and scaled up to address the needs of all at-risk Baltimore families of children with asthma. Third, the RAD Initiative aims to use a coordinated, public-private partnership approach to extend the reach of healthy homes home visiting programs. The RAD Initiative represents the alliance of two universities, two city agencies, the state, Baltimore City's congressional delegation, a youth-focused social action organization, an asthma coalition, and a coalition of African-American charities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Project Narrative By adapting the Seattle King County Healthy Homes approach to the Baltimore environment and new research findings, we aim to reduce disparities related to childhood asthma, lead poisoning, and injuries. Baltimore's unsafe housing is harmful to the city's most vulnerable residents.

"A Patient Advocate and Literacy-Based Treatment of Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05), Comparative Effectiveness Research, and Specific Challenge Topic 05-MD105, Health Literacy. Half of US adults have no more than basic reading and numerical skills; inadequate health literacy is a consequence. It is associated with unsatisfactory patient-provider communication and poor health outcomes in chronic diseases including asthma. We found low numeracy to be associated with prior ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma and determined that numerical skill may attenuate the association of minority status with lower asthma-related quality of life. We propose a Patient Advocate Intervention (PAI) as the most practical immediate but sustainable method of achieving effective health literacy (EHL) (understanding of asthma management and the practice/health system). Adapted from the Patient Navigator of Harold P. Freeman, MD and informed by focus groups of asthma patients, the PAI addresses low literacy, facilitating patient-provider communication surrounding self-management and navigation of the practice and health system to ensure medical recommendations can be accomplished. The PA is a nonprofessional with guidance from a social worker who will assist with and model preparations for a visit with the asthma doctor, attend the visit, and afterwards confirm understanding as well as facilitate scheduling, obtaining insurance coverage, and overcoming other barriers to carrying out medical advice. The primary outcome is electronically-monitored use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the treatment of choice for all but the mildest asthma. ICS use is a marker of successful patient-provider communication. Other outcomes are asthma-related: hospitalizations, ED visits, change in FEV1, and asthma-related quality of life. We hypothesize that the PAI will improve these outcomes by promoting EHL. We will enroll 84 adults with a high prevalence of low numerical skills who are approximately 67% black and 10% Latino with moderate or severe asthma to carry out the following Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: refine and evaluate the feasibility of PAI and Specific Aim 2: conduct a randomized comparison of PAI with standard asthma education to obtain effect size estimates for ICS adherence and asthma-related outcomes for a future R01 confirmatory randomized trial of the final version of PAI. Exploratory analyses will assess EHL as a mediator, various moderators, and estimate the incremental costs of PAI. This novel project fills several research gaps. It 1) compares and tests an intervention addressing literacy to improve health, one that can easily be incorporated into practice to better patient self-management and preventive care, 2) is a potentially long-lasting intervention which will benefit all patients, especially those with low health literacy, and 3) will potentially improve prevention of asthma exacerbations, reducing the need for ED use. It fulfills ARRA goals by creating or retaining partial or complete funding for 16 area jobs. Half of US adults have no more than basic reading and numerical skills. A consequence is inadequate health literacy, which is associated with unsatisfactory patient-provider communication and poor health outcomes in chronic diseases, including asthma. We have adapted a patient navigator intervention to address asthma in high risk communities as a practical, immediate, and sustainable method of achieving effective health literacy in patients low health literacy. This intervention will lead to improved adherence and asthma control, attenuating health disparities so marked in asthma. It is compared for efficacy and cost-effectiveness with asthma education.

"Using a Novel Technology to Improve Adherence: School-Based Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, and specific Challenge Topic, 06-OD(OBSSR)-101*: Using new technologies to improve or measure adherence. We propose the development and testing of a novel technology to improve adherence to effective preventive asthma medications and reduce morbidity among young urban children. While NHLBI guidelines recommend daily maintenance medications for all children with persistent asthma, studies indicate that poor adherence is common, and many children in the US who should receive preventive medications are not receiving them. The goal of this new translational project is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing directly observed therapy of preventive asthma medications in school in a real-world setting, using state-of-the-art web-based technology for systematic screening, electronic report generation, and communication between nurses, caregivers, and primary care providers. This study builds on our experience with a prior study of 530 children that demonstrated that school-based administration of preventive asthma medications improves asthma symptoms and reduces absenteeism. In order for this program to have sustainable public health impact, we must now develop the technology for systematic screening and communication in order to integrate it within the school and community systems that serve these high risk children. We propose a two-year study to develop an integrated system for the sustained delivery of preventive asthma medications in schools using web-based technology (year 1), and to conduct a pilot randomized trial to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of the intervention on asthma morbidity, including symptom-free days, quality of life, absenteeism, and urgent health care use (year 2). We also will evaluate the added cost to implement and sustain this new system of care. In the first year, we will develop the technology for this new system of care and refine the intervention using expert consultation with key informants and focus group methodology. The second year will consist of a randomized trial to test this model of care with 80 students from 12 inner-city schools. We hypothesize that this novel adaptation of school-based asthma care will; 1) be feasible and acceptable among this population and among school and community personnel, and 2) yield reduced asthma morbidity (symptom-free days, absenteeism, and emergency room / urgent care use for asthma care). There currently are no practical, system-wide interventions for urban children with asthma that assure that children take the medications they should be receiving. The proposed intervention could have a major public health impact as a model for asthma care in communities nationwide to improve outcomes and reduce disparities. Further, it provides the opportunity to substantially accelerate the diffusion of a novel method to improve adherence and subsequently reduce morbidity, without interruption of a highly successful community-based collaboration. - RELEVANCE  There currently are no practical, system-wide interventions for urban children with asthma that assure that children are receiving appropriate preventive care. Importantly, effective asthma therapies will not work if they are not used by the patients who need them. This intervention is designed to implement guideline- based asthma care through an innovative program in the city schools. This project may have a profound impact on public health because it presents a practical system change utilizing technology to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines. Our prior data suggest that the proposed school-based asthma intervention could produce significant reduction in morbidity for minimum cost. This program has the potential to serve as a model for improved asthma care in urban communities nationwide.              NARRATIVE - RELEVANCE There currently are no practical, system-wide interventions for urban children with asthma that assure that children are receiving appropriate preventive care.

"Leukotriene Receptor Gene Variation and Atopic Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atopic asthma is a significant economic and public health problem in the world. The pathway of inflammation leading to atopic asthma is a complex process that includes leukotrienes, leukotriene receptors, eosinophils, and Immunoglobulin E (IgE). Evidence also indicates that over 50% of asthma cases are attributed to atopy and that this percentage is higher in males than females. The rate of asthma is increasing in children. Current treatment modalities are unable to adequately control atopic asthma in all patients. Evidence suggests that genetic variation in leukotriene receptors (CYSTLR1 and CYSTLR2) play a role in the expression of inflammation in atopic disease, airway dysfunction and remodeling in asthma, but most of these findings come from studies of homogenous populations outside the United States. To address this gap in knowledge, this genetic epidemiological research study program will explore whether CYSLTR1 and CYSLTR2 gene variations are associated with inflammatory markers of atopy, with atopic asthma, and with gender utilizing a candidate gene association approach of participants already enrolled in the longitudinal Tucson Epidemiological Study of Airway Obstructive Disease (TESAOD) program. TESAOD is comprised of 13 similar surveys and questionnaires including demographic, disease status, medication use, laboratory test results, pulmonary test results, and other biomarkers. The proposed study will include both secondary analysis of information from TESAOD as well as primary data collection of genetic variations through Taqman allele discrimination from extracted DNA from these participants. This traineeship and research is an opportunity to work with the principal investigator in TESAOD and a unique opportunity to research genetic variations in atopic asthma of up to 1,000 U.S. Caucasian participants enrolled in TESAOD. Applicant, sponsor, and co-sponsor are an excellent match for this study of atopic asthma, inflammation, and genetic variations. This research is in alignment with the National Institute of Health goal of fostering fundamental creative discoveries that extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. The goal of this research study and applicant's long term goal are also aligned with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Healthy People 2010 goal for respiratory disease to promote respiratory health through better prevention, detection, treatment, and education efforts.       Understanding the pathology and genetic etiology of atopic asthma through this research will help translate genomic research from bench to bedside and contribute to innovative tailored preventive strategies, diagnostic tools, and therapies for those suffering from atopic asthma.

"Comparison of Asthma Programs for Schools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Comparison of Asthma Programs for Schools (CAPS) study is to evaluate efficacy of a new developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling asthma health education program compared to a low-dose control, well-established, non-academic program. The new program for diverse fifth- grade students with asthma and their family caregivers is entitled, ""Staying Healthy Asthma Responsible & Prepared"" (SHARP). SHARP is a comprehensive, theory-driven, evidenced-guided program developed in collaboration with school personnel and members of one community asthma coalition that has two components: (a) a Student Component and (b) Community Component. The low-dose comparison group will receive Open Airways for Schools (OAS) that is widely disseminated through the American Lung Association. Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of SHARP compared to the low-dose OAS control group for fifth-grade students on cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral aspects of asthma management immediately post- and at 12 and 24 months post-intervention. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the long-term effect of SHARP compared to the low-dose OAS control group for fifth-grade students on condition characteristics, use of healthcare services, and quality of life at 12 and 24 months post intervention. A two-group, longitudinal, prospective, cluster- randomized, single-blinded trial will be used. Schools will be matched based on fifth-grade enrollment numbers, standardized reading and math scores, free/reduced lunch eligibility, and racial/ethnic proportions prior to randomization. The unit of analysis will be the student. The sample will consist of 2 cohorts of fifth- grade students, ages 9-12 years, with asthma and their caregivers. Two cohorts of student/caregiver dyads will be recruited over 2 years (N=152 dyads per year for a total of 304 dyads over two years) and analyzed separately. A minimum of 5-6 dyads will be recruited from 30 elementary schools located in three communities with 10 schools selected from each community. Participants will represent varying socioeconomic, cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. Recently retired certified elementary schoolteachers identified by the areas' school districts will be trained to serve as interveners to deliver SHARP or OAS during school hours. Evaluators will collect pre- and post-intervention data from dyads in the home using audio-linked data entry systems loaded on laptop computers at four time points. A bi-monthly automated voice recorded telephone survey will be placed to caregivers to monitor symptom days, medication use, use of healthcare services, and school absenteeism. To adjust for non-independence of observations within schools, hypotheses will be tested using the generalized estimating equations approach for categorical or ordinal variables and linear mixed models for continuous outcomes. After efficacy is demonstrated, this study would advance scientific knowledge through the offering of a comprehensive, developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling education program for older school age students with asthma that is not currently available. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nine million U.S. children under 18 years of age have been diagnosed with asthma at some point in their lives and approximately 4 million children have had an asthma episode in the last 12 months. This project seeks to compare efficacy of two school-based asthma education programs for fifth-grade students with asthma aimed at improving cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes; decreasing severity of illness; and improving quality of life. After efficacy is demonstrated, this study would advance scientific knowledge through the offering of a comprehensive, developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling education program for older school age students with asthma that is not currently available.             ",Comparison of Asthma Programs for Schools,7683797,R01NR010544,"['Counseling ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' American Lung Association ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Extended Family ', ' Behavioral ', ' Guidelines ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Hospitals ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Link ', ' Inhalators ', ' Inhaler ', ' Training ', ' Laws ', ' post intervention ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Fostering ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Single-Blind Study ', ' single-blind trial ', ' Michigan ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reading ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Sports ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Voice ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' respiratory ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Equation ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' laptop ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' fifth grade ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Friends ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Absenteeism ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' junior high school ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' comparison group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' prospective ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2009,417446,0.3960257574530354
"Racial/ethnic differences in symptom perception in childhood asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The greatest racial/ethnic disparity in pediatric asthma exists between the two largest Latino ethnic groups in the United States. Puerto Rican children have the highest asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality rates, and Mexican-American children have the lowest rates. African-American children are also disproportionately affected by asthma and have high levels of morbidity. Identification of mechanisms that may contribute to these disparities is a critical goal for asthma research. At the present time, there is a surprising gap in the literature regarding children's asthma symptom perception accuracy among specific racial/ethnic groups. Additionally, little is known about how racial/ethnic differences in parental beliefs and mental health may affect children's symptom perception and asthma morbidity. The research plan will involve a cross-sectional comparison of 40 African-American, 40 Puerto Rican, and 40 Mexican-American children with asthma between ages 7-11 and their primary caregivers. Families will be recruited from two city hospitals that predominantly serve families of low SES in the Bronx, NY. The study will involve a baseline session followed by 5 weeks of monitoring of children's asthma symptom perception ability and use of asthma medications in naturalistic settings. A second testing session will occur at a 5-week follow- up. Parent measures will include asthma beliefs, family support, acculturation, and assessment of major depression and abridged somatization using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Child measures will include depression, somatization, emotions during asthma attacks, and acculturation. Dependent measures will include use of PRN medication, functional morbidity, and asthma-related emergency room visits. Groups will be matched on clinician-rated asthma severity documented in medical charts. The primary aims of this small grant are to: a) examine children's asthma symptom perception and PRN medication use among African-American, Puerto Rican, and Mexican-American children, and b) compare parents' mental health, health beliefs, and family support across racial/ethnic groups, and c) examine the relationship between parents' level of acculturation and children's asthma symptom perception and morbidity among Puerto Rican and Mexican-American families. An exploratory aim is to examine whether pathways involving children's psychological symptoms, children's asthma symptom perception, and parent factors mediate racial/ethnic differences on PRN medication use and asthma morbidity. This study is designed to identify parent and child factors that may contribute to asthma morbidity and symptom perception in a differential manner among African-American, Puerto Rican, and Mexican-American children. The long-term objective of this research program is the development of culturally sensitive family interventions designed to reduce asthma morbidity and hence, disparities among ethnic minority children. This research will help support the NIH mission to reduce health disparities by focusing on asthma among inner-city, ethnic minority children. Examining behavioral predictors of disparities among African-American, Puerto Rican, and Mexican-American families may help inform culturally sensitive guidelines for provider care and family management of asthma.          ",Racial/ethnic differences in symptom perception in childhood asthma,7663154,R03HD053355,"['Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emotions ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' International ', ' Subgroup ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Guidelines ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Interview ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mission ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' New York ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' United States ', ' Severities ', ' Side ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Belief ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' family management ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' family influence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' depression ', ' ']",NICHD,YESHIVA UNIVERSITY,R03,2009,83000,0.37640657795929894
"NIH Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under the leadership of its current Commissioner, John Auerbach, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has identified the elimination of racial and ethnic disparities in health as one of its most important priorities. The proposed Reducing Environmental Asthma Disparities in Youth (READY) study reflects the Department's mission and priorities. The proposed READY study will examine how race, ethnicity, country of origin of parents, language, socioeconomic status, insurance status and education level of parents will influence the ability of the intervention to reduce health disparities. The study will enroll 400 low-income families with children ages 2-11 years with diagnosed asthma for a one-year home-visiting intervention implemented by community health workers. Participants will be patients at one of four clinical sites - a hospital- based asthma clinic in Boston with a predominantly African-American population, a neighborhood health center in Boston with a predominantly Caribbean/Haitian population born outside the US, a large community health center in the city of Lawrence, Massachusetts, serving a predominantly Hispanic population and a large non- profit, multi-specialty medical group practice in Boston serving white and minority patients with both private and public insurance. The study hypothesis is that the combination of two proven interventions - the Seattle Healthy Homes model, which addresses substandard housing conditions that exacerbate asthma, and the Wee Wheezers education curriculum, which improves parent understanding of asthma and raise parental expectations - together will reduce disparities in asthma symptom control for children ages 2 to 11 years among racial and ethnic minorities, and can be adopted in different health care settings for different racial and ethnic populations. Community Health Workers (CHWs) will ensure that the interventions are effectively deployed and will facilitate communication between patients and providers. The proposed study has three specific aims: 1) The READY intervention will reduce racial and ethnic disparities in substandard housing conditions that exacerbate asthma, such as pest infestations and mold exposure and improve parental understanding in the importance of reducing asthma triggers; 2) The READY intervention will reduce racial and ethnic disparities in parental expectations of asthma control and improve concordance between health care provider and parental reports of asthma control for better communication in asthma management; and 3) The READY intervention will reduce racial and ethnic disparities in asthma morbidity and disability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Reducing Environmental Asthma Disparities in Youth study will examine significant pediatric asthma disparities by race, ethnicity and income and the contribution of differing environmental exposures, particularly substandard housing which is commonly found in neighborhoods where children from low income and racial and ethnic minority populations live.           Project Narrative The proposed Reducing Environmental Asthma Disparities in Youth study will examine significant pediatric asthma disparities by race, ethnicity and income and the contribution of differing environmental exposures, particularly substandard housing which is commonly found in neighborhoods where children from low income and racial and ethnic minority populations live.",NIH Health Disparities,7691563,R01ES017407,"['Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Provider ', ' Juniper ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Low Literacy Population ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Foundations ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Group Practice ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hospitals ', ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Housing ', ' Site ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Leadership ', ' Individual ', ' Parenting Education ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Americas ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity -

"Whole Genome Analyses for Asthma in Latino Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, asthma prevalence is highest in Puerto Ricans (26%) and lowest in Mexicans (10%). This is paradoxical since both groups are considered ""Hispanic"" or ""Latino"". Although there are many potential explanations for this observation, including environmental and socioeconomic factors, one potential explanation is that the genetic predisposition to asthma differs among subgroups within the Latino population. Latinos are admixed and share varying proportions of African, Native American and European ancestry. The mixed ancestry of Latinos provides unique opportunities in epidemiological and genetic studies and may be useful in untangling complex gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in disease susceptibility. This proposal will take advantage of clinical data and genomic DNA on 2,100 Puerto Rican and 1,500 Mexican asthma cases and controls collected as part of two large studies of asthma in Latinos (GALA 1 and GALA 2). The goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide association analyses to identify genetic factors associated with asthma and related phenotypes in Puerto Ricans and Mexicans. In addition, potential interactions between these genetic factors and other genes and environmental variables will be investigated. Specifically, we will: 1) genotype Puerto Rican and Mexican asthma cases and controls using the Affymetrix state-of-art 500K GeneChip arrays, 2) perform genome-wide association analysis on 500K GeneChip data to identify SNPs associated with asthma, asthma severity and bronchodilator response. The analysis will include clinical and demographic characteristics, environmental factors and individual admixture estimates to correct for potential confounders. In addition, admixture mapping analysis will be performed to complement the genome-wide association analysis. Admixture mapping may identify novel regions that harbor racial/ethnic specific alleles for asthma and related phenotypes; and 3) fine map SNPs significantly associated with asthma and related phenotypes in genome-wide analyses (initial-hit SNPs). To our knowledge this is the first proposal to perform a genome-wide association analysis for asthma and related phenotypes in Latinos. Due to the size and scope of this project, the results of this study should substantially increase our understanding of the etiology of asthma and drug response.

"Asthma Disparities in Latino Children:Acculturation,Illness Representations & CAM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethnic disparities in asthma health outcomes among Latino children are so striking that researchers and public health officials have issued a call for action to understand why this is occurring. Recent descriptive asthma research confirmed that these disparities are not totally explained by genetic, environmental, healthcare system or provider factors. Little research has been conducted integrating, in one explanatory model, the multitude of factors that lead to disparities. Perhaps of importance, but not well examined, is the role that illness representations (the way one interprets health and illness that influences management of health problems) may play in parents' decisions to use CAM and controller medications to manage their children's asthma. Parents are the gatekeepers for their children's healthcare and ultimately make the final treatment decisions. Before developing interventions targeting asthma health disparities, a more thorough understanding of the interaction of individual, cultural, experiential, and healthcare system factors and the social-environmental context is needed. The proposed study moves the research from descriptive studies to a multi-level examination of the interaction of social, cultural, experiential, environmental, and healthcare system factors on disparities in asthma control among Mexican and Puerto Rican children. The aims of this study are 1) to explore differences in illness representations between these Latino subgroups due to social and contextual factors, and 2) to test a growth model examining disparities in asthma control as a function of differences in parents' treatment decisions (CAM and controller medication use) and changes in illness representations over one year. This will be a one-year longitudinal, multi-site study of parental illness representations and CAM and controller medication use among a sample of 300 Latino (primarily Mexican and Puerto Rican) parents and children aged 5-12 who have asthma. Interviews and child assessments will be conducted with parents and children at enrollment, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment. This assessment schedule allows us to capture seasonal variations in the children's asthma symptoms as well as conform to the recommendation that children on daily controller medications have follow-up visits every 3 months. We will obtain spirometry measures from the children, and review children's medical records. To ensure diverse representation of Latino families and healthcare settings, the sample will be recruited from two community school-based health clinics and one clinical practice site in Phoenix, AZ, and two inner-city hospital asthma clinics in Bronx, NY. A multisite study is warranted because neither site alone has sufficient numbers of both Mexican and Puerto Rican families to conduct this research independently. It is preferable that interviews and assessments be conducted simultaneously among these two populations to minimize seasonal variations in asthma symptom control and to maximize standardization of administration of the surveys across time and samples. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ethnic disparities in childhood asthma outcomes between Mexican and Puerto Rican children asthma outcomes are so striking that researchers and public health officials have issued a call for action to understand why this is occurring. The factors leading to asthma health disparities between Mexican and Puerto Rican children are complex, yet little research has been conducted integrating, in one explanatory model, the multitude of factors that can lead to these disparities. The proposed study moves the research from descriptive studies of individual constructs and contexts to testing an integrated, multi-factorial model. The innovation of this project lies in the multi-level examination of co-varying influences (socio-demographic, cultural, experiential, environmental, and healthcare system) on disparities in asthma control among a sample of 300 Mexican and Puerto Rican children and their parents over a one year period.           Project Narrative  Ethnic disparities in childhood asthma outcomes between Mexican and Puerto Rican children asthma outcomes are so striking that researchers and public health officials have issued a call for action to understand why this is occurring.The factors leading to asthma health disparities between Mexican and Puerto Rican children are complex, yet little research has been conducted integrating, in one explanatory model, the multitude of factors that can lead to these disparities.

The innovation of this project lies in the multi-level examination of covarying influences (sociodemographic, cultural, experiential, environmental, and healthcare system) on disparities in asthma control among a sample of 300 Mexican and Puerto Rican children and their parents over a one year period.","Asthma Disparities in Latino Children:Acculturation,Illness Representations & CAM",7690412,R01AT005216,"['Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Medical Records ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Parental Ages ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Seasonal Variations ', ' Seasonal Cycle ', ' Sick Role ', ' Illness Behavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Spirometry ', ' Standardization ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' United States ', ' Wheezing ', ' wheeze ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Belief ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Leukotriene Antagonists ', ' Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' member ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Schedule ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' parental influence ', ' parent influence ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' child poverty ', ' clinical practice ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Cultural Characteristics ', ' Provider ', ' Complementary and alternative medicine ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Belief System ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' ']",NCCIH,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2009,570971,0.3263472216846927
"AsthmaNet:  Phenotypic Influences on Asthma Treatments     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Pittsburgh AsthmaNet proposal includes 3 protocols, with a 4th mechanistic protocol built around unmet asthma needs and phenotyping. These protocols should contribute to understanding asthma phenotypes in relation to mechanisms and specific treatment, particularly in relation to health disparities and contributions from race, socioeconomic status (SES) and asthma severity. These protocols build on our inherent expertise in asthma phenotyping and biology, racial/ethnic/socioeconomic issues, environmental effects, particularly in relation to underserved populations, psychosocial stress, and severe asthma. Our proposal includes participation from the Center for Minority Health with expertise in outreach in minority populations, a partner at Rainbow Babies of Case Western Reserve and a satellite at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. The 1st clinical trial will compare two approved drugs for treatment of the adult onset asthma phenotype, which hypothesizes that a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor will be more effective than a leukotriene receptor antagonist. The 2nd study evaluates the role of race in relation to SES on corticosteroid (CS) responses in children, h3TJ0thesizing that the African-American asthma phenotype, with and without regard to SES, predicts a poor response to inhaled CSs in asthmatic children. Vitamin D supplementation will overcome the poor response and improve outcomes. We will recruit African American and Caucasian children stratified by race and SES. Children who remain symptomatic following initial stabilization will be treated with high dose ICS and response determined. Children of all groups who do not improve will be randomized to treatment with Vitamin D or higher ICS dose to determine whether Vitamin D + lower dose ICS improves exacerbations and CS responsiveness better or to the same degree than the higher dose ICS. The mechanistic ancillary protocol will address whether aspects of CS unresponsiveness can be modeled in vitro, including effects of race/SES factors on cytokine suppression and histones, and the effect of Vitamin D to improve them. Finally, the severe asthma protocol will focus on the mast cell, specifically prostaglandin D2 and its interaction with CRTH2. We believe these studies address unmet needs in asthma and will improve its therapy.           ",AsthmaNet:  Phenotypic Influences on Asthma Treatments,7767286,U10HL098177,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Leukotriene E4 ', ' Leukotriene E-4 ', ' LTE4 ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Eicosanoids ', ' Address ', ' Enzymes ', ' Dose ', ' eosinophil ', ' eosinocyte ', ' Marrow Eosinophil ', ' Eosinophilic Leukocyte ', ' Eosinophilic Granulocyte ', ' Blood Eosinophil ', ' Acidophilic Leukocyte ', ' Cytokine Suppression ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Supplementation ', ' in vitro Model ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' minority health ', ' Histones ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Leukotrienes ', ' Leukotriene B4 ', ' Leukotriene B-4 ', ' LTB4 ', ' Liver Function Tests ', ' Inflammation Mediators ', ' inflammatory mediator ', ' Agonist ', ' mast cell ', ' mastocyte ', ' Tissue Basophils ', ' Marrow Mast Cell ', ' Basophilic Histiocyte ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' neutrophil ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Polymorph ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Heterophil Granulocyte ', ' Blood Segmented Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' montelukast ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Prostaglandin D2 ', ' Prosta-5,13-dien-1-oic acid, 9,15-dihydroxy-11-oxo-, (5Z,9alpha,13E,15S)- ', ' PGD2 ', ' 11-Dehydroprostaglandin F2alpha ', ' 11-Dehydroprostaglandin F2 alpha ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase ', ' Leukotriene A4 Synthetase ', ' Leukotriene A4 Synthase ', ' Leukotriene A Synthase ', ' LTA4 Synthase ', ' Arachidonic Acid 5-Lipoxygenase ', ' 5-Lipoxygenase ', ' programs ', ' Sputum ', ' Time ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Aspirin ', ' Measurin ', ' Extren ', ' Entericin ', ' Empirin ', ' Ecotrin ', ' Aspergum ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' 2-(Acetyloxy)benzoic Acid ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Universities ', ' Upper Respiratory Infections ', ' Upper Respiratory Tract Infection ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Biology ', ' Leukotriene Antagonists ', ' Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' Bronchodilator Agents ', ' lumen dilator ', ' Bronchodilators ', ' Bronchial-Dilating Agents ', ' outreach ', ' Allergic ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Zileuton ', ' N-(1-benzo(b)thien-2-ylethyl)-N-hydroxyurea ', ' Lipoxygenase Inhibitors ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' response ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' chronic rhinosinusitis ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' response marker ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U10,2009,529541,0.312300766736389
"Multisystemic therapy to reduce health disparities in adolescents with asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common cause of hospitalization in children other than infections. The Health People 2000 initiative to reduce asthma hospitalizations was NOT met. Minority, inner city children, particularly adolescents, appear to be most at risk for high morbidity and mortality. Poor illness management is thought to be a primary driver of asthma morbidity and mortality. Yet, there are very few randomized controlled trials with inner city adolescents with asthma. Because of the complexity of asthma management and the associated barriers, intensive, multi-component interventions are needed to improve outcomes among those at highest risk. The investigators have adapted Multisystemic Therapy (MST), an innovative home- and community-based psychotherapy, to successfully improve treatment adherence and outcomes in urban pediatric medical populations. The objective of the present study is to utilize MST to improve asthma management and to reduce health care utilization (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) among high risk African American adolescents (ages 12-16) with moderate to severe persistent asthma. High risk is defined as having >=2 emergency department visits or >= 1 hospitalizations in 12 months). Additional aims are to determine the stability of MST's effects over a 12 month interval and to determine cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Families will be recruited from the only university-affiliated medical center in Detroit, Michigan. Detroit has the highest percentage of African Americans of any major city in the United States. The experimental design for the proposed study is a randomized controlled trial with 170 high risk African American adolescents with moderate to severe persistent asthma, 85 of whom will receive standard multidisciplinary specialty care (control condition) and 85 of whom will receive this care plus MST. Families will complete an initial data collection session (baseline), a 7-month post-test designed to coincide with treatment completion, and a subsequent post-test at 12 months after baseline. If successful, this intervention will provide immediate assistance to a vulnerable population disproportionately affected by asthma and may reduce costs of care for this high risk population. While asthma is the second most common cause of hospitalization in children, minority, inner city teens are at increased risk for complications from the disease. We are testing the effectiveness of an intervention for inner city African American teens with asthma using Multisystemic Therapy an intensive, home- and community-based psychotherapy. If successful, this intervention will improve asthma management and overall health, as well as reduce healthcare costs for this vulnerable population disproportionately affected by asthma.

"Asthma Management and Ethnic Disparities at the Adolescent Transition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised K24 application proposes a mentorship program in patient-oriented research in pediatric asthma, with a specific focus on health care disparities and disease management behaviors. The K24 Candidate is an Associate Professor (Research) in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior of the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, with a history of funding in behavioral interventions to improve disease management and address health disparities in pediatric asthma. Training Plan: The candidate will obtain additional training in longitudinal data analysis, behavioral genetics, evaluation and assessment in health education, and health care access for Latino immigrants to enrich her skills and mentoring capacity in future health care disparities research. Research Plan: A longitudinal study of medication adherence for Latinos and non-Latino white (NLW) youth with asthma is proposed to assess the differential course of medication adherence by culture across the transition to adolescence. Three waves of 50 youth with persistent asthma (150 total, 25 Latino, 25 NLW in each wave) will complete a multimethod assessment of asthma status, family factors, medication beliefs, and controller medication use. Assessments will occur in eighth grade, then again in tenth grade, with continuous monitoring of medication adherence throughout. Analyses will evaluate the role of medication beliefs and family connectedness in supporting asthma management in Latino and NLW youth with persistent asthma, and assess differential trajectories of medication use by ethnic group over time. Mentoring Plan: The proposed mentoring plan offers participation in an RCT to address asthma disparities in medication use, access to an ongoing educational program for asthma that serves over 700 families a year, and an archival dataset that includes a wealth of data on disease management behavior in over 800 Latino and NLW children in Rl and Puerto Rico. An additional ongoing seminar is planned for junior faculty on topics such as recruiting and retaining culturally diverse samples, and preparing research grant applications.

"Asthma Disparities: Advancing Multilevel Causal Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Fifteen million Americans suffer from asthma, and the burden of morbidity appears to be rising. Asthma is also a major cause of health disparities among minority and low socio-economic groups. Yet the increasing prevalence and marked disparities in asthma remain largely unexplained by known risk factors, suggesting the potential role of community-level factors.  The aim of this application is to enable the candidate to undertake training and mentored research to address the question: what is the role of community and neighborhood-level processes in explaining the occurrence and distribution of asthma?     The candidate has expertise in multilevel statistical modeling with substantive interest in the social determinants of health. Over the next five years, the candidate will gain training in: (1) asthma epidemiology and pathophysiology, (2) the theory and measurement of neighborhood-level processes, and (3) causal inference within a multilevel framework.  Applying a multilevel approach that explicitly recognizes the embedding of asthma within its biologic, socioeconomic, environmental, and community contexts, the candidate will conduct mentored research to examine the causes of asthma disparities at different stages in the life-course.  The proposed analysis will be carried out within three ongoing studies (Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress; Boston Area Community Health Study; and Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods) in two American cities (Boston and Chicago). The research will examine the potential roles of neighborhood attributes such as structural disadvantage, collective psychosocial characteristics and physical environmental conditions in explaining the known disparities in the prevalence of asthma.  The proposed award will be used to develop an integrative and transdisciplinary approach to these issues, drawing on the rich resources available within Harvard University, including access to community-based study populations as well as to expertise from multiple fields.

"Intervention for Depressed Latina Mothers of Children with Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric asthma, the most common childhood chronic illness, remains a significant public health problem. Research indicates marked health care disparities in asthma, with Latino children at particular risk for poor health outcomes. Maternal depressive symptoms are also high among poor women who have children with asthma, and may compromise effective asthma management. The first AIM of this R21 application is to develop a manualized treatment to integrate asthma education with CBT strategies to reduce depressive symptoms among Latina mothers of children with persistent asthma. Such an intervention has the potential to improve asthma outcomes through increasing maternal knowledge and self-efficacy to manage asthma. During Year 1, Expert Consultants and an investigator team with expertise in asthma education, culturally tailored treatment, and CBT for Latinos will provide input into the development of the integrated intervention (MAADRE, for its acronym in Spanish). Focus groups will be conducted with our target population in Rhode Island and Puerto Rico to refine intervention content. Qualitative data analyses will be used to prioritize intervention targets and to identify contextual differences between Island and Mainland groups. The second AIM of this application is to conduct a small two-site pilot of the MAADRE intervention in Rhode Island and Puerto Rico. During Year 2, we will test the intervention with depressed mothers of children with asthma (32 in Puerto Rico and 32 in Rhode Island.) Mothers will be randomly assigned to receive either the MAADRE intervention or asthma education + child health (control). We expect that target children of participants in the MAADRE intervention will have improved asthma outcomes (asthma symptom days, lung function as measured by FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, asthma-related quality of life, and asthma control) relative to the control condition. We also anticipate that participants in the MAADRE intervention will have greater reduction in depressive symptoms and improved self-efficacy to manage asthma relative to the control condition. Findings from the proposed application will be used to design a larger RCT to evaluate the effects of the MAADRE intervention on asthma outcomes, and to compare cost-effectiveness of the intervention approaches.

"Multimedia Asthma Self-Management Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airway, affecting more than 20 million Americans. Without proper management it can be life-threatening. Children aged 0-17 have the highest prevalence of asthma, impacting an estimated 8.9 million children. Racial disparities exist in asthma prevalence for children; African- American children are (a) the most likely to suffer from asthma, (b) three times more likely to be hospitalized, and (c) four times more likely to die from asthma than Euro-American children. Children with asthma report higher incidences of asthma attacks, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations than adults; these are all indicators of uncontrolled asthma. Along with the burden of the disease, children with asthma are more likely to exhibit anxiety and stress disorders and have lower school performance than their non-asthmatic peers. Missed school and work days add to the financial burden of the disease for parents. The goal of this proposal is to create an asthma self-management skills training program for children and their parents in Internet/CD-ROM and DVD formats. This behaviorally based program will emphasize increasing: (a) knowledge regarding asthma and proper use of medications, (b) motivation to use prevention methods effectively, (c) self-efficacy in managing asthma, and (d) compliance with health care provider directions. Content will be based on clinical practice guidelines (NHLBI) and will include: (a) understanding asthma, (b) preventing asthma attacks, and (c) creating an asthma management plan. Materials in the child program will be tailored to the three largest racial/ethnic groups impacted by asthma (Euro-American, African- American and Hispanic) to increase relevance and efficacy, and intended for viewing with a parent. A separate and more detailed program for parents will be created with additional materials for schools and care providers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential benefits of this research to public health include improved understanding of cultural factors in pediatric asthma self-management, improved self-management skills for children, and better asthma management skills for their parents. This could result in eased suffering and improved quality of life for millions of children and their families, and also reduce the economic burden borne by society in the forms of medical expenditures and lost productivity.           PROJECT NARRATIVE  The potential benefits of this research to public health include improved understanding of cultural factors in pediatric asthma self-management, improved self-management skills for children, and better asthma management skills for their parents.

"Self-determination theory and caregiver smoking bans for asthmatic children    Description (provided by applicant): It is essential to know what motivates people to engage in health behaviors, especially when risks are great. Risks are great for children with asthma. Asthma is a chronic, debilitating, life-threatening, and costly disorder that disproportionately affects young, poor, and minority children, who must also rely on caregivers to meet their health care needs. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has created a strategic plan to address health disparities for asthma. In addition, the NHBLI coordinated an expert panel to develop national clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma. Despite these guidelines and advances in treatment, morbidity and mortality rates of pediatric asthma are not improving. Caregiver behavior may be a factor, particularly as it pertains to the control of asthma triggers like environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Self-determination theory (SDT) has been useful in predicting health behaviors in many contexts. According to SDT, persons persist in behaviors when they feel autonomously motivated (AM) for and perceive themselves to be competent (PC) about engaging in a particular behavior. Investigators have demonstrated that when clinicians support patients' autonomy and competence (are autonomy supportive; AS), behavior change is facilitated and health outcomes improved. SDT research to date, however, has focused on health behavior change for one's own sake (e.g. stopping smoking) while altruistic behavior change, for the primary benefit of others, has not been studied. Research to examine SDT as a theoretical framework consistent with the technique of motivational interviewing (Ml) is also new. Ml holds promise in assisting caregivers to adopt altruistic behaviors such as ETS control and is an intervention component of the larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) in which this cross-sectional, correlational study is nested. A sample of 304 caregivers of children with persistent asthma enrolled in a school-based medication program will be surveyed to address these specific aims: 1. To determine the role of AM and PC in predicting altruistic ETS control via caregiver smoking bans; 2. To describe the influence of autonomy support (AS) on SDT variables of behavior change for caregivers in the Ml intervention group; and 3. To determine the indirect relationships between AS, through AM and PC, and ETS control behavior among caregivers receiving Ml, if direct relationships are supported. Study findings will improve understanding of what motivates caregivers to keep smoke away from their children with asthma. This information will help to guide future research and interventions to reduce asthma burden, especially for families at greatest risk.          ",Self-determination theory and caregiver smoking bans for asthmatic children,7675636,F31NR011266,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Facilities and Administrative Costs ', ' Indirect Costs ', ' Process ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Family ', ' Killings ', ' Guidelines ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Literature ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Smoker ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Self Determination ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Adopted ', ' Attention ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' inner city ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Participant ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Reporting ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' Absenteeism ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Health behavior change ', ' person centered ', ' group intervention ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,F31,2009,34302,0.24946820240883882
"Literacy and improving patient-clinician encounters for Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Low literacy is widespread and particularly prevalent among low-income and minority groups, the same groups in which asthma morbidity is excessive. Inattention by clinicians to the literacy and related health literacy of patients may result in ineffective communication and subsequent poor patient self-management. Some aspects of health literacy such as understanding numerical concepts may be particularly important. We recently developed and validated an asthma-specific numeracy questionnaire (ANQ). We found that many adults do not understand the numerical concepts embedded in standard asthma education. Those with low ANQ scores were also more likely to have had hospitalizations and ED visits for asthma. The initial aims of this application are to use the participants and outcomes of the parent R01 HL073932 to conduct a cohort study to examine the association of (Specific Aim 1) a standard health literacy instrument and (Specific   Aim 2) ANQ with adherence to inhaled steroids (measured electronically), asthma control (FEV1), and asthma-related quality of life in adults with moderate or severe asthma. The parent R01 HL073932 addresses another barrier to successful asthma care involving patient-clinician interaction. It is a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of a behavioral individualized intervention, problem-solving (PS) with standard asthma education (Attention Control (AC)), on these same outcomes. PS seeks to empower lowincome and minority asthmatic adults and allows clinicians to take account of the social context of these patients' lives. Exploratory Aim 3 will examine the interaction between literacy and PS versus AC interventions. We will use focus groups of patients and clinicians to refine the ANQ as a brief individualized assessment for clinicians. We will then develop and pilot an intervention to test whether ANQ-based individualized interventions result in improved adherence and asthma outcomes (Specific Aim 4). This will lead to subsequent research applications to test whether ANQ-based interventions alone or combined with   PS results in better asthma outcomes and adherence. That is, we anticipate that both PS and ANQ will lead to simple brief additive or synergistic ways for clinicians to assess patients and tailor information. My Overarching Research Goal is examine barriers to asthma care that operate at the interface between patient and clinician and that may differentially affect members of ethnic and racial minority groups with my ultimate goal being to design and implement ways to reduce such health disparities. This K02 application will allow me to continue along my current trajectory to become an independent investigator focusing on strategies directed at both clinicians and patients. By enhancing current collaborations, building others, and participating in relevant research working groups, I will create a team of expert collaborators in health and literacy, education, bioenqineerinq (directed at behavior measurement), and behavioral medicine        (End of Abstract)          ",Literacy and improving patient-clinician encounters for Asthma,7586120,K02HL088469,"['K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' working group ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Inhalators ', ' Inhaler ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' literacy ', ' Living Wills ', ' living will ', ' Funding ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Motivation ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Powder dose form ', ' Powders ', ' Prednisone ', ' delta-Cortisone ', ' Prednisonum ', ' Metacortandracin ', ' Deltadehydrocortisone ', ' Deltacortisone ', ' Delta(1)-Cortisone ', ' Dehydrocortisone ', ' 17,21-dihydroxy-pregna-1,4-diene-3,11,20-trione ', ' 1, 2-Dehydrocortisone ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' instrument ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Steroids ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' inattention ', ' inattentiveness ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Visit ', ' empowered ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1 ', ' PFT/FEV1 ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume 1 Test ', ' FEV1%VC ', ' FEV1 ', ' abstracting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Self Management ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight control ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Adult asthma ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' trial comparing ', ' patient population ', ' standard measure ', ' pill (pharmacologic) ', ' Pill ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Electronics ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K02,2009,105219,0.21021921912792746
"Whole Genome Analyses for Asthma in Latino Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, asthma prevalence is highest in Puerto Ricans (26%) and lowest in Mexicans (10%). This is paradoxical since both groups are considered ""Hispanic"" or ""Latino"". Although there are many potential explanations for this observation, including environmental and socioeconomic factors, one potential explanation is that the genetic predisposition to asthma differs among subgroups within the Latino population. Latinos are admixed and share varying proportions of African, Native American and European ancestry. The mixed ancestry of Latinos provides unique opportunities in epidemiological and genetic studies and may be useful in untangling complex gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in disease susceptibility. This proposal will take advantage of clinical data and genomic DNA on 2,100 Puerto Rican and 1,500 Mexican asthma cases and controls collected as part of two large studies of asthma in Latinos (GALA 1 and GALA 2). The goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide association analyses to identify genetic factors associated with asthma and related phenotypes in Puerto Ricans and Mexicans. In addition, potential interactions between these genetic factors and other genes and environmental variables will be investigated. Specifically, we will: 1) genotype Puerto Rican and Mexican asthma cases and controls using the Affymetrix state-of-art 500K GeneChip arrays, 2) perform genome-wide association analysis on 500K GeneChip data to identify SNPs associated with asthma, asthma severity and bronchodilator response. The analysis will include clinical and demographic characteristics, environmental factors and individual admixture estimates to correct for potential confounders. In addition, admixture mapping analysis will be performed to complement the genome-wide association analysis. Admixture mapping may identify novel regions that harbor racial/ethnic specific alleles for asthma and related phenotypes; and 3) fine map SNPs significantly associated with asthma and related phenotypes in genome-wide analyses (initial-hit SNPs). To our knowledge this is the first proposal to perform a genome-wide association analysis for asthma and related phenotypes in Latinos. Due to the size and scope of this project, the results of this study should substantially increase our understanding of the etiology of asthma and drug response. By gaining a better understanding of asthma risk factors in diverse populations, this proposal is consistent with the goals established by Healthy People 2010, which are to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population.

"Promoting Asthma Wellness in Rural Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma, the most common chronic disorder in childhood, disproportionately affects African-Americans (AAs) with both greater morbidity and mortality. AA male youth suffer death rates from asthma that are six times greater than for white male youth of the same age. Among triggers for asthma, tobacco use and passive smoke exposure are considered among the most adverse. Nearly 6.4 million youth living today will die prematurely from tobacco attributable diseases. The higher level of morbidity and mortality among AA youth, at times related to tobacco exposure, emphasize the need for new methods for reaching these youth. With NHLBI funding (HL68971) a culturally sensitive, web-based intervention, termed ""Puff City,"" was developed based on: Motivational Theory, tailoring of information, essential asthma management skills, and entertainment. When this program was evaluated among predominately AA youth attending a Midwestern, urban school system (Detroit Public Schools) promising results (i.e. fewer emergency department visits, fewer hospitalizations, improved quality of life scores, and reduced number of school days missed) were found. The cost of delivering the program was $6.67 per student. Given the initial success of Puff City among the Detroit youth, an important question is whether this intervention will be effective among AA youth living in the rural south: a different cultural, social, and climatic environment. This application seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of the Puff City program in 9th-11th grade, southern, rural youth (N=300) using a randomized, two-group design with repeated measures. Youth randomized to the treatment group will receive the Puff City program and those in the control group will receive equal web-based time on websites that provide education on asthma and tobacco risks. The Puff City intervention consists of four, 30 minute, modules that target three key asthma management issues: reduction of tobacco exposure (i.e. smoking and passive smoke exposure), controller medication adherence, and attack readiness (i.e. carrying a rescue inhaler at all times). Behavioral change will be evaluated by self-report at baseline, end of treatment (short-term), and at six and 12 months follow up (long-term) and also via salivary cotinine and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) at the same time points. The Puff City program is expected to foster the development of personal motivational factors that will result in improved asthma management in all three target areas. The primary hypotheses are: Youth in the treatment arm will have improved behavioral outcomes of: 1) a decrease in passive smoke exposure; 2) greater controller medication adherence; and 3) greater attack readiness. The secondary hypotheses are that treated youth when compared to control youth will also have reduced levels of salivary cotinine and eNO, and a decrease in active smoking. Cross-study comparative analyses will also be performed between the rural South and urban Midwestern youth populations. Consistent with the mission of the NHLBI, this application targets the advancement of socio-cultural behavioral treatments for preventing further asthma and tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and the elimination of health disparities observed for an ethnic minority-AAs. If effective, implementation of this culturally tailored and cost effective approach via school systems as the primary point of entry is highly probable.

"Adolescent-Parent-Provider Communication in Latinos with Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma remains a significant public health concern for pediatric populations and disproportionately impacts ethnic minorities. Youth appear to be at heightened risk for asthma morbidity during adolescence. Research has begun to identify factors that contribute to asthma disparities. Key issues in patient-provider communication, especially for Latinos, may play a role. For adolescents in particular, communication with asthma care providers may be important for successful asthma management and the maintenance of positive clinical outcomes.   The present study proposes to examine adolescent-parent-provider communication in Latino and non-   Latino white youth with asthma, employing both archival data analysis and original data collection methods. Archival data will be made available through the NHLBI funded study entitled ""Pediatric Asthma Disparities: Perceptions and Management,"" which is a joint effort by the Rhode Island-Puerto Rico Asthma Center (RIPRAC; Grant #U01-H1072438; PI G. Fritz). RIPRAC, which was established in 2002, is one of the four NHLBI centers funded to study asthma health disparities.   Quantitative analyses will identify sociocultural factors relating to adolescent-parent-provider communication and associations between adolescent-parent-provider communication and clinical outcomes for Latino and non-Latino white adolescents with asthma. Focus group data will provide an in-depth account of parent and adolescent perspectives of adolescent-parent-provider communication. Using a theory-based model in conjunction with quantitative and qualitative analyses will increase the methodological rigor of this study. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will inform future research regarding adolescent-parent-provider communication and its relation to existing asthma health disparities, and serve as a model for assessing adolescent-parent-provider communication in chronic health conditions with diverse patient groups. Ultimately, this study will facilitate design of future interventions to improve adolescent-parent-provider communication and clinical outcomes, thereby ameliorating existing health disparities for Latino youth and adolescents with asthma.             ",Adolescent-Parent-Provider Communication in Latinos with Asthma,7671284,F32HL094036,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Language ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' Inferior ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' parental role ', ' parent role ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NHLBI,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,F32,2009,47210,0.32728726343512
"Chicago Westside Partnership for Children's Asthma Initiative (CWPC-AI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Asthma is one condition that disproportionately affects poor and minority children living in inner-city neighborhoods. African American children have some of the highest rates documented, and Chicago has been shown to be among the hardest hit cities. The proposed project, the Chicago Westside Partnership for Children's Asthma Initiative (CWPC-AI), aims to translate the Seattle-King County Healthy Homes (SKCHH) environmental intervention model into one that is culturally appropriate and effective for children with poorly controlled asthma living in the poor, African American Westside Chicago community of North Lawndale. A collaborative approach drawing on the strengths of several partners and incorporating full and meaningful participation by the community will be utilized. The initiative builds on the experiences of the Sinai Urban Health Institute (SUHI) and Sinai Children's Hospital (SCH) in conducting and evaluating home-based pediatric asthma interventions utilizing Community Health Workers (CHW). The Metropolitan Tenant's Organization (MTO) will provide support in training CHWs to conduct a thorough environmental assessment, and to work with families in modifying the home environment and behaviors in a way that will reduce exposure to asthma triggers. An MTO Housing Advocate will handle environmental situations beyond the expertise of the CHW. The initiative will also partner with SUHI's Breathing Freedom program, a North Lawndale community-based smoking cessation program, to reduce secondhand smoke exposure among children who have asthma. Attorneys working for Health & Disability Advocates (HDA) will provide pro bono assistance in resolving housing and other issues requiring legal intervention. The Sinai Community Institute (SCI) and Chicago Asthma Consortium (CAC) will build upon their strong community connections in assembling a Community Advisory Committee, which will be instrumental in guiding the intervention process and in developing key relationships necessary in ensuring the success of the initiative. Our goal is to enroll 360 children into CWPC-AI over an 18-month recruitment period, with the intention of completing the entire 12-month intervention with 250 (70%) of the enrolled participants. CHWs will make 5-6 home visits over the course of the intervention, during which they will comprehensively educate the family on asthma and its proper management, focusing heavily on both improving medical management (e.g., recognizing and reacting appropriately to asthma symptoms, medication techniques, etc.) and reducing exposure to home triggers. Referrals to MTO and HDA will be made as necessary. Evaluation activities will focus on documenting the process of the intervention and the associated outcomes (effectiveness). Monitoring of the process is particularly important as it will allow for an assessment of the intervention's translatability, documenting the successes and challenges of implementing the program within the target community, and paving the way for the translation of the initiative to other populations. Qualitative methods will supplement quantitative data collection in better documenting issues related to translatability, assessing both community strengths which facilitate implementation and challenges that impede upon it, and the process of addressing any barriers. One of the specific aims of the project is to significantly impact asthma-related measures of morbidity, urgent health resource utilization and quality of life. Therefore, progress will be monitored towards 2 primary goals (to decrease asthma-related morbidity and to improve quality of life) and 3 intermediate goals (to decrease the number of asthma triggers in the home environment, to improve asthma-related knowledge of the child's primary caregiver and to improve the caregiver's self-efficacy to properly manage asthma). In all instances, a pre-post study design will be utilized, with each participant serving as his/her own historical control. The study has more than adequate power to detect effect sizes that are clinically meaningful. Substantial attention will be paid to matters of fidelity, uptake and other issues that will influence translatability. Throughout, we will operate with the explicit goal of being able to sustain this project after the initial funding has expired. The community, Community Advisory Committee, and all partnering agencies, will work collaboratively to ensure that the approach and its effects are sustained. Through this collaborative approach and implementation of an evidence-based intervention it is believed that CWPC-AI will significantly impact asthma health disparities, ultimately helping to close the gap.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       African American children have been shown to have some of the highest rates of asthma documented, and Chicago has been demonstrated to be among the hardest hit cities.

"Multisystemic therapy to reduce health disparities in adolescents with asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common cause of hospitalization in children other than infections. The Health People 2000 initiative to reduce asthma hospitalizations was NOT met. Minority, inner city children, particularly adolescents, appear to be most at risk for high morbidity and mortality. Poor illness management is thought to be a primary driver of asthma morbidity and mortality. Yet, there are very few randomized controlled trials with inner city adolescents with asthma. Because of the complexity of asthma management and the associated barriers, intensive, multi-component interventions are needed to improve outcomes among those at highest risk. The investigators have adapted Multisystemic Therapy (MST), an innovative home- and community-based psychotherapy, to successfully improve treatment adherence and outcomes in urban pediatric medical populations. The objective of the present study is to utilize MST to improve asthma management and to reduce health care utilization (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) among high risk African American adolescents (ages 12-16) with moderate to severe persistent asthma. High risk is defined as having >=2 emergency department visits or >= 1 hospitalizations in 12 months). Additional aims are to determine the stability of MST's effects over a 12 month interval and to determine cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Families will be recruited from the only university-affiliated medical center in Detroit, Michigan. Detroit has the highest percentage of African Americans of any major city in the United States. The experimental design for the proposed study is a randomized controlled trial with 170 high risk African American adolescents with moderate to severe persistent asthma, 85 of whom will receive standard multidisciplinary specialty care (control condition) and 85 of whom will receive this care plus MST. Families will complete an initial data collection session (baseline), a 7-month post-test designed to coincide with treatment completion, and a subsequent post-test at 12 months after baseline. If successful, this intervention will provide immediate assistance to a vulnerable population disproportionately affected by asthma and may reduce costs of care for this high risk population. While asthma is the second most common cause of hospitalization in children, minority, inner city teens are at increased risk for complications from the disease. We are testing the effectiveness of an intervention for inner city African American teens with asthma using Multisystemic Therapy an intensive, home- and community-based psychotherapy. If successful, this intervention will improve asthma management and overall health, as well as reduce healthcare costs for this vulnerable population disproportionately affected by asthma.          ",Multisystemic therapy to reduce health disparities in adolescents with asthma,7664603,R01HL087272,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Innovative Therapy ', ' Healthy People 2000 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Family psychotherapy ', ' Family Therapy ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Affect ', ' Secondary to ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Chronic ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' African ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Michigan ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity -

"COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP TO REDUCE ASTHMA DISPARITIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric asthma is increasingly common among minority children, and results in considerable healthcare disparity. This application seeks to establish a Community Partnership between Rhode Island Hospital and the Providence Community Health Centers to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to increase use of controller medications for asthma among Latino and African-American children. A Community Advisory Board of parents and key informants will provide ongoing input regarding treatment implementation. Families with children who have persistent asthma symptoms will be enrolled. Three groups will be recruited (N=240 total): African-American families, Latino families who prefer health care in Spanish, and Latino families who prefer health care in English. All families will be enrolled in a brief baseline period. Children who are prescribed oral or inhaled controller medications will have medication use monitored electronically. Research staff will also collect data regarding baseline medication use from pharmacy records and insurance claims. Asthma knowledge, medication beliefs, medication adherence, and asthma morbidity will be assessed at baseline, end of treatment, and at 3-month intervals until 1 year post-treatment. After completing a baseline, all families will attend a group-based asthma education class in their own Community Health Center (one of five CHC's). Families will the be randomized to one of two nurse delivered interventions, either 1) a Standard Care (SC) condition, which emphasizes use of symptom monitoring, peak flow meter, trigger control measures, and a written action plan, or 2) a Medication Adherence (MA) condition, which assesses use of alternative medications, addresses concerns regarding use of controller medications, and uses problem-solving techniques to address barriers to medication use. Follow-up is conducted by researcher assistants at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month time points post-intervention. It is expected that both interventions will increase asthma knowledge, but the MA intervention will yield greater controller medication use and decreased morbidity. It is further expected that differences in medication adherence post-treatment will be mediated by medication beliefs. Lastly, it is anticipated that within the Latino groups, Latinos with low English proficiency will demonstrate the greatest changes from baseline on medication adherence and morbidity. A Sustainability Advisory board will provide guidance regarding project implementation in the community beyond the life of the grant.

"Caregiver Quality of Life in Pediatric Asthma: Family and Cultural Predictors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities in pediatric asthma continue to be a significant public health concern. Racial and ethnic minority children with asthma, particularly Latino and African American children, are at greater risk for increased morbidity (e.g., emergency department (ED) utilization) and mortality. As pediatric asthma is managed within the family context, mechanisms to explain such differences might include parent quality of life (QOL; parent adaption to the child's illness), family beliefs about asthma, and caregiver asthma status. In particular, caregiver QOL may be a key factor in pathways explaining racial and ethnic differences in ED utilization. Further, it is likely that culturally based beliefs about asthma are important aspects of caregiver QOL that are not captured by current measurements of caregiver QOL. Assessments of caregiver QOL provide critical knowledge to health care providers and clinicians regarding the burden that the child's asthma and treatment regimen can present on the family's daily life and barriers to effective asthma control. This study is an investigation of caregiver QOL in Latino (Dominican and Puerto Rican), African American, and Non-Latino White (NLW) families with a child with asthma. First, data collected from the Rhode Island/Puerto Rico Asthma Center for the NHLBI funded study, ""Pediatric Asthma Disparities: Perceptions and Management"" (U01- HI072438, G. Fritz, G. Canino, PIs), will be analyzed. RIPRAC is one of only four NHLBI funded centers examining asthma health disparities. Through these analyses, the validity of the widely used, Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ; Juniper et al., 1996) will be examined among Latino and NLW caregivers in Rhode Island and Puerto Rico. Second, data on 150 Latino, African American, and NLW families with a child with asthma will be collected. Racial and ethnic differences in associations between asthma beliefs, caregiver asthma, caregiver QOL, and ED use will be assessed. Findings from this study will be used to identify modifiable targets of family-based interventions to improve caregiver QOL and decrease morbidity in African American and Latino children with asthma. !      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities in pediatric asthma are a growing public health concern, especially with respect to increased emergency care utilization in Latino and African American children as compared to Non-Latino Whites. As pediatric asthma is managed within families, pathways related to the utilization of emergency services might include the impact of culturally based asthma beliefs on caregiver quality of life.

"Using a Novel Technology to Improve Adherence: School-Based Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, and specific Challenge Topic, 06-OD(OBSSR)-101*: Using new technologies to improve or measure adherence. We propose the development and testing of a novel technology to improve adherence to effective preventive asthma medications and reduce morbidity among young urban children. While NHLBI guidelines recommend daily maintenance medications for all children with persistent asthma, studies indicate that poor adherence is common, and many children in the US who should receive preventive medications are not receiving them. The goal of this new translational project is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing directly observed therapy of preventive asthma medications in school in a real-world setting, using state-of-the-art web-based technology for systematic screening, electronic report generation, and communication between nurses, caregivers, and primary care providers. This study builds on our experience with a prior study of 530 children that demonstrated that school-based administration of preventive asthma medications improves asthma symptoms and reduces absenteeism. In order for this program to have sustainable public health impact, we must now develop the technology for systematic screening and communication in order to integrate it within the school and community systems that serve these high risk children. We propose a two-year study to develop an integrated system for the sustained delivery of preventive asthma medications in schools using web-based technology (year 1), and to conduct a pilot randomized trial to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of the intervention on asthma morbidity, including symptom-free days, quality of life, absenteeism, and urgent health care use (year 2). We also will evaluate the added cost to implement and sustain this new system of care. In the first year, we will develop the technology for this new system of care and refine the intervention using expert consultation with key informants and focus group methodology. The second year will consist of a randomized trial to test this model of care with 80 students from 12 inner-city schools. We hypothesize that this novel adaptation of school-based asthma care will; 1) be feasible and acceptable among this population and among school and community personnel, and 2) yield reduced asthma morbidity (symptom-free days, absenteeism, and emergency room / urgent care use for asthma care). There currently are no practical, system-wide interventions for urban children with asthma that assure that children take the medications they should be receiving. The proposed intervention could have a major public health impact as a model for asthma care in communities nationwide to improve outcomes and reduce disparities. Further, it provides the opportunity to substantially accelerate the diffusion of a novel method to improve adherence and subsequently reduce morbidity, without interruption of a highly successful community-based collaboration. - RELEVANCE  There currently are no practical, system-wide interventions for urban children with asthma that assure that children are receiving appropriate preventive care. Importantly, effective asthma therapies will not work if they are not used by the patients who need them. This intervention is designed to implement guideline- based asthma care through an innovative program in the city schools.

"Chicago Westside Partnership for Children's Asthma Initiative (CWPC-AI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Asthma is one condition that disproportionately affects poor and minority children living in inner-city neighborhoods. African American children have some of the highest rates documented, and Chicago has been shown to be among the hardest hit cities. The proposed project, the Chicago Westside Partnership for Children's Asthma Initiative (CWPC-AI), aims to translate the Seattle-King County Healthy Homes (SKCHH) environmental intervention model into one that is culturally appropriate and effective for children with poorly controlled asthma living in the poor, African American Westside Chicago community of North Lawndale. A collaborative approach drawing on the strengths of several partners and incorporating full and meaningful participation by the community will be utilized. The initiative builds on the experiences of the Sinai Urban Health Institute (SUHI) and Sinai Children's Hospital (SCH) in conducting and evaluating home-based pediatric asthma interventions utilizing Community Health Workers (CHW). The Metropolitan Tenant's Organization (MTO) will provide support in training CHWs to conduct a thorough environmental assessment, and to work with families in modifying the home environment and behaviors in a way that will reduce exposure to asthma triggers. An MTO Housing Advocate will handle environmental situations beyond the expertise of the CHW. The initiative will also partner with SUHI's Breathing Freedom program, a North Lawndale community-based smoking cessation program, to reduce secondhand smoke exposure among children who have asthma. Attorneys working for Health & Disability Advocates (HDA) will provide pro bono assistance in resolving housing and other issues requiring legal intervention. The Sinai Community Institute (SCI) and Chicago Asthma Consortium (CAC) will build upon their strong community connections in assembling a Community Advisory Committee, which will be instrumental in guiding the intervention process and in developing key relationships necessary in ensuring the success of the initiative. Our goal is to enroll 360 children into CWPC-AI over an 18-month recruitment period, with the intention of completing the entire 12-month intervention with 250 (70%) of the enrolled participants. CHWs will make 5-6 home visits over the course of the intervention, during which they will comprehensively educate the family on asthma and its proper management, focusing heavily on both improving medical management (e.g., recognizing and reacting appropriately to asthma symptoms, medication techniques, etc.) and reducing exposure to home triggers. Referrals to MTO and HDA will be made as necessary. Evaluation activities will focus on documenting the process of the intervention and the associated outcomes (effectiveness). Monitoring of the process is particularly important as it will allow for an assessment of the intervention's translatability, documenting the successes and challenges of implementing the program within the target community, and paving the way for the translation of the initiative to other populations. Qualitative methods will supplement quantitative data collection in better documenting issues related to translatability, assessing both community strengths which facilitate implementation and challenges that impede upon it, and the process of addressing any barriers. One of the specific aims of the project is to significantly impact asthma-related measures of morbidity, urgent health resource utilization and quality of life. Therefore, progress will be monitored towards 2 primary goals (to decrease asthma-related morbidity and to improve quality of life) and 3 intermediate goals (to decrease the number of asthma triggers in the home environment, to improve asthma-related knowledge of the child's primary caregiver and to improve the caregiver's self-efficacy to properly manage asthma). In all instances, a pre-post study design will be utilized, with each participant serving as his/her own historical control. The study has more than adequate power to detect effect sizes that are clinically meaningful. Substantial attention will be paid to matters of fidelity, uptake and other issues that will influence translatability. Throughout, we will operate with the explicit goal of being able to sustain this project after the initial funding has expired. The community, Community Advisory Committee, and all partnering agencies, will work collaboratively to ensure that the approach and its effects are sustained. Through this collaborative approach and implementation of an evidence-based intervention it is believed that CWPC-AI will significantly impact asthma health disparities, ultimately helping to close the gap.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       African American children have been shown to have some of the highest rates of asthma documented, and Chicago has been demonstrated to be among the hardest hit cities.

"Reducing Asthma Disparities: The Baltimore City Healthy Homes Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract ""Reducing Asthma Disparities: The Baltimore City Healthy Homes Initiative"" (RAD) will reduce racial disparities in asthma morbidity in Baltimore by providing an evidence- based healthy homes intervention to the families of 250 Baltimore Public School students aged 4-18 who have persistent asthma. The RAD Initiative is a translation research project, adapting the effective Seattle-King County (SKC) model. The SKC Healthy Homes program has significantly reduced asthma symptom days and urgent health service usage (Krieger et al., 2005). We will enhance the SKC intervention to address risks specific to Baltimore through: 1) maternal depression screening and referrals, 2) strengthened rodent reduction measures, 3) lead poisoning prevention, 4) additional injury prevention, 5) motivational interviewing to reduce environmental tobacco smoke, and 6) recruitment through the schools. This translation research will compare and contrast the intervention costs, medical costs, home environmental health outcomes and children's asthma-related health outcomes in 250 intervention children and a comparable group of 250 non-intervention Medicaid enrolled children with persistent asthma. The RAD Initiative will be lead by the Baltimore City Health Department's Healthy Homes Division, whose mission is to improve the health of children and their families by reducing housing hazards tied to asthma, lead exposure, and injuries. In addition to helping the BCHD achieve its long-term goal of reducing asthma disparities, the RAD Initiative's specific aims include, first, disseminating project findings broadly to city, state, and national stakeholders through a Baltimore community conference, student-produced video, journal articles, community and conference presentations, and web-based information and materials. Second, the RAD Initiative will identify mechanisms by which the program can be sustained over time and scaled up to address the needs of all at-risk Baltimore families of children with asthma. Third, the RAD Initiative aims to use a coordinated, public-private partnership approach to extend the reach of healthy homes home visiting programs. The RAD Initiative represents the alliance of two universities, two city agencies, the state, Baltimore City's congressional delegation, a youth-focused social action organization, an asthma coalition, and a coalition of African-American charities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Project Narrative By adapting the Seattle King County Healthy Homes approach to the Baltimore environment and new research findings, we aim to reduce disparities related to childhood asthma, lead poisoning, and injuries.

"Literacy and improving patient-clinician encounters for Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Low literacy is widespread and particularly prevalent among low-income and minority groups, the same groups in which asthma morbidity is excessive. Inattention by clinicians to the literacy and related health literacy of patients may result in ineffective communication and subsequent poor patient self-management. Some aspects of health literacy such as understanding numerical concepts may be particularly important. We recently developed and validated an asthma-specific numeracy questionnaire (ANQ). We found that many adults do not understand the numerical concepts embedded in standard asthma education. Those with low ANQ scores were also more likely to have had hospitalizations and ED visits for asthma. The initial aims of this application are to use the participants and outcomes of the parent R01 HL073932 to conduct a cohort study to examine the association of (Specific Aim 1) a standard health literacy instrument and (Specific   Aim 2) ANQ with adherence to inhaled steroids (measured electronically), asthma control (FEV1), and asthma-related quality of life in adults with moderate or severe asthma. The parent R01 HL073932 addresses another barrier to successful asthma care involving patient-clinician interaction. It is a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of a behavioral individualized intervention, problem-solving (PS) with standard asthma education (Attention Control (AC)), on these same outcomes. PS seeks to empower lowincome and minority asthmatic adults and allows clinicians to take account of the social context of these patients' lives. Exploratory Aim 3 will examine the interaction between literacy and PS versus AC interventions. We will use focus groups of patients and clinicians to refine the ANQ as a brief individualized assessment for clinicians. We will then develop and pilot an intervention to test whether ANQ-based individualized interventions result in improved adherence and asthma outcomes (Specific Aim 4). This will lead to subsequent research applications to test whether ANQ-based interventions alone or combined with   PS results in better asthma outcomes and adherence. That is, we anticipate that both PS and ANQ will lead to simple brief additive or synergistic ways for clinicians to assess patients and tailor information. My Overarching Research Goal is examine barriers to asthma care that operate at the interface between patient and clinician and that may differentially affect members of ethnic and racial minority groups with my ultimate goal being to design and implement ways to reduce such health disparities. This K02 application will allow me to continue along my current trajectory to become an independent investigator focusing on strategies directed at both clinicians and patients. By enhancing current collaborations, building others, and participating in relevant research working groups, I will create a team of expert collaborators in health and literacy, education, bioenqineerinq (directed at behavior measurement), and behavioral medicine        (End of Abstract)          ",Literacy and improving patient-clinician encounters for Asthma,7790599,K02HL088469,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Electronics ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' working group ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Inhalators ', ' Inhaler ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' literacy ', ' Funding ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Motivation ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Powder dose form ', ' Powders ', ' Prednisone ', ' delta-Cortisone ', ' Prednisonum ', ' Metacortandracin ', ' Deltadehydrocortisone ', ' Deltacortisone ', ' Delta(1)-Cortisone ', ' Dehydrocortisone ', ' 17,21-dihydroxy-pregna-1,4-diene-3,11,20-trione ', ' 1, 2-Dehydrocortisone ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' instrument ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Steroids ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' inattention ', ' inattentiveness ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Visit ', ' empowered ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1 ', ' PFT/FEV1 ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume 1 Test ', ' FEV1%VC ', ' FEV1 ', ' abstracting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Self Management ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight control ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Adult asthma ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' trial comparing ', ' patient population ', ' standard measure ', ' pill (pharmacologic) ', ' Pill ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K02,2010,105219,0.21021921912792746
"Coping Peer Intervention for Adherence in Urban African American Adolescents with    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High rates of asthma morbidity and mortality among inner-city African American adolescents demand urgent intervention. Compared to white non-Hispanic and Hispanic children, black non-Hispanic children have the highest rates of hospitalizations and deaths due to asthma. To address this disparity, the investigators have designed a culturally sensitive intervention aimed at improving adherence to daily controller medications for asthma, and ultimately reduce asthma exacerbation risk, that fits easily into adolescents' chaotic lifestyles. The proposed study is a behavioral randomized controlled trial that tests if a coping peer intervention can increase adherence to asthma controller medications among urban African American adolescents 14 to 16 years of age. To ensure the project's success, the principal investigator has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of researchers, including behavioral and social science experts and a community asthma leader. The Specific Aims propose to: (1) evaluate the impact of a 3-month coping peer support intervention on adherence and knowledge, compared to an attention control; (2) evaluate the ability of a 3-month and a 6-month coping peer support intervention to achieve sustained post-treatment improvements in adherence and knowledge, compared to an attention control; and (3) to develop estimates needed for the design of a subsequent R01 behavioral controlled trial testing the efficacy of this intervention to decrease risk of asthma exacerbations. The study's primary outcome is adherence to daily asthma controller medications, measured using an objective electronic monitor. Study participants will be randomized to receive equal medical supervision and music tracks plus either: (1) group support, coping peer group problem solving, and peer delivered asthma messages (experimental group); or (2) physician developed and recorded general health messages (attention control group) on a portable MP3 player. The group support and coping peer group problem solving consists of: putting subjects together in a small group to discuss barriers to adherence and ways to overcome these barriers; then having group members record messages to each other about overcoming barriers that will be played on their MP3 player, between music tracks, during the course of their daily routines. This effectively brings the coping peer support from the group into the course of the adolescents' day-to-day lives. The investigators hypothesize that it is the ability of the MP3 player to facilitate ongoing peer support that will be the basis for improved adherence. The long term goal is to apply the data from this research to submit an R01 grant application to conduct a behavioral randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of this coping peer intervention to improve adherence, and ultimately reduce asthma exacerbations, in urban African American adolescents with asthma.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Inner-city African American adolescents suffer from disproportionately high rates of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for acute exacerbations of asthma. This study proposes the use of a coping peer support intervention, enhanced by a technology-based platform that infuses the peer support throughout adolescents' daily routines, to increase adherence to daily controller medications and ultimately reduce asthma exacerbation risk in this important population subgroup. This research is based on the principle that, to promote sustained adherence to appropriate medications in this target population, interventions must be culturally competent and fit easily into adolescents' lifestyles.            Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Coping Peer Intervention for Adherence Project Narrative Inner-city African American adolescents suffer from disproportionately high rates of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for acute exacerbations of asthma.

"Explaining Racial Disparities in Child Asthma Morbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  Asthma is a leading cause of childhood morbidity, however the burden falls disproportionately on minority children and children of low socioeconomic status. Despite advances in asthma care, disparities in rates of asthma emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, and re-hospitalizations remain persistently high. The NIH seeks personalized approaches based on genes and biomarkers to identify and treat diseases at their earliest stages. Similar tailored approaches must be developed to prevent and ameliorate racial disparities in health at their earliest stages. This applications seeks to characterize remediable social and environmental factors most relevant to excess asthma morbidity in disadvantaged children.  The central objective of this project is to examine children hospitalized with asthma to explore how race shapes social and environmental factors and how these, in turn, may influence the likelihood of re- admission for asthma. Genes are not a focus of the current applications, but DNA will be collected for future gene-environment studies. Fully characterizing the social and environmental components of race differences will help ensure that the search for genetic susceptibilities is a thoughtful and balanced one. We will enroll a population-based prospective cohort of children hospitalized with asthma and examine their risk of re-hospitalization and ER use for asthma over time with a primary focus on disparities in readmission.  The specific aims are to: 1) characterize racial differences in risk of asthma-related re- hospitalization and ER visits after an index hospitalization and to examine in detail the potential contributions of socioeconomic status to that disparity (contrasting individual and area level measures of SES), 2) examine selected environmental exposures (traffic exposure, biomarker of tobacco smoke exposure, allergic sensitization) and psychosocial variables (adherence, caregiver stress) in relation to both asthma morbidity and race, and 3) examine the extent to which these environmental and psychosocial exposures explain disparities in time to asthma re-hospitalization rate and ER visits.  This study offers a careful characterization of disparities in asthma morbidity along with a detailed look at potential mediators of these disparities. The innovation of the grant includes its focus on pathways most relevant to disease disparities, its broad 'geography to genes' framework, its emphasis on children at highest risk, and its population-based sample. This submission by a new investigator brings together stellar investigators with a broad spectrum of expertise. Moreover, the research occurs in an institutional environment with highly developed asthma research programs and one committed to developing effective interventions. We envision moving aggressively toward real-time clinical interventions that tailor effective disease management plans best suited to help children with the fewest resources.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Asthma is a leading cause of childhood morbidity.

AA male youth suffer death rates from asthma that are six times greater than for white male youth of the same age. Among triggers for asthma, tobacco use and passive smoke exposure are considered among the most adverse. Nearly 6.4 million youth living today will die prematurely from tobacco attributable diseases. The higher level of morbidity and mortality among AA youth, at times related to tobacco exposure, emphasize the need for new methods for reaching these youth. With NHLBI funding (HL68971) a culturally sensitive, web-based intervention, termed ""Puff City,"" was developed based on: Motivational Theory, tailoring of information, essential asthma management skills, and entertainment. When this program was evaluated among predominately AA youth attending a Midwestern, urban school system (Detroit Public Schools) promising results (i.e. fewer emergency department visits, fewer hospitalizations, improved quality of life scores, and reduced number of school days missed) were found. The cost of delivering the program was $6.67 per student. Given the initial success of Puff City among the Detroit youth, an important question is whether this intervention will be effective among AA youth living in the rural south: a different cultural, social, and climatic environment. This application seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of the Puff City program in 9th-11th grade, southern, rural youth (N=300) using a randomized, two-group design with repeated measures. Youth randomized to the treatment group will receive the Puff City program and those in the control group will receive equal web-based time on websites that provide education on asthma and tobacco risks. The Puff City intervention consists of four, 30 minute, modules that target three key asthma management issues: reduction of tobacco exposure (i.e. smoking and passive smoke exposure), controller medication adherence, and attack readiness (i.e. carrying a rescue inhaler at all times). Behavioral change will be evaluated by self-report at baseline, end of treatment (short-term), and at six and 12 months follow up (long-term) and also via salivary cotinine and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) at the same time points. The Puff City program is expected to foster the development of personal motivational factors that will result in improved asthma management in all three target areas. The primary hypotheses are: Youth in the treatment arm will have improved behavioral outcomes of: 1) a decrease in passive smoke exposure; 2) greater controller medication adherence; and 3) greater attack readiness. The secondary hypotheses are that treated youth when compared to control youth will also have reduced levels of salivary cotinine and eNO, and a decrease in active smoking. Cross-study comparative analyses will also be performed between the rural South and urban Midwestern youth populations. Consistent with the mission of the NHLBI, this application targets the advancement of socio-cultural behavioral treatments for preventing further asthma and tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and the elimination of health disparities observed for an ethnic minority-AAs. If effective, implementation of this culturally tailored and cost effective approach via school systems as the primary point of entry is highly probable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research addresses two significant public health concerns, asthma and tobacco use in a largely neglected population, African American youth living in a rural area.

"Genetic Susceptibility to Asthma and IndoorAir Pollution in Peru    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is an epidemic that disproportionately affects children, the poor and certain racial/ethnic groups. Latinos/Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the US and are disproportionately affected by asthma morbidity. From 1990 to 2000 there was an 81 percent increase in number of people that mark their ethnic origin as Peruvian on the US Census survey and the prevalence of asthma in Peru is among one of the highest in the world. Asthma is a complex disease and genetic risk for asthma and asthma morbidity may be modified by environmental exposures. The indoor environment is of particular concern as most people spend the majority of their time indoors. Investigators in this application have shown that high levels of indoor exposures, including particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), are independently associated with greater asthma morbidity, and are particularly high in Peruvian homes. The burden of asthma attributable to differences in domestic PM and NO2 concentrations is substantial; however, not all children are susceptible to effects of pollutant exposure and a large variation in response exists between individuals. These findings suggest a strong possibility of an interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental exposure in the development of asthma. To address the critical questions of the role of genetic susceptibility to the adverse effects of indoor air pollution on asthma, we will build upon the infrastructure and ongoing data collection efforts in Peru. We propose a candidate gene study to identify genetic variants associated with asthma and its associated traits (i.e., asthma severity, pulmonary function, airway inflammation) in relation to indoor air pollutant exposure in two Peruvian cities, Lima and Tumbes. We will prioritize candidate genes identified by published genome-wide association studies for asthma as well as those in the oxidative stress pathway thought to be relevant to pollutant exposure and asthma. We will cross-validate associations identified in well characterized asthma cases and controls from Lima, Peru (n=1,400), in a second independent population of asthmatic cases and controls recruited from Tumbes, Peru (n=400). Specific Aim #1: To identify genes associated with asthma in children in Peru. Specific Aim #2: To determine if genetic risk for asthma is modified by indoor air pollutant (PM, NO2) concentrations. We anticipate identifying candidate genes for asthma and associated traits relevant to both the general population as well as those contributing to disparities in asthma morbidity among individuals in Peru. Identifying subgroups of the population who are particularly vulnerable to air pollution is an important objective, as the results can be used to identify people most likely to benefit from exposure avoidance.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and over 300 million people suffer from asthma worldwide, suggesting a large public health burden.

"Reducing Asthma Disparities Through School-Based Telemedicine for Rural Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma disproportionately burdens minority and low-income pediatric populations, and these disparities have persisted among high-risk children despite the dissemination of NHLBI asthma management guidelines more than a decade ago. Previous investigations suggest that asthma guidelines-based care has not translated to high-risk children living in rural regions. Asthma-related morbidity and non-adherence to asthma guidelines is prevalent among high-risk rural children living in the Mississippi Delta region of Arkansas, an impoverished and medically underserved region of the United States. Large-scale interventions to decrease asthma burden among high-risk rural children have not been designed, and interventions designed for other populations are not feasible due to distance and travel barriers and lack of subspecialty asthma services inherent to rural communities. The overall goal of the proposed project is to decrease asthma health outcomes disparities among high-risk children living in a rural, medically underserved environment. To address this goal, we propose conducting a cluster randomized trial with 540 children, ages 4-17 years, to implement a school-based telemedicine intervention in rural public school districts. The school-based intervention will provide comprehensive asthma education via telemedicine to rural children with asthma, their caregivers and school nurses; prospectively monitor asthma symptoms and lung function via telemedicine; and provide primary care providers with treatment prompts according to nationally published asthma guidelines. We hypothesize that children receiving school-based asthma education and monitoring via telemedicine in conjunction with a provider treatment prompt will have decreased asthma-related morbidity as compared to children receiving usual care. The aims of the project will: 1) examine the efficacy of a school-based asthma telemedicine intervention in improving asthma-related health outcomes in an intervention group compared to a usual care group; 2) examine the effects of a school-based asthma telemedicine intervention on asthma self-management skills; and 3) determine the cost of the intervention. Telemedicine will allow for the utilization of proven technology to deliver a state-of-the-art asthma intervention in a high-risk population and will significantly reduce challenges associated with distance and travel barriers inherent to rural communities. An innovative telemedicine approach to improve asthma health outcomes among high-risk rural children has high impact potential because findings from the proposed intervention will directly inform public health strategies to implement large-scale telemedicine services in a school-based setting. The intervention will have direct applicability to other high-risk asthma populations in rural and medically underserved regions and can be translated to school-based health intervention strategies to target other chronic health conditions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project may have a profound impact on public health because it presents a practical school-based intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines. Should it prove successful in reducing symptoms and improving the health of rural children with asthma, it has the potential to serve as a model for improved asthma care in other medically underserved communities.           NARR ATIVE - RELEVANCE This project may have a profound impact on public health because it presents a practical school-based intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines.

"Asthma Disparities in Latino Children:Acculturation,Illness Representations & CAM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethnic disparities in asthma health outcomes among Latino children are so striking that researchers and public health officials have issued a call for action to understand why this is occurring. Recent descriptive asthma research confirmed that these disparities are not totally explained by genetic, environmental, healthcare system or provider factors. Little research has been conducted integrating, in one explanatory model, the multitude of factors that lead to disparities. Perhaps of importance, but not well examined, is the role that illness representations (the way one interprets health and illness that influences management of health problems) may play in parents' decisions to use CAM and controller medications to manage their children's asthma. Parents are the gatekeepers for their children's healthcare and ultimately make the final treatment decisions. Before developing interventions targeting asthma health disparities, a more thorough understanding of the interaction of individual, cultural, experiential, and healthcare system factors and the social-environmental context is needed. The proposed study moves the research from descriptive studies to a multi-level examination of the interaction of social, cultural, experiential, environmental, and healthcare system factors on disparities in asthma control among Mexican and Puerto Rican children. The aims of this study are 1) to explore differences in illness representations between these Latino subgroups due to social and contextual factors, and 2) to test a growth model examining disparities in asthma control as a function of differences in parents' treatment decisions (CAM and controller medication use) and changes in illness representations over one year. This will be a one-year longitudinal, multi-site study of parental illness representations and CAM and controller medication use among a sample of 300 Latino (primarily Mexican and Puerto Rican) parents and children aged 5-12 who have asthma. Interviews and child assessments will be conducted with parents and children at enrollment, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment. This assessment schedule allows us to capture seasonal variations in the children's asthma symptoms as well as conform to the recommendation that children on daily controller medications have follow-up visits every 3 months. We will obtain spirometry measures from the children, and review children's medical records. To ensure diverse representation of Latino families and healthcare settings, the sample will be recruited from two community school-based health clinics and one clinical practice site in Phoenix, AZ, and two inner-city hospital asthma clinics in Bronx, NY. A multisite study is warranted because neither site alone has sufficient numbers of both Mexican and Puerto Rican families to conduct this research independently. It is preferable that interviews and assessments be conducted simultaneously among these two populations to minimize seasonal variations in asthma symptom control and to maximize standardization of administration of the surveys across time and samples. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ethnic disparities in childhood asthma outcomes between Mexican and Puerto Rican children asthma outcomes are so striking that researchers and public health officials have issued a call for action to understand why this is occurring. The factors leading to asthma health disparities between Mexican and Puerto Rican children are complex, yet little research has been conducted integrating, in one explanatory model, the multitude of factors that can lead to these disparities. The proposed study moves the research from descriptive studies of individual constructs and contexts to testing an integrated, multi-factorial model. The innovation of this project lies in the multi-level examination of co-varying influences (socio-demographic, cultural, experiential, environmental, and healthcare system) on disparities in asthma control among a sample of 300 Mexican and Puerto Rican children and their parents over a one year period.           Project Narrative  Ethnic disparities in childhood asthma outcomes between Mexican and Puerto Rican children asthma outcomes are so striking that researchers and public health officials have issued a call for action to understand why this is occurring.The factors leading to asthma health disparities between Mexican and Puerto Rican children are complex, yet little research has been conducted integrating, in one explanatory model, the multitude of factors that can lead to these disparities.

"Asthma Management and Ethnic Disparities at the Adolescent Transition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised K24 application proposes a mentorship program in patient-oriented research in pediatric asthma, with a specific focus on health care disparities and disease management behaviors. The K24 Candidate is an Associate Professor (Research) in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior of the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, with a history of funding in behavioral interventions to improve disease management and address health disparities in pediatric asthma. Training Plan: The candidate will obtain additional training in longitudinal data analysis, behavioral genetics, evaluation and assessment in health education, and health care access for Latino immigrants to enrich her skills and mentoring capacity in future health care disparities research. Research Plan: A longitudinal study of medication adherence for Latinos and non-Latino white (NLW) youth with asthma is proposed to assess the differential course of medication adherence by culture across the transition to adolescence. Three waves of 50 youth with persistent asthma (150 total, 25 Latino, 25 NLW in each wave) will complete a multimethod assessment of asthma status, family factors, medication beliefs, and controller medication use. Assessments will occur in eighth grade, then again in tenth grade, with continuous monitoring of medication adherence throughout. Analyses will evaluate the role of medication beliefs and family connectedness in supporting asthma management in Latino and NLW youth with persistent asthma, and assess differential trajectories of medication use by ethnic group over time. Mentoring Plan: The proposed mentoring plan offers participation in an RCT to address asthma disparities in medication use, access to an ongoing educational program for asthma that serves over 700 families a year, and an archival dataset that includes a wealth of data on disease management behavior in over 800 Latino and NLW children in Rl and Puerto Rico. An additional ongoing seminar is planned for junior faculty on topics such as recruiting and retaining culturally diverse samples, and preparing research grant applications.

"NIH Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under the leadership of its current Commissioner, John Auerbach, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has identified the elimination of racial and ethnic disparities in health as one of its most important priorities. The proposed Reducing Environmental Asthma Disparities in Youth (READY) study reflects the Department's mission and priorities. The proposed READY study will examine how race, ethnicity, country of origin of parents, language, socioeconomic status, insurance status and education level of parents will influence the ability of the intervention to reduce health disparities. The study will enroll 400 low-income families with children ages 2-11 years with diagnosed asthma for a one-year home-visiting intervention implemented by community health workers. Participants will be patients at one of four clinical sites - a hospital- based asthma clinic in Boston with a predominantly African-American population, a neighborhood health center in Boston with a predominantly Caribbean/Haitian population born outside the US, a large community health center in the city of Lawrence, Massachusetts, serving a predominantly Hispanic population and a large non- profit, multi-specialty medical group practice in Boston serving white and minority patients with both private and public insurance. The study hypothesis is that the combination of two proven interventions - the Seattle Healthy Homes model, which addresses substandard housing conditions that exacerbate asthma, and the Wee Wheezers education curriculum, which improves parent understanding of asthma and raise parental expectations - together will reduce disparities in asthma symptom control for children ages 2 to 11 years among racial and ethnic minorities, and can be adopted in different health care settings for different racial and ethnic populations. Community Health Workers (CHWs) will ensure that the interventions are effectively deployed and will facilitate communication between patients and providers. The proposed study has three specific aims: 1) The READY intervention will reduce racial and ethnic disparities in substandard housing conditions that exacerbate asthma, such as pest infestations and mold exposure and improve parental understanding in the importance of reducing asthma triggers; 2) The READY intervention will reduce racial and ethnic disparities in parental expectations of asthma control and improve concordance between health care provider and parental reports of asthma control for better communication in asthma management; and 3) The READY intervention will reduce racial and ethnic disparities in asthma morbidity and disability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Reducing Environmental Asthma Disparities in Youth study will examine significant pediatric asthma disparities by race, ethnicity and income and the contribution of differing environmental exposures, particularly substandard housing which is commonly found in neighborhoods where children from low income and racial and ethnic minority populations live.           Project Narrative The proposed Reducing Environmental Asthma Disparities in Youth study will examine significant pediatric asthma disparities by race, ethnicity and income and the contribution of differing environmental exposures, particularly substandard housing which is commonly found in neighborhoods where children from low income and racial and ethnic minority populations live.",NIH Health Disparities,7942888,R01ES017407,"['Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Provider ', ' Juniper ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Low Literacy Population ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Foundations ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Group Practice ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hospitals ', ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Housing ', ' Site ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Leadership ', ' Individual ', ' Parenting Education ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Americas ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity -

"A Patient Advocate and Literacy-Based Treatment of Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05), Comparative Effectiveness Research, and Specific Challenge Topic 05-MD105, Health Literacy. Half of US adults have no more than basic reading and numerical skills; inadequate health literacy is a consequence. It is associated with unsatisfactory patient-provider communication and poor health outcomes in chronic diseases including asthma. We found low numeracy to be associated with prior ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma and determined that numerical skill may attenuate the association of minority status with lower asthma-related quality of life. We propose a Patient Advocate Intervention (PAI) as the most practical immediate but sustainable method of achieving effective health literacy (EHL) (understanding of asthma management and the practice/health system). Adapted from the Patient Navigator of Harold P. Freeman, MD and informed by focus groups of asthma patients, the PAI addresses low literacy, facilitating patient-provider communication surrounding self-management and navigation of the practice and health system to ensure medical recommendations can be accomplished. The PA is a nonprofessional with guidance from a social worker who will assist with and model preparations for a visit with the asthma doctor, attend the visit, and afterwards confirm understanding as well as facilitate scheduling, obtaining insurance coverage, and overcoming other barriers to carrying out medical advice. The primary outcome is electronically-monitored use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the treatment of choice for all but the mildest asthma. ICS use is a marker of successful patient-provider communication. Other outcomes are asthma-related: hospitalizations, ED visits, change in FEV1, and asthma-related quality of life. We hypothesize that the PAI will improve these outcomes by promoting EHL. We will enroll 84 adults with a high prevalence of low numerical skills who are approximately 67% black and 10% Latino with moderate or severe asthma to carry out the following Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: refine and evaluate the feasibility of PAI and Specific Aim 2: conduct a randomized comparison of PAI with standard asthma education to obtain effect size estimates for ICS adherence and asthma-related outcomes for a future R01 confirmatory randomized trial of the final version of PAI. Exploratory analyses will assess EHL as a mediator, various moderators, and estimate the incremental costs of PAI. This novel project fills several research gaps. It 1) compares and tests an intervention addressing literacy to improve health, one that can easily be incorporated into practice to better patient self-management and preventive care, 2) is a potentially long-lasting intervention which will benefit all patients, especially those with low health literacy, and 3) will potentially improve prevention of asthma exacerbations, reducing the need for ED use. It fulfills ARRA goals by creating or retaining partial or complete funding for 16 area jobs. Half of US adults have no more than basic reading and numerical skills. A consequence is inadequate health literacy, which is associated with unsatisfactory patient-provider communication and poor health outcomes in chronic diseases, including asthma. We have adapted a patient navigator intervention to address asthma in high risk communities as a practical, immediate, and sustainable method of achieving effective health literacy in patients low health literacy. This intervention will lead to improved adherence and asthma control, attenuating health disparities so marked in asthma. It is compared for efficacy and cost-effectiveness with asthma education.

"Whole Genome Analyses for Asthma in Latino Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, asthma prevalence is highest in Puerto Ricans (26%) and lowest in Mexicans (10%). This is paradoxical since both groups are considered ""Hispanic"" or ""Latino"". Although there are many potential explanations for this observation, including environmental and socioeconomic factors, one potential explanation is that the genetic predisposition to asthma differs among subgroups within the Latino population. Latinos are admixed and share varying proportions of African, Native American and European ancestry. The mixed ancestry of Latinos provides unique opportunities in epidemiological and genetic studies and may be useful in untangling complex gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in disease susceptibility. This proposal will take advantage of clinical data and genomic DNA on 2,100 Puerto Rican and 1,500 Mexican asthma cases and controls collected as part of two large studies of asthma in Latinos (GALA 1 and GALA 2). The goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide association analyses to identify genetic factors associated with asthma and related phenotypes in Puerto Ricans and Mexicans. In addition, potential interactions between these genetic factors and other genes and environmental variables will be investigated. Specifically, we will: 1) genotype Puerto Rican and Mexican asthma cases and controls using the Affymetrix state-of-art 500K GeneChip arrays, 2) perform genome-wide association analysis on 500K GeneChip data to identify SNPs associated with asthma, asthma severity and bronchodilator response. The analysis will include clinical and demographic characteristics, environmental factors and individual admixture estimates to correct for potential confounders. In addition, admixture mapping analysis will be performed to complement the genome-wide association analysis. Admixture mapping may identify novel regions that harbor racial/ethnic specific alleles for asthma and related phenotypes; and 3) fine map SNPs significantly associated with asthma and related phenotypes in genome-wide analyses (initial-hit SNPs). To our knowledge this is the first proposal to perform a genome-wide association analysis for asthma and related phenotypes in Latinos. Due to the size and scope of this project, the results of this study should substantially increase our understanding of the etiology of asthma and drug response. By gaining a better understanding of asthma risk factors in diverse populations, this proposal is consistent with the goals established by Healthy People 2010, which are to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population.

"BELT: Blacks & Exacerbations on LABA vs. Tiotropium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Blacks bear a disproportionate burden of asthma morbidity and mortality. In its 2005 report on ethnic disparities in health care, AHRQ identified hospital admissions for asthma as the second largest disparity in quality of health care for Blacks versus Whites. Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), a popular treatment option for asthma, are in a class of drugs acting at ADRB2, which have been associated with rare loss of long-term asthma control and increased serious adverse outcomes including death and respiratory failure, even when used with ICS. The risk appears to be four to five-folds greater in Blacks than non-Black patients with asthma. Comparison of studies with LABA/ICS in Blacks versus studies where Blacks were a small minority suggests that Blacks may have much less benefit than other racial groups. Additionally, recent data (Wechsler 2009) suggest that a polymorphism at the 16th position of the ADRB2 gene identifies a group of Blacks (those homozygous for arginine (Arg16Arg)) in whom the response of adding a LABA to an ICS is further diminished. This polymorphism is present in ~20% of U.S. Blacks. In order to address the resulting knowledge gaps, a study is proposed to determine, in a one year practice-based, real-world, randomized, prospective, parallel group, longitudinal comparative effectiveness trial with the clinically important primary outcome of asthma exacerbations, whether in self-identified Black patients with asthma, treatment with LABA/ICS is superior to use of a non-2-adrenergic bronchodilator (tiotropium) combined with ICS (Tio/ICS). The study will also aim to determine, whether in the 20% of self-identified Black patients with asthma bearing Arg16Arg of ADRB2, treatment with LABA/ICS is superior to use of a non-2-adrenergic bronchodilator combined with ICS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of this study will provide the information necessary to make evidence-based, individualized, recommendations concerning treatment algorithms and potential alternative treatment recommendations for the 3.5 million Blacks with asthma. The performance of this study in real life primary care settings will hasten the translation of these findings into day to day practice for this minority population that experiences a disproportionate burden of asthma and has been underrepresented in previous asthma studies.           The results of this study will provide the information necessary to make evidence-based, individualized, recommendations concerning treatment algorithms and potential alternative treatment recommendations for the 3.5 million Blacks with asthma.

"Intervention for Depressed Latina Mothers of Children with Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric asthma, the most common childhood chronic illness, remains a significant public health problem. Research indicates marked health care disparities in asthma, with Latino children at particular risk for poor health outcomes. Maternal depressive symptoms are also high among poor women who have children with asthma, and may compromise effective asthma management. The first AIM of this R21 application is to develop a manualized treatment to integrate asthma education with CBT strategies to reduce depressive symptoms among Latina mothers of children with persistent asthma. Such an intervention has the potential to improve asthma outcomes through increasing maternal knowledge and self-efficacy to manage asthma. During Year 1, Expert Consultants and an investigator team with expertise in asthma education, culturally tailored treatment, and CBT for Latinos will provide input into the development of the integrated intervention (MAADRE, for its acronym in Spanish). Focus groups will be conducted with our target population in Rhode Island and Puerto Rico to refine intervention content. Qualitative data analyses will be used to prioritize intervention targets and to identify contextual differences between Island and Mainland groups. The second AIM of this application is to conduct a small two-site pilot of the MAADRE intervention in Rhode Island and Puerto Rico. During Year 2, we will test the intervention with depressed mothers of children with asthma (32 in Puerto Rico and 32 in Rhode Island.) Mothers will be randomly assigned to receive either the MAADRE intervention or asthma education + child health (control). We expect that target children of participants in the MAADRE intervention will have improved asthma outcomes (asthma symptom days, lung function as measured by FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, asthma-related quality of life, and asthma control) relative to the control condition. We also anticipate that participants in the MAADRE intervention will have greater reduction in depressive symptoms and improved self-efficacy to manage asthma relative to the control condition. Findings from the proposed application will be used to design a larger RCT to evaluate the effects of the MAADRE intervention on asthma outcomes, and to compare cost-effectiveness of the intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is a common chronic illness in which minority children are disproportionately affected. A novel intervention that integrates asthma education with treatment for maternal depressive symptoms has great potential to improve outcomes for Latino children with asthma and their mothers.           Project Narrative: Asthma is a common chronic illness in which minority children are disproportionately affected.

"Development of a Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite higher levels of morbidity and mortality, African American children receive asthma care that is less consistent with national asthma guideline recommendations compared to white children. Access to care, insurance status and socioeconomic status have not fully explained these disparities. Poor assessments of asthma morbidity and suboptimal communication between physicians and parents of inner-city children with asthma may contribute racial disparities in quality of asthma care. We propose to examine the effects of an asthma-focused communication intervention on parent-physician communication and quality of asthma care among inner-city African American children. The objective of this project is to design, validate and implement an effective Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument (P-ACCI) within an innercity- based, university pediatric clinic. We therefore propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To develop and validate a simple, paper-and-pencil pediatric asthma control and communication instrument (P-ACCI) to serve as a both a prompt and a communication aide for the physician and the parent to discuss issues of asthma health; 2) To conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial in a primary care pediatric setting of inner-city African American children with asthma in order to assess the effects of the P-ACCI on the quality of patientphysician communication and quality of asthma care. We hypothesize that: 1) the P-ACCI is a valid measure of asthma morbidity; 2) regular use of the P-ACCI will improve the quality of parent-physician communication and the quality of asthma care for children. Relevance: There is a pressing need for simple, low-cost clinical strategies applicable in diverse settings to improve communication about variables important to asthma management. Such strategies would enhance clinical judgment, decision-making, and quality of asthma care. The current study will evaluate a novel, lowcost tool with the potential to reduce asthma care disparities related to poor parent-physician communication My career goals involve becoming a successful investigator of racial disparities in quality of asthma care, and to become a Professor of Pediatrics who develops remedies to improve asthma care through a multidisciplinary research center, and to reduce racial disparities in asthma care and asthma outcomes.

"Multimedia Asthma Self-Management Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airway, affecting more than 20 million Americans. Without proper management it can be life-threatening. Children aged 0-17 have the highest prevalence of asthma, impacting an estimated 8.9 million children. Racial disparities exist in asthma prevalence for children; African- American children are (a) the most likely to suffer from asthma, (b) three times more likely to be hospitalized, and (c) four times more likely to die from asthma than Euro-American children. Children with asthma report higher incidences of asthma attacks, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations than adults; these are all indicators of uncontrolled asthma. Along with the burden of the disease, children with asthma are more likely to exhibit anxiety and stress disorders and have lower school performance than their non-asthmatic peers. Missed school and work days add to the financial burden of the disease for parents. The goal of this proposal is to create an asthma self-management skills training program for children and their parents in Internet/CD-ROM and DVD formats. This behaviorally based program will emphasize increasing: (a) knowledge regarding asthma and proper use of medications, (b) motivation to use prevention methods effectively, (c) self-efficacy in managing asthma, and (d) compliance with health care provider directions. Content will be based on clinical practice guidelines (NHLBI) and will include: (a) understanding asthma, (b) preventing asthma attacks, and (c) creating an asthma management plan. Materials in the child program will be tailored to the three largest racial/ethnic groups impacted by asthma (Euro-American, African- American and Hispanic) to increase relevance and efficacy, and intended for viewing with a parent. A separate and more detailed program for parents will be created with additional materials for schools and care providers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential benefits of this research to public health include improved understanding of cultural factors in pediatric asthma self-management, improved self-management skills for children, and better asthma management skills for their parents. This could result in eased suffering and improved quality of life for millions of children and their families, and also reduce the economic burden borne by society in the forms of medical expenditures and lost productivity.           PROJECT NARRATIVE  The potential benefits of this research to public health include improved understanding of cultural factors in pediatric asthma self-management, improved self-management skills for children, and better asthma management skills for their parents.

"Whole Genome Analyses for Asthma in Latino Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, asthma prevalence is highest in Puerto Ricans (26%) and lowest in Mexicans (10%). This is paradoxical since both groups are considered ""Hispanic"" or ""Latino"". Although there are many potential explanations for this observation, including environmental and socioeconomic factors, one potential explanation is that the genetic predisposition to asthma differs among subgroups within the Latino population. Latinos are admixed and share varying proportions of African, Native American and European ancestry. The mixed ancestry of Latinos provides unique opportunities in epidemiological and genetic studies and may be useful in untangling complex gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in disease susceptibility. This proposal will take advantage of clinical data and genomic DNA on 2,100 Puerto Rican and 1,500 Mexican asthma cases and controls collected as part of two large studies of asthma in Latinos (GALA 1 and GALA 2). The goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide association analyses to identify genetic factors associated with asthma and related phenotypes in Puerto Ricans and Mexicans. In addition, potential interactions between these genetic factors and other genes and environmental variables will be investigated. Specifically, we will: 1) genotype Puerto Rican and Mexican asthma cases and controls using the Affymetrix state-of-art 500K GeneChip arrays, 2) perform genome-wide association analysis on 500K GeneChip data to identify SNPs associated with asthma, asthma severity and bronchodilator response. The analysis will include clinical and demographic characteristics, environmental factors and individual admixture estimates to correct for potential confounders. In addition, admixture mapping analysis will be performed to complement the genome-wide association analysis. Admixture mapping may identify novel regions that harbor racial/ethnic specific alleles for asthma and related phenotypes; and 3) fine map SNPs significantly associated with asthma and related phenotypes in genome-wide analyses (initial-hit SNPs). To our knowledge this is the first proposal to perform a genome-wide association analysis for asthma and related phenotypes in Latinos. Due to the size and scope of this project, the results of this study should substantially increase our understanding of the etiology of asthma and drug response. By gaining a better understanding of asthma risk factors in diverse populations, this proposal is consistent with the goals established by Healthy People 2010, which are to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population.           ",Whole Genome Analyses for Asthma in Latino Populations,7791353,R01HL088133,"['Testing ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' United States ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' Bronchodilator Agents ', ' lumen dilator ', ' Bronchodilators ', ' Bronchial-Dilating Agents ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' GALA ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' comparative genomics ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Ascaridil ', ' Trimisol ', ' Tramisol ', ' Solaskil ', ' Ketrax ', ' Immunol ', ' Ergamisole ', ' Ergamisol ', ' Decaris ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Map ', ' SNP Map ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Albuterol ', ' Ventolin ', ' Salbutamol ', ' Proventil ', ' 2-t-Butylamino-1-(4-hydroxy-3-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethyl)phenylethanol ', ' 1,3-Benzenedimethanol, alpha1-(((1,1-dimethylethyl)amino)methyl)-4-hydroxy- ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Mexican ', ' Sample Size ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Native Americans ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions, Nucleic Acid (Genetics) ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,776165,0.3444775116787472
"Faculty to Enhance Technology-Based Adolescent Asthma Health Disparity Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Pediatric Prevention Research Center, a Division of the Department of Pediatrics at Wayne State University (WSU), is a multidsicplinary group of faculty with a focus on behavioral interventions to reduce pediatric health disparities nationally and internationally. These efforts have included a focus on NHLBI diseases such as obesity and asthma in African American youth. Asthma exerts a high toll on minority children living in inner-city communities, especially adolescents. African-American adolescents not only have higher rates of asthma, but also experience more emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and fatalities from asthma than Caucasian adolescents. One factor that can account for mortality/morbidity in pediatric asthma is poor asthma management. Recently, several faculty have utilized technology to develop behavioral interventions to improve illness management for youth with HIV and diabetes. This RFA will allow Dr. Karen Kolmodin to transition to independent faculty status by September 1 with a focus on expanding technology based behavioral interventions to youth with asthma. This RFA fills a critical need to train the next generation of pediatric health disparity researchers. WSU is in a unique position to fill this need as we are located in Detroit, a city with the highest percentage of African Americans of major U.S. city (Census, 2000). The proposal has the potential to pave the way for continued hiring of workers in new technology based areas that are diversified from the beleaguered automotive industry as pilot projects give way to larger extramurally funded proposals. This proposal will create a synergy between a researcher transitioning to independent tenure-track faculty status and a division focused on reducing pediatric health disparities (""CORE CENTER"") to move the health disparities field fonward in the area of technology-based behavioral interventions to improve asthma management among minority adolescents and young adults.      This proposal will create a synergy between a researcher transitioning to independent tenure-track faculty status and a division focused on reducing pediatric health disparities (""CORE CENTER"") to move the health disparities field fon/vard in the area of technology-based behavioral interventions to improve asthma management among minority adolescents and young adults.             ",Faculty to Enhance Technology-Based Adolescent Asthma Health Disparity Research,7936175,P30HL101301,[''],NHLBI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,P30,2010,291601,0.2933498141407843
"Self-determination theory and caregiver smoking bans for asthmatic children    Description (provided by applicant): It is essential to know what motivates people to engage in health behaviors, especially when risks are great. Risks are great for children with asthma. Asthma is a chronic, debilitating, life-threatening, and costly disorder that disproportionately affects young, poor, and minority children, who must also rely on caregivers to meet their health care needs. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has created a strategic plan to address health disparities for asthma. In addition, the NHBLI coordinated an expert panel to develop national clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma. Despite these guidelines and advances in treatment, morbidity and mortality rates of pediatric asthma are not improving. Caregiver behavior may be a factor, particularly as it pertains to the control of asthma triggers like environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Self-determination theory (SDT) has been useful in predicting health behaviors in many contexts. According to SDT, persons persist in behaviors when they feel autonomously motivated (AM) for and perceive themselves to be competent (PC) about engaging in a particular behavior. Investigators have demonstrated that when clinicians support patients' autonomy and competence (are autonomy supportive; AS), behavior change is facilitated and health outcomes improved. SDT research to date, however, has focused on health behavior change for one's own sake (e.g. stopping smoking) while altruistic behavior change, for the primary benefit of others, has not been studied. Research to examine SDT as a theoretical framework consistent with the technique of motivational interviewing (Ml) is also new. Ml holds promise in assisting caregivers to adopt altruistic behaviors such as ETS control and is an intervention component of the larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) in which this cross-sectional, correlational study is nested. A sample of 304 caregivers of children with persistent asthma enrolled in a school-based medication program will be surveyed to address these specific aims: 1. To determine the role of AM and PC in predicting altruistic ETS control via caregiver smoking bans; 2. To describe the influence of autonomy support (AS) on SDT variables of behavior change for caregivers in the Ml intervention group; and 3. To determine the indirect relationships between AS, through AM and PC, and ETS control behavior among caregivers receiving Ml, if direct relationships are supported. Study findings will improve understanding of what motivates caregivers to keep smoke away from their children with asthma. This information will help to guide future research and interventions to reduce asthma burden, especially for families at greatest risk.          ",Self-determination theory and caregiver smoking bans for asthmatic children,7809576,F31NR011266,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Facilities and Administrative Costs ', ' Indirect Costs ', ' Process ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Family ', ' Killings ', ' Guidelines ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Literature ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Smoker ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Self Determination ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Adopted ', ' Attention ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' inner city ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Participant ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Reporting ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' Absenteeism ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Health behavior change ', ' person centered ', ' group intervention ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,F31,2010,26472,0.24946820240883882
"Multisystemic therapy to reduce health disparities in adolescents with asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common cause of hospitalization in children other than infections. The Health People 2000 initiative to reduce asthma hospitalizations was NOT met. Minority, inner city children, particularly adolescents, appear to be most at risk for high morbidity and mortality. Poor illness management is thought to be a primary driver of asthma morbidity and mortality. Yet, there are very few randomized controlled trials with inner city adolescents with asthma. Because of the complexity of asthma management and the associated barriers, intensive, multi-component interventions are needed to improve outcomes among those at highest risk. The investigators have adapted Multisystemic Therapy (MST), an innovative home- and community-based psychotherapy, to successfully improve treatment adherence and outcomes in urban pediatric medical populations. The objective of the present study is to utilize MST to improve asthma management and to reduce health care utilization (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) among high risk African American adolescents (ages 12-16) with moderate to severe persistent asthma. High risk is defined as having >=2 emergency department visits or >= 1 hospitalizations in 12 months). Additional aims are to determine the stability of MST's effects over a 12 month interval and to determine cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Families will be recruited from the only university-affiliated medical center in Detroit, Michigan. Detroit has the highest percentage of African Americans of any major city in the United States. The experimental design for the proposed study is a randomized controlled trial with 170 high risk African American adolescents with moderate to severe persistent asthma, 85 of whom will receive standard multidisciplinary specialty care (control condition) and 85 of whom will receive this care plus MST. Families will complete an initial data collection session (baseline), a 7-month post-test designed to coincide with treatment completion, and a subsequent post-test at 12 months after baseline. If successful, this intervention will provide immediate assistance to a vulnerable population disproportionately affected by asthma and may reduce costs of care for this high risk population. While asthma is the second most common cause of hospitalization in children, minority, inner city teens are at increased risk for complications from the disease. We are testing the effectiveness of an intervention for inner city African American teens with asthma using Multisystemic Therapy an intensive, home- and community-based psychotherapy. If successful, this intervention will improve asthma management and overall health, as well as reduce healthcare costs for this vulnerable population disproportionately affected by asthma.          ",Multisystemic therapy to reduce health disparities in adolescents with asthma,7870507,R01HL087272,"['Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Wolves ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' United States ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' Universities ', ' Urban Population ', ' Attention ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' inner city ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Censuses ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' severe behavior problem ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' successful intervention ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' treatment adherence ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Regimen ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Innovative Therapy ', ' Healthy People 2000 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Family psychotherapy ', ' Family Therapy ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Affect ', ' Secondary to ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Chronic ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' African ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Michigan ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Morbidity -

"Leukotriene Receptor Gene Variation and Atopic Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atopic asthma is a significant economic and public health problem in the world. The pathway of inflammation leading to atopic asthma is a complex process that includes leukotrienes, leukotriene receptors, eosinophils, and Immunoglobulin E (IgE). Evidence also indicates that over 50% of asthma cases are attributed to atopy and that this percentage is higher in males than females. The rate of asthma is increasing in children. Current treatment modalities are unable to adequately control atopic asthma in all patients. Evidence suggests that genetic variation in leukotriene receptors (CYSTLR1 and CYSTLR2) play a role in the expression of inflammation in atopic disease, airway dysfunction and remodeling in asthma, but most of these findings come from studies of homogenous populations outside the United States. To address this gap in knowledge, this genetic epidemiological research study program will explore whether CYSLTR1 and CYSLTR2 gene variations are associated with inflammatory markers of atopy, with atopic asthma, and with gender utilizing a candidate gene association approach of participants already enrolled in the longitudinal Tucson Epidemiological Study of Airway Obstructive Disease (TESAOD) program. TESAOD is comprised of 13 similar surveys and questionnaires including demographic, disease status, medication use, laboratory test results, pulmonary test results, and other biomarkers. The proposed study will include both secondary analysis of information from TESAOD as well as primary data collection of genetic variations through Taqman allele discrimination from extracted DNA from these participants. This traineeship and research is an opportunity to work with the principal investigator in TESAOD and a unique opportunity to research genetic variations in atopic asthma of up to 1,000 U.S. Caucasian participants enrolled in TESAOD. Applicant, sponsor, and co-sponsor are an excellent match for this study of atopic asthma, inflammation, and genetic variations. This research is in alignment with the National Institute of Health goal of fostering fundamental creative discoveries that extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. The goal of this research study and applicant's long term goal are also aligned with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Healthy People 2010 goal for respiratory disease to promote

"Comparison of Asthma Programs for Schools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Comparison of Asthma Programs for Schools (CAPS) study is to evaluate efficacy of a new developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling asthma health education program compared to a low-dose control, well-established, non-academic program. The new program for diverse fifth- grade students with asthma and their family caregivers is entitled, ""Staying Healthy Asthma Responsible & Prepared"" (SHARP). SHARP is a comprehensive, theory-driven, evidenced-guided program developed in collaboration with school personnel and members of one community asthma coalition that has two components: (a) a Student Component and (b) Community Component. The low-dose comparison group will receive Open Airways for Schools (OAS) that is widely disseminated through the American Lung Association. Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of SHARP compared to the low-dose OAS control group for fifth-grade students on cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral aspects of asthma management immediately post- and at 12 and 24 months post-intervention. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the long-term effect of SHARP compared to the low-dose OAS control group for fifth-grade students on condition characteristics, use of healthcare services, and quality of life at 12 and 24 months post intervention. A two-group, longitudinal, prospective, cluster- randomized, single-blinded trial will be used. Schools will be matched based on fifth-grade enrollment numbers, standardized reading and math scores, free/reduced lunch eligibility, and racial/ethnic proportions prior to randomization. The unit of analysis will be the student. The sample will consist of 2 cohorts of fifth- grade students, ages 9-12 years, with asthma and their caregivers. Two cohorts of student/caregiver dyads will be recruited over 2 years (N=152 dyads per year for a total of 304 dyads over two years) and analyzed separately. A minimum of 5-6 dyads will be recruited from 30 elementary schools located in three communities with 10 schools selected from each community. Participants will represent varying socioeconomic, cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. Recently retired certified elementary schoolteachers identified by the areas' school districts will be trained to serve as interveners to deliver SHARP or OAS during school hours. Evaluators will collect pre- and post-intervention data from dyads in the home using audio-linked data entry systems loaded on laptop computers at four time points. A bi-monthly automated voice recorded telephone survey will be placed to caregivers to monitor symptom days, medication use, use of healthcare services, and school absenteeism. To adjust for non-independence of observations within schools, hypotheses will be tested using the generalized estimating equations approach for categorical or ordinal variables and linear mixed models for continuous outcomes. After efficacy is demonstrated, this study would advance scientific knowledge through the offering of a comprehensive, developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling education program for older school age students with asthma that is not currently available. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nine million U.S. children under 18 years of age have been diagnosed with asthma at some point in their lives and approximately 4 million children have had an asthma episode in the last 12 months. This project seeks to compare efficacy of two school-based asthma education programs for fifth-grade students with asthma aimed at improving cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes; decreasing severity of illness; and improving quality of life. After efficacy is demonstrated, this study would advance scientific knowledge through the offering of a comprehensive, developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling education program for older school age students with asthma that is not currently available.             ",Comparison of Asthma Programs for Schools,7874553,R01NR010544,"['Counseling ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' American Lung Association ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Extended Family ', ' Behavioral ', ' Guidelines ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Hospitals ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Link ', ' Inhalators ', ' Inhaler ', ' Training ', ' Laws ', ' post intervention ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Fostering ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Single-Blind Study ', ' single-blind trial ', ' Michigan ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reading ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Sports ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Voice ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' respiratory ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Equation ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' laptop ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' fifth grade ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Friends ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Absenteeism ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' junior high school ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' comparison group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' prospective ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2010,458148,0.3960257574530354
"Vitamin D and Susceptibility to Inhaled Pollutants in Urban Children with Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project promises to be a rich training experience that will allow me to develop the skills necessary for clinical research. It achieves this through a combination of a rigorous research plan, relevant coursework, and supervised dedicated mentorship. Below is a summary of the research proposal. The urban minority pediatric population in the United States has a disproportionate burden of asthma. Several factors may contribute to this disparity, including high exposure to environmental pollutants and allergens, a poor diet, and other disadvantages of poverty. Recent attention has focused on the antioxidant and immune-modulatory role of vitamin D which may confer a protective effect on disease morbidity, and several clinical observational and cross-sectional studies support that low vitamin D levels may lead to greater allergic and asthma manifestations. Epidemiological studies, including our own preliminary investigations in Baltimore, have discovered that a significant proportion of African-American inner-city children with asthma have well below the recommended levels of serum vitamin D, and that, in these same children, indoor particulate matter (PM) is a significant cause of asthma morbidity. We therefore propose to determine whether lowerlevels of vitamin D, in such a highly-affected and vulnerable population, may increase their susceptibility to inhaled pollutants. To achieve this goal, we will nest this proposed study within an existing grant (The Center for Childhood Asthma in the Urban Environment DISCOVER # 1P50ES015903), which is currently recruiting 130 predominantly-black children with asthma, ages 5-12 years, in urban Baltimore to study the mechanisms by which air pollution induces lung inflammation and oxidative stress. This project proposal has three novel aims. First, to better understand the relationship between vitamin D levels and asthma health, we will be repeatedly measuring each subject' s serum vitamin D levels, daily asthma symptoms and medication use, and twice-daily lung function during 4 one-week periods in each season of the year. Second, to determine if varying levels of vitamin D modify the inflammatory response to air pollution, we will also be monitoring each child' s personal exposure to environmental PM throughout the day and simultaneously be measuring biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation present in blood, urine, and nasal lavage fluid. Finally, we will be collecting information regarding sun exposure, skin type, and dietary intake in order to assess the determinants of vitamin D status in this chronically low population, in preparation for future public health strategies directed towards improving asthma health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma attacks are particularly severe among urban African-American children and account for significant personal, economic, and social costs. Recent studies show that the majority of these children have low blood levels of vitamin D, and that the lower their levels, the worse their asthma symptoms seem to be. We would like to understand if low vitamin D levels put children at increased risk to be affected by common environmental triggers; if true, then improving their vitamin D status may ultimately protect urban minority children from a high burden of disease.           Project Narrative Asthma attacks are particularly severe among urban African-American children and account for significant personal, economic, and social costs.

"AsthmaNet:  Phenotypic Influences on Asthma Treatments     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Pittsburgh AsthmaNet proposal includes 3 protocols, with a 4th mechanistic protocol built around unmet asthma needs and phenotyping. These protocols should contribute to understanding asthma phenotypes in relation to mechanisms and specific treatment, particularly in relation to health disparities and contributions from race, socioeconomic status (SES) and asthma severity. These protocols build on our inherent expertise in asthma phenotyping and biology, racial/ethnic/socioeconomic issues, environmental effects, particularly in relation to underserved populations, psychosocial stress, and severe asthma. Our proposal includes participation from the Center for Minority Health with expertise in outreach in minority populations, a partner at Rainbow Babies of Case Western Reserve and a satellite at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. The 1st clinical trial will compare two approved drugs for treatment of the adult onset asthma phenotype, which hypothesizes that a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor will be more effective than a leukotriene receptor antagonist. The 2nd study evaluates the role of race in relation to SES on corticosteroid (CS) responses in children, h3TJ0thesizing that the African-American asthma phenotype, with and without regard to SES, predicts a poor response to inhaled CSs in asthmatic children. Vitamin D supplementation will overcome the poor response and improve outcomes. We will recruit African American and Caucasian children stratified by race and SES. Children who remain symptomatic following initial stabilization will be treated with high dose ICS and response determined. Children of all groups who do not improve will be randomized to treatment with Vitamin D or higher ICS dose to determine whether Vitamin D + lower dose ICS improves exacerbations and CS responsiveness better or to the same degree than the higher dose ICS. The mechanistic ancillary protocol will address whether aspects of CS unresponsiveness can be modeled in vitro, including effects of race/SES factors on cytokine suppression and histones, and the effect of Vitamin D to improve them. Finally, the severe asthma protocol will focus on the mast cell, specifically prostaglandin D2 and its interaction with CRTH2. We believe these studies address unmet needs in asthma and will improve its therapy.           ",AsthmaNet:  Phenotypic Influences on Asthma Treatments,7936257,U10HL098177,"['Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Prostaglandin D2 ', ' Prosta-5,13-dien-1-oic acid, 9,15-dihydroxy-11-oxo-, (5Z,9alpha,13E,15S)- ', ' PGD2 ', ' 11-Dehydroprostaglandin F2alpha ', ' 11-Dehydroprostaglandin F2 alpha ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase ', ' Leukotriene A4 Synthetase ', ' Leukotriene A4 Synthase ', ' Leukotriene A Synthase ', ' LTA4 Synthase ', ' Arachidonic Acid 5-Lipoxygenase ', ' 5-Lipoxygenase ', ' programs ', ' Sputum ', ' Time ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Aspirin ', ' Measurin ', ' Extren ', ' Entericin ', ' Empirin ', ' Ecotrin ', ' Aspergum ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' 2-(Acetyloxy)benzoic Acid ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Universities ', ' Upper Respiratory Infections ', ' Upper Respiratory Tract Infection ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Biology ', ' Leukotriene Antagonists ', ' Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' Bronchodilator Agents ', ' lumen dilator ', ' Bronchodilators ', ' Bronchial-Dilating Agents ', ' outreach ', ' Allergic ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Zileuton ', ' N-(1-benzo(b)thien-2-ylethyl)-N-hydroxyurea ', ' Lipoxygenase Inhibitors ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' response ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' chronic rhinosinusitis ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' response marker ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Leukotriene E4 ', ' Leukotriene E-4 ', ' LTE4 ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Eicosanoids ', ' Address ', ' Enzymes ', ' Dose ', ' eosinophil ', ' eosinocyte ', ' Marrow Eosinophil ', ' Eosinophilic Leukocyte ', ' Eosinophilic Granulocyte ', ' Blood Eosinophil ', ' Acidophilic Leukocyte ', ' Cytokine Suppression ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Supplementation ', ' in vitro Model ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' minority health ', ' Histones ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Leukotrienes ', ' Leukotriene B4 ', ' Leukotriene B-4 ', ' LTB4 ', ' Liver Function Tests ', ' Inflammation Mediators ', ' inflammatory mediator ', ' Agonist ', ' mast cell ', ' mastocyte ', ' Tissue Basophils ', ' Marrow Mast Cell ', ' Basophilic Histiocyte ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' neutrophil ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Polymorph ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Heterophil Granulocyte ', ' Blood Segmented Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' montelukast ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U10,2010,905848,0.312300766736389
"Admixture mapping in African American Asthmatic Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: The candidate is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics in the Divisions of Asthma Research at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati. Upon completion of his quantitative genetics training, the candidate pursed statistical and human genetics fellowship programs at the University of Alabama Section on Statistical Genetics and the Human Genetics Center of Medical College of Wisconsin. These projects have been published in peer-review journals. Dr. Baye's overall research interest includes the use of quantitative and statistical genetics methods to dissect complex diseases particularly asthma and asthma-related allergy disorders. The long-term goals are to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality associated with asthma. Environment: At the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical center, the applicant will work with a highly collaborative multidisciplinary research team and will be fostered in an excellent academic environment offering outstanding educational programs for junior faculty members. The institution, through the Divisions of Asthma Research, Asthma Center, Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Biomedical Informatics and the Genetic Variation and Gene Discovery Core, provides all resources and facilities that are needed for the applicant's proposed research and is providing full access to all necessary resources to the applicant. The applicant will be provided 90% protected time to conduct the research proposed in this application. Research: This project aims to develop a program of study that would lead to an in depth understanding of the genome of African American (AA) admixed populations and develop procedures and methods for utilizing this information and SNP markers for linkage disequilibrium admixture mapping to localize asthma liability genes. The burden of asthma is disproportionately high among individuals of African descent. Due to recent admixture, AAs have a mixed parental genome contribution, with an average ratio of 80:20 for the proportion from African descent and European descent. This generates linkage disequilibrium (LD) among alleles on all chromosomes, which is detectable even at substantial distances (20-30 cM) using Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs). We plan to develop methods to exploit this LD that span along the genomes of AAs with asthma, in search for specific regions of unusually high African or European ancestry, thereby identifying the chromosomal segments that are likely to contain genes that are related to the disease liability. To achieve these goals, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) Investigate the genome of African American admixed population using our recently developed ancestry informative markers (Baye et al., 2009); 2) Estimate admixture proportions and evaluate differences between asthma cases and controls; 3) Apply these procedures to investigate whether genetic ancestral background at the 5q31 region is associated with asthma outcome measures. Hence, genotypic data from HapMap, Perlegen datasets and Greater Cincinnati Pediatric Clinic Cohort will be used to test the approach and enhance our ability to map asthma liability genes. Implications: This career development plan will foster Dr. Baye's development into an established independent expertise in complex disease and asthma genetics. The research will improve mapping of loci affecting complex traits in admixed populations, ultimately improving elucidation of the genetic architecture of complex human diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of asthma is disproportionately high among individuals of ethnic minorities. This project aims to develop procedures and methods for utilize the genome of admixed African American populations to localize asthma liability genes by modeling individual estimates of genetic admixture and socioeconomic status on measures of asthma. By gaining a better understanding of asthma risk factors in admixed minority populations, this proposal is consistent with the goals established by Healthy People 2010, which are to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population.

"Genetic Susceptibility to Asthma and IndoorAir Pollution in Peru    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is an epidemic that disproportionately affects children, the poor and certain racial/ethnic groups. Latinos/Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the US and are disproportionately affected by asthma morbidity. From 1990 to 2000 there was an 81 percent increase in number of people that mark their ethnic origin as Peruvian on the US Census survey and the prevalence of asthma in Peru is among one of the highest in the world. Asthma is a complex disease and genetic risk for asthma and asthma morbidity may be modified by environmental exposures. The indoor environment is of particular concern as most people spend the majority of their time indoors. Investigators in this application have shown that high levels of indoor exposures, including particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), are independently associated with greater asthma morbidity, and are particularly high in Peruvian homes. The burden of asthma attributable to differences in domestic PM and NO2 concentrations is substantial; however, not all children are susceptible to effects of pollutant exposure and a large variation in response exists between individuals. These findings suggest a strong possibility of an interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental exposure in the development of asthma. To address the critical questions of the role of genetic susceptibility to the adverse effects of indoor air pollution on asthma, we will build upon the infrastructure and ongoing data collection efforts in Peru. We propose a candidate gene study to identify genetic variants associated with asthma and its associated traits (i.e., asthma severity, pulmonary function, airway inflammation) in relation to indoor air pollutant exposure in two Peruvian cities, Lima and Tumbes. We will prioritize candidate genes identified by published genome-wide association studies for asthma as well as those in the oxidative stress pathway thought to be relevant to pollutant exposure and asthma. We will cross-validate associations identified in well characterized asthma cases and controls from Lima, Peru (n=1,400), in a second independent population of asthmatic cases and controls recruited from Tumbes, Peru (n=400). Specific Aim #1: To identify genes associated with asthma in children in Peru. Specific Aim #2: To determine if genetic risk for asthma is modified by indoor air pollutant (PM, NO2) concentrations. We anticipate identifying candidate genes for asthma and associated traits relevant to both the general population as well as those contributing to disparities in asthma morbidity among individuals in Peru. Identifying subgroups of the population who are particularly vulnerable to air pollution is an important objective, as the results can be used to identify people most likely to benefit from exposure avoidance.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and over 300 million people suffer from asthma worldwide, suggesting a large public health burden.

"AsthmaNet:  Phenotypic Influences on Asthma Treatments     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Pittsburgh AsthmaNet proposal includes 3 protocols, with a 4th mechanistic protocol built around unmet asthma needs and phenotyping. These protocols should contribute to understanding asthma phenotypes in relation to mechanisms and specific treatment, particularly in relation to health disparities and contributions from race, socioeconomic status (SES) and asthma severity. These protocols build on our inherent expertise in asthma phenotyping and biology, racial/ethnic/socioeconomic issues, environmental effects, particularly in relation to underserved populations, psychosocial stress, and severe asthma. Our proposal includes participation from the Center for Minority Health with expertise in outreach in minority populations, a partner at Rainbow Babies of Case Western Reserve and a satellite at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. The 1st clinical trial will compare two approved drugs for treatment of the adult onset asthma phenotype, which hypothesizes that a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor will be more effective than a leukotriene receptor antagonist. The 2nd study evaluates the role of race in relation to SES on corticosteroid (CS) responses in children, h3TJ0thesizing that the African-American asthma phenotype, with and without regard to SES, predicts a poor response to inhaled CSs in asthmatic children. Vitamin D supplementation will overcome the poor response and improve outcomes. We will recruit African American and Caucasian children stratified by race and SES. Children who remain symptomatic following initial stabilization will be treated with high dose ICS and response determined. Children of all groups who do not improve will be randomized to treatment with Vitamin D or higher ICS dose to determine whether Vitamin D + lower dose ICS improves exacerbations and CS responsiveness better or to the same degree than the higher dose ICS. The mechanistic ancillary protocol will address whether aspects of CS unresponsiveness can be modeled in vitro, including effects of race/SES factors on cytokine suppression and histones, and the effect of Vitamin D to improve them. Finally, the severe asthma protocol will focus on the mast cell, specifically prostaglandin D2 and its interaction with CRTH2. We believe these studies address unmet needs in asthma and will improve its therapy.           ",AsthmaNet:  Phenotypic Influences on Asthma Treatments,8103973,U10HL098177,"['Allergic ', ' General Hospitals ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Histones ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Caucasians ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' neutrophil ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Polymorph ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Heterophil Granulocyte ', ' Blood Segmented Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Supplementation ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' eosinophil ', ' eosinocyte ', ' Marrow Eosinophil ', ' Eosinophilic Leukocyte ', ' Eosinophilic Granulocyte ', ' Blood Eosinophil ', ' Acidophilic Leukocyte ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Sputum ', ' comparative ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Clinical ', ' Genetic ', ' Phase ', ' Inflammation Mediators ', ' inflammatory mediator ', ' outreach ', ' Dose ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Time ', ' Enzymes ', ' response marker ', ' Running ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Biology ', ' Safety ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' primary outcome ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Address ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' response ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Parents ', ' Inflammation ', ' Measures ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Agonist ', ' Population ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Universities ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' improved ', ' programs ', ' Acute ', ' Patients ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' Phenotype ', ' Leukotriene B4 ', ' Leukotriene B-4 ', ' LTB4 ', ' Age ', ' Outcome ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Work ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Pattern ', ' Incidence ', ' Severities ', ' Upper Respiratory Infections ', ' Upper Respiratory Tract Infection ', ' Aspirin ', ' Measurin ', ' Extren ', ' Entericin ', ' Empirin ', ' Ecotrin ', ' Aspergum ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' 2-(Acetyloxy)benzoic Acid ', ' Bronchodilator Agents ', ' lumen dilator ', ' Bronchodilators ', ' Bronchial-Dilating Agents ', ' Zileuton ', ' N-(1-benzo(b)thien-2-ylethyl)-N-hydroxyurea ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' Leukotrienes ', ' Leukotriene E4 ', ' Leukotriene E-4 ', ' LTE4 ', ' Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase ', ' Leukotriene A4 Synthetase ', ' Leukotriene A4 Synthase ', ' Leukotriene A Synthase ', ' LTA4 Synthase ', ' Arachidonic Acid 5-Lipoxygenase ', ' 5-Lipoxygenase ', ' Eicosanoids ', ' mast cell ', ' mastocyte ', ' Tissue Basophils ', ' Marrow Mast Cell ', ' Basophilic Histiocyte ', ' montelukast ', ' Cytokine Suppression ', ' Lipoxygenase Inhibitors ', ' chronic rhinosinusitis ', ' minority health ', ' Liver Function Tests ', ' Leukotriene Antagonists ', ' Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists ', ' Prostaglandin D2 ', ' Prosta-5,13-dien-1-oic acid, 9,15-dihydroxy-11-oxo-, (5Z,9alpha,13E,15S)- ', ' PGD2 ', ' 11-Dehydroprostaglandin F2alpha ', ' 11-Dehydroprostaglandin F2 alpha ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U10,2011,857131,0.312300766736389
"Promoting Asthma Wellness in Rural Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma, the most common chronic disorder in childhood, disproportionately affects African-Americans (AAs) with both greater morbidity and mortality. AA male youth suffer death rates from asthma that are six times greater than for white male youth of the same age. Among triggers for asthma, tobacco use and passive smoke exposure are considered among the most adverse. Nearly 6.4 million youth living today will die prematurely from tobacco attributable diseases. The higher level of morbidity and mortality among AA youth, at times related to tobacco exposure, emphasize the need for new methods for reaching these youth. With NHLBI funding (HL68971) a culturally sensitive, web-based intervention, termed ""Puff City,"" was developed based on: Motivational Theory, tailoring of information, essential asthma management skills, and entertainment. When this program was evaluated among predominately AA youth attending a Midwestern, urban school system (Detroit Public Schools) promising results (i.e. fewer emergency department visits, fewer hospitalizations, improved quality of life scores, and reduced number of school days missed) were found. The cost of delivering the program was $6.67 per student. Given the initial success of Puff City among the Detroit youth, an important question is whether this intervention will be effective among AA youth living in the rural south: a different cultural, social, and climatic environment. This application seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of the Puff City program in 9th-11th grade, southern, rural youth (N=300) using a randomized, two-group design with repeated measures. Youth randomized to the treatment group will receive the Puff City program and those in the control group will receive equal web-based time on websites that provide education on asthma and tobacco risks. The Puff City intervention consists of four, 30 minute, modules that target three key asthma management issues: reduction of tobacco exposure (i.e. smoking and passive smoke exposure), controller medication adherence, and attack readiness (i.e. carrying a rescue inhaler at all times). Behavioral change will be evaluated by self-report at baseline, end of treatment (short-term), and at six and 12 months follow up (long-term) and also via salivary cotinine and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) at the same time points. The Puff City program is expected to foster the development of personal motivational factors that will result in improved asthma management in all three target areas. The primary hypotheses are: Youth in the treatment arm will have improved behavioral outcomes of: 1) a decrease in passive smoke exposure; 2) greater controller medication adherence; and 3) greater attack readiness. The secondary hypotheses are that treated youth when compared to control youth will also have reduced levels of salivary cotinine and eNO, and a decrease in active smoking. Cross-study comparative analyses will also be performed between the rural South and urban Midwestern youth populations. Consistent with the mission of the NHLBI, this application targets the advancement of socio-cultural behavioral treatments for preventing further asthma and tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and the elimination of health disparities observed for an ethnic minority-AAs. If effective, implementation of this culturally tailored and cost effective approach via school systems as the primary point of entry is highly probable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research addresses two significant public health concerns, asthma and tobacco use in a largely neglected population, African American youth living in a rural area. There is evidence to suggest that both of these health issues can be effectively addressed using a culturally sensitive, cost effective, web-based, self-tailoring, computer program.              Project Narrative and Public Health Significance This research addresses two significant public health concerns, asthma and tobacco use in a largely neglected population, African American youth living in a rural area.

"Comparison of Asthma Programs for Schools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Comparison of Asthma Programs for Schools (CAPS) study is to evaluate efficacy of a new developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling asthma health education program compared to a low-dose control, well-established, non-academic program. The new program for diverse fifth- grade students with asthma and their family caregivers is entitled, ""Staying Healthy Asthma Responsible & Prepared"" (SHARP). SHARP is a comprehensive, theory-driven, evidenced-guided program developed in collaboration with school personnel and members of one community asthma coalition that has two components: (a) a Student Component and (b) Community Component. The low-dose comparison group will receive Open Airways for Schools (OAS) that is widely disseminated through the American Lung Association. Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of SHARP compared to the low-dose OAS control group for fifth-grade students on cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral aspects of asthma management immediately post- and at 12 and 24 months post-intervention. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the long-term effect of SHARP compared to the low-dose OAS control group for fifth-grade students on condition characteristics, use of healthcare services, and quality of life at 12 and 24 months post intervention. A two-group, longitudinal, prospective, cluster- randomized, single-blinded trial will be used. Schools will be matched based on fifth-grade enrollment numbers, standardized reading and math scores, free/reduced lunch eligibility, and racial/ethnic proportions prior to randomization. The unit of analysis will be the student. The sample will consist of 2 cohorts of fifth- grade students, ages 9-12 years, with asthma and their caregivers. Two cohorts of student/caregiver dyads will be recruited over 2 years (N=152 dyads per year for a total of 304 dyads over two years) and analyzed separately. A minimum of 5-6 dyads will be recruited from 30 elementary schools located in three communities with 10 schools selected from each community. Participants will represent varying socioeconomic, cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. Recently retired certified elementary schoolteachers identified by the areas' school districts will be trained to serve as interveners to deliver SHARP or OAS during school hours. Evaluators will collect pre- and post-intervention data from dyads in the home using audio-linked data entry systems loaded on laptop computers at four time points. A bi-monthly automated voice recorded telephone survey will be placed to caregivers to monitor symptom days, medication use, use of healthcare services, and school absenteeism. To adjust for non-independence of observations within schools, hypotheses will be tested using the generalized estimating equations approach for categorical or ordinal variables and linear mixed models for continuous outcomes. After efficacy is demonstrated, this study would advance scientific knowledge through the offering of a comprehensive, developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling education program for older school age students with asthma that is not currently available. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nine million U.S. children under 18 years of age have been diagnosed with asthma at some point in their lives and approximately 4 million children have had an asthma episode in the last 12 months. This project seeks to compare efficacy of two school-based asthma education programs for fifth-grade students with asthma aimed at improving cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes; decreasing severity of illness; and improving quality of life.

"Reducing Asthma Disparities Through School-Based Telemedicine for Rural Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma disproportionately burdens minority and low-income pediatric populations, and these disparities have persisted among high-risk children despite the dissemination of NHLBI asthma management guidelines more than a decade ago. Previous investigations suggest that asthma guidelines-based care has not translated to high-risk children living in rural regions. Asthma-related morbidity and non-adherence to asthma guidelines is prevalent among high-risk rural children living in the Mississippi Delta region of Arkansas, an impoverished and medically underserved region of the United States. Large-scale interventions to decrease asthma burden among high-risk rural children have not been designed, and interventions designed for other populations are not feasible due to distance and travel barriers and lack of subspecialty asthma services inherent to rural communities. The overall goal of the proposed project is to decrease asthma health outcomes disparities among high-risk children living in a rural, medically underserved environment. To address this goal, we propose conducting a cluster randomized trial with 540 children, ages 4-17 years, to implement a school-based telemedicine intervention in rural public school districts. The school-based intervention will provide comprehensive asthma education via telemedicine to rural children with asthma, their caregivers and school nurses; prospectively monitor asthma symptoms and lung function via telemedicine; and provide primary care providers with treatment prompts according to nationally published asthma guidelines. We hypothesize that children receiving school-based asthma education and monitoring via telemedicine in conjunction with a provider treatment prompt will have decreased asthma-related morbidity as compared to children receiving usual care. The aims of the project will: 1) examine the efficacy of a school-based asthma telemedicine intervention in improving asthma-related health outcomes in an intervention group compared to a usual care group; 2) examine the effects of a school-based asthma telemedicine intervention on asthma self-management skills; and 3) determine the cost of the intervention. Telemedicine will allow for the utilization of proven technology to deliver a state-of-the-art asthma intervention in a high-risk population and will significantly reduce challenges associated with distance and travel barriers inherent to rural communities. An innovative telemedicine approach to improve asthma health outcomes among high-risk rural children has high impact potential because findings from the proposed intervention will directly inform public health strategies to implement large-scale telemedicine services in a school-based setting. The intervention will have direct applicability to other high-risk asthma populations in rural and medically underserved regions and can be translated to school-based health intervention strategies to target other chronic health conditions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project may have a profound impact on public health because it presents a practical school-based intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines. Should it prove successful in reducing symptoms and improving the health of rural children with asthma, it has the potential to serve as a model for improved asthma care in other medically underserved communities.           NARR ATIVE - RELEVANCE This project may have a profound impact on public health because it presents a practical school-based intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines.

"Leukotriene Receptor Gene Variation and Atopic Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atopic asthma is a significant economic and public health problem in the world. The pathway of inflammation leading to atopic asthma is a complex process that includes leukotrienes, leukotriene receptors, eosinophils, and Immunoglobulin E (IgE). Evidence also indicates that over 50% of asthma cases are attributed to atopy and that this percentage is higher in males than females. The rate of asthma is increasing in children. Current treatment modalities are unable to adequately control atopic asthma in all patients. Evidence suggests that genetic variation in leukotriene receptors (CYSTLR1 and CYSTLR2) play a role in the expression of inflammation in atopic disease, airway dysfunction and remodeling in asthma, but most of these findings come from studies of homogenous populations outside the United States. To address this gap in knowledge, this genetic epidemiological research study program will explore whether CYSLTR1 and CYSLTR2 gene variations are associated with inflammatory markers of atopy, with atopic asthma, and with gender utilizing a candidate gene association approach of participants already enrolled in the longitudinal Tucson Epidemiological Study of Airway Obstructive Disease (TESAOD) program. TESAOD is comprised of 13 similar surveys and questionnaires including demographic, disease status, medication use, laboratory test results, pulmonary test results, and other biomarkers. The proposed study will include both secondary analysis of information from TESAOD as well as primary data collection of genetic variations through Taqman allele discrimination from extracted DNA from these participants. This traineeship and research is an opportunity to work with the principal investigator in TESAOD and a unique opportunity to research genetic variations in atopic asthma of up to 1,000 U.S. Caucasian participants enrolled in TESAOD. Applicant, sponsor, and co-sponsor are an excellent match for this study of atopic asthma, inflammation, and genetic variations. This research is in alignment with the National Institute of Health goal of fostering fundamental creative discoveries that extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. The goal of this research study and applicant's long term goal are also aligned with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Healthy People 2010 goal for respiratory disease to promote respiratory health through better prevention, detection, treatment, and education efforts.       Understanding the pathology and genetic etiology of atopic asthma through this research will help translate genomic research from bench to bedside and contribute to innovative tailored preventive strategies, diagnostic tools, and therapies for those suffering from atopic asthma.

"Whole Genome Analyses for Asthma in Latino Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, asthma prevalence is highest in Puerto Ricans (26%) and lowest in Mexicans (10%). This is paradoxical since both groups are considered ""Hispanic"" or ""Latino"". Although there are many potential explanations for this observation, including environmental and socioeconomic factors, one potential explanation is that the genetic predisposition to asthma differs among subgroups within the Latino population. Latinos are admixed and share varying proportions of African, Native American and European ancestry. The mixed ancestry of Latinos provides unique opportunities in epidemiological and genetic studies and may be useful in untangling complex gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in disease susceptibility. This proposal will take advantage of clinical data and genomic DNA on 2,100 Puerto Rican and 1,500 Mexican asthma cases and controls collected as part of two large studies of asthma in Latinos (GALA 1 and GALA 2). The goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide association analyses to identify genetic factors associated with asthma and related phenotypes in Puerto Ricans and Mexicans. In addition, potential interactions between these genetic factors and other genes and environmental variables will be investigated. Specifically, we will: 1) genotype Puerto Rican and Mexican asthma cases and controls using the Affymetrix state-of-art 500K GeneChip arrays, 2) perform genome-wide association analysis on 500K GeneChip data to identify SNPs associated with asthma, asthma severity and bronchodilator response. The analysis will include clinical and demographic characteristics, environmental factors and individual admixture estimates to correct for potential confounders. In addition, admixture mapping analysis will be performed to complement the genome-wide association analysis. Admixture mapping may identify novel regions that harbor racial/ethnic specific alleles for asthma and related phenotypes; and 3) fine map SNPs significantly associated with asthma and related phenotypes in genome-wide analyses (initial-hit SNPs). To our knowledge this is the first proposal to perform a genome-wide association analysis for asthma and related phenotypes in Latinos. Due to the size and scope of this project, the results of this study should substantially increase our understanding of the etiology of asthma and drug response. By gaining a better understanding of asthma risk factors in diverse populations, this proposal is consistent with the goals established by Healthy People 2010, which are to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population.           ",Whole Genome Analyses for Asthma in Latino Populations,8039187,R01HL088133,"['Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Ascaridil ', ' Trimisol ', ' Tramisol ', ' Solaskil ', ' Ketrax ', ' Immunol ', ' Ergamisole ', ' Ergamisol ', ' Decaris ', ' Arts ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' comparative genomics ', ' GALA ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions, Nucleic Acid (Genetics) ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' Latino ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Map ', ' SNP Map ', ' European ', ' Bronchodilator Agents ', ' lumen dilator ', ' Bronchodilators ', ' Bronchial-Dilating Agents ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Albuterol ', ' Ventolin ', ' Salbutamol ', ' Proventil ', ' 2-t-Butylamino-1-(4-hydroxy-3-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethyl)phenylethanol ', ' 1,3-Benzenedimethanol, alpha1-(((1,1-dimethylethyl)amino)methyl)-4-hydroxy- ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Admixture ', ' programs ', ' United States ', ' Goals ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Genotype ', ' response ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Subgroup ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Prevalence ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Parents ', ' Severities ', ' Population ', ' Genes ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Testing ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Genomics ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Sample Size ', ' Clinical ', ' Maps ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Methods ', ' novel ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Complex ', ' Native Americans ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Data ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Genome ', ' Risk ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' African ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' case control ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2011,738008,0.3444775116787472
"Multimedia Asthma Self-Management Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airway, affecting more than 20 million Americans. Without proper management it can be life-threatening. Children aged 0-17 have the highest prevalence of asthma, impacting an estimated 8.9 million children. Racial disparities exist in asthma prevalence for children; African- American children are (a) the most likely to suffer from asthma, (b) three times more likely to be hospitalized, and (c) four times more likely to die from asthma than Euro-American children. Children with asthma report higher incidences of asthma attacks, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations than adults; these are all indicators of uncontrolled asthma. Along with the burden of the disease, children with asthma are more likely to exhibit anxiety and stress disorders and have lower school performance than their non-asthmatic peers. Missed school and work days add to the financial burden of the disease for parents. The goal of this proposal is to create an asthma self-management skills training program for children and their parents in Internet/CD-ROM and DVD formats. This behaviorally based program will emphasize increasing: (a) knowledge regarding asthma and proper use of medications, (b) motivation to use prevention methods effectively, (c) self-efficacy in managing asthma, and (d) compliance with health care provider directions. Content will be based on clinical practice guidelines (NHLBI) and will include: (a) understanding asthma, (b) preventing asthma attacks, and (c) creating an asthma management plan. Materials in the child program will be tailored to the three largest racial/ethnic groups impacted by asthma (Euro-American, African- American and Hispanic) to increase relevance and efficacy, and intended for viewing with a parent. A separate and more detailed program for parents will be created with additional materials for schools and care providers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential benefits of this research to public health include improved understanding of cultural factors in pediatric asthma self-management, improved self-management skills for children, and better asthma management skills for their parents. This could result in eased suffering and improved quality of life for millions of children and their families, and also reduce the economic burden borne by society in the forms of medical expenditures and lost productivity.           PROJECT NARRATIVE  The potential benefits of this research to public health include improved understanding of cultural factors in pediatric asthma self-management, improved self-management skills for children, and better asthma management skills for their parents.

"Asthma Management and Ethnic Disparities at the Adolescent Transition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised K24 application proposes a mentorship program in patient-oriented research in pediatric asthma, with a specific focus on health care disparities and disease management behaviors. The K24 Candidate is an Associate Professor (Research) in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior of the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, with a history of funding in behavioral interventions to improve disease management and address health disparities in pediatric asthma. Training Plan: The candidate will obtain additional training in longitudinal data analysis, behavioral genetics, evaluation and assessment in health education, and health care access for Latino immigrants to enrich her skills and mentoring capacity in future health care disparities research. Research Plan: A longitudinal study of medication adherence for Latinos and non-Latino white (NLW) youth with asthma is proposed to assess the differential course of medication adherence by culture across the transition to adolescence. Three waves of 50 youth with persistent asthma (150 total, 25 Latino, 25 NLW in each wave) will complete a multimethod assessment of asthma status, family factors, medication beliefs, and controller medication use. Assessments will occur in eighth grade, then again in tenth grade, with continuous monitoring of medication adherence throughout. Analyses will evaluate the role of medication beliefs and family connectedness in supporting asthma management in Latino and NLW youth with persistent asthma, and assess differential trajectories of medication use by ethnic group over time. Mentoring Plan: The proposed mentoring plan offers participation in an RCT to address asthma disparities in medication use, access to an ongoing educational program for asthma that serves over 700 families a year, and an archival dataset that includes a wealth of data on disease management behavior in over 800 Latino and NLW children in Rl and Puerto Rico. An additional ongoing seminar is planned for junior faculty on topics such as recruiting and retaining culturally diverse samples, and preparing research grant applications. This overall plan capitalizes on the rich resources and training opportunities available to postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty at Brown, including seven T32 fellowship programs, numerous junior faculty with K awards and small grants, seminars in research design, ethics, and statistics, and established infrastructure for evaluation.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public Health Significance: Asthma is a common chronic illness in which minority children are disproportionately affected.

"Literacy and improving patient-clinician encounters for Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Low literacy is widespread and particularly prevalent among low-income and minority groups, the same groups in which asthma morbidity is excessive. Inattention by clinicians to the literacy and related health literacy of patients may result in ineffective communication and subsequent poor patient self-management. Some aspects of health literacy such as understanding numerical concepts may be particularly important. We recently developed and validated an asthma-specific numeracy questionnaire (ANQ). We found that many adults do not understand the numerical concepts embedded in standard asthma education. Those with low ANQ scores were also more likely to have had hospitalizations and ED visits for asthma. The initial aims of this application are to use the participants and outcomes of the parent R01 HL073932 to conduct a cohort study to examine the association of (Specific Aim 1) a standard health literacy instrument and (Specific   Aim 2) ANQ with adherence to inhaled steroids (measured electronically), asthma control (FEV1), and asthma-related quality of life in adults with moderate or severe asthma. The parent R01 HL073932 addresses another barrier to successful asthma care involving patient-clinician interaction. It is a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of a behavioral individualized intervention, problem-solving (PS) with standard asthma education (Attention Control (AC)), on these same outcomes. PS seeks to empower lowincome and minority asthmatic adults and allows clinicians to take account of the social context of these patients' lives. Exploratory Aim 3 will examine the interaction between literacy and PS versus AC interventions. We will use focus groups of patients and clinicians to refine the ANQ as a brief individualized assessment for clinicians. We will then develop and pilot an intervention to test whether ANQ-based individualized interventions result in improved adherence and asthma outcomes (Specific Aim 4). This will lead to subsequent research applications to test whether ANQ-based interventions alone or combined with   PS results in better asthma outcomes and adherence. That is, we anticipate that both PS and ANQ will lead to simple brief additive or synergistic ways for clinicians to assess patients and tailor information. My Overarching Research Goal is examine barriers to asthma care that operate at the interface between patient and clinician and that may differentially affect members of ethnic and racial minority groups with my ultimate goal being to design and implement ways to reduce such health disparities. This K02 application will allow me to continue along my current trajectory to become an independent investigator focusing on strategies directed at both clinicians and patients. By enhancing current collaborations, building others, and participating in relevant research working groups, I will create a team of expert collaborators in health and literacy, education, bioenqineerinq (directed at behavior measurement), and behavioral medicine        (End of Abstract)          ",Literacy and improving patient-clinician encounters for Asthma,8069243,K02HL088469,"['Language ', ' Motivation ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' inattention ', ' inattentiveness ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Steroids ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' patient population ', ' Population Study ', ' skills ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Visit ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Solutions ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Attitude ', ' instrument ', ' American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Latino ', ' Affect ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Clinic ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Minority ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' cohort ', ' member ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Economics ', ' Communication ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' abstracting ', ' Chronic ', ' Prevalence ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Clinical ', ' Accounting ', ' Testing ', ' Outcome ', ' Patients ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Research ', ' Caring ', ' Risk ', ' Parents ', ' Electronics ', ' Goals ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Monitor ', ' Work ', ' Data ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Address ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Health ', ' Life ', ' improved ', ' Measures ', ' Knowledge ', ' Time ', ' Participant ', ' Attention ', ' Funding ', ' base ', ' programs ', ' Self Management ', ' health literacy ', ' Collaborations ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight control ', ' working group ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' pill (pharmacologic) ', ' Pill ', ' Powder dose form ', ' Powders ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Inhalators ', ' Inhaler ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' Low income ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Prednisone ', ' delta-Cortisone ', ' Prednisonum ', ' Metacortandracin ', ' Deltadehydrocortisone ', ' Deltacortisone ', ' Delta(1)-Cortisone ', ' Dehydrocortisone ', ' 17,21-dihydroxy-pregna-1,4-diene-3,11,20-trione ', ' 1, 2-Dehydrocortisone ', ' Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1 ', ' PFT/FEV1 ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume 1 Test ', ' FEV1%VC ', ' FEV1 ', ' empowered ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' trial comparing ', ' functional health literacy ', ' standard measure ', ' literacy ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K02,2011,105219,0.21021921912792746
"Vitamin D and Susceptibility to Inhaled Pollutants in Urban Children with Asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project promises to be a rich training experience that will allow me to develop the skills necessary for clinical research. It achieves this through a combination of a rigorous research plan, relevant coursework, and supervised dedicated mentorship. Below is a summary of the research proposal. The urban minority pediatric population in the United States has a disproportionate burden of asthma. Several factors may contribute to this disparity, including high exposure to environmental pollutants and allergens, a poor diet, and other disadvantages of poverty. Recent attention has focused on the antioxidant and immune-modulatory role of vitamin D which may confer a protective effect on disease morbidity, and several clinical observational and cross-sectional studies support that low vitamin D levels may lead to greater allergic and asthma manifestations. Epidemiological studies, including our own preliminary investigations in Baltimore, have discovered that a significant proportion of African-American inner-city children with asthma have well below the recommended levels of serum vitamin D, and that, in these same children, indoor particulate matter (PM) is a significant cause of asthma morbidity. We therefore propose to determine whether lowerlevels of vitamin D, in such a highly-affected and vulnerable population, may increase their susceptibility to inhaled pollutants. To achieve this goal, we will nest this proposed study within an existing grant (The Center for Childhood Asthma in the Urban Environment DISCOVER # 1P50ES015903), which is currently recruiting 130 predominantly-black children with asthma, ages 5-12 years, in urban Baltimore to study the mechanisms by which air pollution induces lung inflammation and oxidative stress. This project proposal has three novel aims. First, to better understand the relationship between vitamin D levels and asthma health, we will be repeatedly measuring each subject' s serum vitamin D levels, daily asthma symptoms and medication use, and twice-daily lung function during 4 one-week periods in each season of the year. Second, to determine if varying levels of vitamin D modify the inflammatory response to air pollution, we will also be monitoring each child' s personal exposure to environmental PM throughout the day and simultaneously be measuring biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation present in blood, urine, and nasal lavage fluid. Finally, we will be collecting information regarding sun exposure, skin type, and dietary intake in order to assess the determinants of vitamin D status in this chronically low population, in preparation for future public health strategies directed towards improving asthma health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma attacks are particularly severe among urban African-American children and account for significant personal, economic, and social costs. Recent studies show that the majority of these children have low blood levels of vitamin D, and that the lower their levels, the worse their asthma symptoms seem to be. We would like to understand if low vitamin D levels put children at increased risk to be affected by common environmental triggers; if true, then improving their vitamin D status may ultimately protect urban minority children from a high burden of disease.          Project Narrative  Asthma attacks are particularly severe among urban African-American children and  account for significant personal, economic, and social costs.

"Caregiver Quality of Life in Pediatric Asthma: Family and Cultural Predictors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities in pediatric asthma continue to be a significant public health concern. Racial and ethnic minority children with asthma, particularly Latino and African American children, are at greater risk for increased morbidity (e.g., emergency department (ED) utilization) and mortality. As pediatric asthma is managed within the family context, mechanisms to explain such differences might include parent quality of life (QOL; parent adaption to the child's illness), family beliefs about asthma, and caregiver asthma status. In particular, caregiver QOL may be a key factor in pathways explaining racial and ethnic differences in ED utilization. Further, it is likely that culturally based beliefs about asthma are important aspects of caregiver QOL that are not captured by current measurements of caregiver QOL. Assessments of caregiver QOL provide critical knowledge to health care providers and clinicians regarding the burden that the child's asthma and treatment regimen can present on the family's daily life and barriers to effective asthma control. This study is an investigation of caregiver QOL in Latino (Dominican and Puerto Rican), African American, and Non-Latino White (NLW) families with a child with asthma. First, data collected from the Rhode Island/Puerto Rico Asthma Center for the NHLBI funded study, ""Pediatric Asthma Disparities: Perceptions and Management"" (U01- HI072438, G. Fritz, G. Canino, PIs), will be analyzed. RIPRAC is one of only four NHLBI funded centers examining asthma health disparities. Through these analyses, the validity of the widely used, Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ; Juniper et al., 1996) will be examined among Latino and NLW caregivers in Rhode Island and Puerto Rico. Second, data on 150 Latino, African American, and NLW families with a child with asthma will be collected. Racial and ethnic differences in associations between asthma beliefs, caregiver asthma, caregiver QOL, and ED use will be assessed. Findings from this study will be used to identify modifiable targets of family-based interventions to improve caregiver QOL and decrease morbidity in African American and Latino children with asthma. !      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities in pediatric asthma are a growing public health concern, especially with respect to increased emergency care utilization in Latino and African American children as compared to Non-Latino Whites. As pediatric asthma is managed within families, pathways related to the utilization of emergency services might include the impact of culturally based asthma beliefs on caregiver quality of life. Ultimately, findings from this study will identify modifiable targets of family-based interventions to improve parent adaption to child asthma and decrease morbidity in Latino and African American children. !          7.

"Development of a Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite higher levels of morbidity and mortality, African American children receive asthma care that is less consistent with national asthma guideline recommendations compared to white children. Access to care, insurance status and socioeconomic status have not fully explained these disparities. Poor assessments of asthma morbidity and suboptimal communication between physicians and parents of inner-city children with asthma may contribute racial disparities in quality of asthma care. We propose to examine the effects of an asthma-focused communication intervention on parent-physician communication and quality of asthma care among inner-city African American children. The objective of this project is to design, validate and implement an effective Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument (P-ACCI) within an innercity- based, university pediatric clinic. We therefore propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To develop and validate a simple, paper-and-pencil pediatric asthma control and communication instrument (P-ACCI) to serve as a both a prompt and a communication aide for the physician and the parent to discuss issues of asthma health; 2) To conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial in a primary care pediatric setting of inner-city African American children with asthma in order to assess the effects of the P-ACCI on the quality of patientphysician communication and quality of asthma care. We hypothesize that: 1) the P-ACCI is a valid measure of asthma morbidity; 2) regular use of the P-ACCI will improve the quality of parent-physician communication and the quality of asthma care for children. Relevance: There is a pressing need for simple, low-cost clinical strategies applicable in diverse settings to improve communication about variables important to asthma management. Such strategies would enhance clinical judgment, decision-making, and quality of asthma care. The current study will evaluate a novel, lowcost tool with the potential to reduce asthma care disparities related to poor parent-physician communication My career goals involve becoming a successful investigator of racial disparities in quality of asthma care, and to become a Professor of Pediatrics who develops remedies to improve asthma care through a multidisciplinary research center, and to reduce racial disparities in asthma care and asthma outcomes.

"Multisystemic therapy to reduce health disparities in adolescents with asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common cause of hospitalization in children other than infections. The Health People 2000 initiative to reduce asthma hospitalizations was NOT met. Minority, inner city children, particularly adolescents, appear to be most at risk for high morbidity and mortality. Poor illness management is thought to be a primary driver of asthma morbidity and mortality. Yet, there are very few randomized controlled trials with inner city adolescents with asthma. Because of the complexity of asthma management and the associated barriers, intensive, multi-component interventions are needed to improve outcomes among those at highest risk. The investigators have adapted Multisystemic Therapy (MST), an innovative home- and community-based psychotherapy, to successfully improve treatment adherence and outcomes in urban pediatric medical populations. The objective of the present study is to utilize MST to improve asthma management and to reduce health care utilization (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) among high risk African American adolescents (ages 12-16) with moderate to severe persistent asthma. High risk is defined as having >=2 emergency department visits or >= 1 hospitalizations in 12 months). Additional aims are to determine the stability of MST's effects over a 12 month interval and to determine cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Families will be recruited from the only university-affiliated medical center in Detroit, Michigan. Detroit has the highest percentage of African Americans of any major city in the United States. The experimental design for the proposed study is a randomized controlled trial with 170 high risk African American adolescents with moderate to severe persistent asthma, 85 of whom will receive standard multidisciplinary specialty care (control condition) and 85 of whom will receive this care plus MST. Families will complete an initial data collection session (baseline), a 7-month post-test designed to coincide with treatment completion, and a subsequent post-test at 12 months after baseline. If successful, this intervention will provide immediate assistance to a vulnerable population disproportionately affected by asthma and may reduce costs of care for this high risk population. While asthma is the second most common cause of hospitalization in children, minority, inner city teens are at increased risk for complications from the disease. We are testing the effectiveness of an intervention for inner city African American teens with asthma using Multisystemic Therapy an intensive, home- and community-based psychotherapy. If successful, this intervention will improve asthma management and overall health, as well as reduce healthcare costs for this vulnerable population disproportionately affected by asthma.          ",Multisystemic therapy to reduce health disparities in adolescents with asthma,8105127,R01HL087272,"['Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Wolves ', ' Inpatients ', ' Community Health ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Censuses ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' treatment effect ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Visit ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' treatment adherence ', ' Secondary to ', ' Provider ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' social ', ' Risk ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Morbidity -

"Coping Peer Intervention for Adherence in Urban African American Adolescents with    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High rates of asthma morbidity and mortality among inner-city African American adolescents demand urgent intervention. Compared to white non-Hispanic and Hispanic children, black non-Hispanic children have the highest rates of hospitalizations and deaths due to asthma. To address this disparity, the investigators have designed a culturally sensitive intervention aimed at improving adherence to daily controller medications for asthma, and ultimately reduce asthma exacerbation risk, that fits easily into adolescents' chaotic lifestyles. The proposed study is a behavioral randomized controlled trial that tests if a coping peer intervention can increase adherence to asthma controller medications among urban African American adolescents 14 to 16 years of age. To ensure the project's success, the principal investigator has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of researchers, including behavioral and social science experts and a community asthma leader. The Specific Aims propose to: (1) evaluate the impact of a 3-month coping peer support intervention on adherence and knowledge, compared to an attention control; (2) evaluate the ability of a 3-month and a 6-month coping peer support intervention to achieve sustained post-treatment improvements in adherence and knowledge, compared to an attention control; and (3) to develop estimates needed for the design of a subsequent R01 behavioral controlled trial testing the efficacy of this intervention to decrease risk of asthma exacerbations. The study's primary outcome is adherence to daily asthma controller medications, measured using an objective electronic monitor. Study participants will be randomized to receive equal medical supervision and music tracks plus either: (1) group support, coping peer group problem solving, and peer delivered asthma messages (experimental group); or (2) physician developed and recorded general health messages (attention control group) on a portable MP3 player. The group support and coping peer group problem solving consists of: putting subjects together in a small group to discuss barriers to adherence and ways to overcome these barriers; then having group members record messages to each other about overcoming barriers that will be played on their MP3 player, between music tracks, during the course of their daily routines. This effectively brings the coping peer support from the group into the course of the adolescents' day-to-day lives. The investigators hypothesize that it is the ability of the MP3 player to facilitate ongoing peer support that will be the basis for improved adherence. The long term goal is to apply the data from this research to submit an R01 grant application to conduct a behavioral randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of this coping peer intervention to improve adherence, and ultimately reduce asthma exacerbations, in urban African American adolescents with asthma.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Inner-city African American adolescents suffer from disproportionately high rates of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for acute exacerbations of asthma. This study proposes the use of a coping peer support intervention, enhanced by a technology-based platform that infuses the peer support throughout adolescents' daily routines, to increase adherence to daily controller medications and ultimately reduce asthma exacerbation risk in this important population subgroup. This research is based on the principle that, to promote sustained adherence to appropriate medications in this target population, interventions must be culturally competent and fit easily into adolescents' lifestyles.            Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Coping Peer Intervention for Adherence Project Narrative Inner-city African American adolescents suffer from disproportionately high rates of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for acute exacerbations of asthma.

"Reducing Asthma Morbidity in High Risk Minority Preschool Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite advances in asthma therapies and the wide-spread dissemination of asthma clinical guidelines, low-income, minority children have disproportionately high morbidity and mortality from asthma. The National Center for Children in Poverty has strongly argued that effective interventions to improve asthma health disparities and reduce harm must begin in early childhood. Previous efficacy studies have suggested that asthma education programs can be effective in improving overall management of asthma for preschool children. However, for these promising asthma intervention strategies to have sustainable public health impact for low-income, minority children they must be integrated within those medical, educational and social structures that serve these young high risk children, such as community clinics, schools and day care programs. Because one of the core missions of federally- funded Head Start programs is to provide preventive health services and screening to their low-income preschool students, Head Start represents an ideal community setting for disseminating early asthma education. We propose to draw on our established health and research partnership with Head Start programs in Baltimore City to test the effectiveness of this home-based asthma education intervention with demonstrated efficacy, when delivered in the context of a Head Start-wide asthma education program. We further propose to partner with Head Start to support and evaluate adoption, maintenance and dissemination of new knowledge gained from this project. Specifically we hypothesize that participants receiving the ABC intervention combined with a HS-level asthma education will have more symptom free days at the 6-, 9-, and 12-month evaluation when compared with participants in the HS- level asthma education alone. We plan to enroll of 406 children age 2-6 years old enrolled in Head Start with symptomatic asthma. Secondary outcome measures include other measures of asthma morbidity (i.e., hospitalizations, ED visits, oral steroid bursts, school absences, and caregiver quality of life). We will also evaluate the mediating effects of outcomes expectancies, self-efficacy, asthma knowledge, motivation, and asthma management practices, as well as moderator effects, such as health literacy, caregiver depression, neighborhood cohesion, family management of asthma, and Head Start adoption and dissemination of an asthma education curriculum.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite advances in asthma therapies and the wide-spread dissemination of asthma clinical guidelines, low-income, minority children have disproportionately high morbidity and mortality from asthma. The current study will test the effectiveness of this home-based asthma education intervention with demonstrated efficacy, when delivered in the context of a Head Start-wide asthma education program in improving asthma morbidity.

"Explaining Racial Disparities in Child Asthma Morbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  Asthma is a leading cause of childhood morbidity, however the burden falls disproportionately on minority children and children of low socioeconomic status. Despite advances in asthma care, disparities in rates of asthma emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, and re-hospitalizations remain persistently high. The NIH seeks personalized approaches based on genes and biomarkers to identify and treat diseases at their earliest stages. Similar tailored approaches must be developed to prevent and ameliorate racial disparities in health at their earliest stages. This applications seeks to characterize remediable social and environmental factors most relevant to excess asthma morbidity in disadvantaged children.  The central objective of this project is to examine children hospitalized with asthma to explore how race shapes social and environmental factors and how these, in turn, may influence the likelihood of re- admission for asthma. Genes are not a focus of the current applications, but DNA will be collected for future gene-environment studies. Fully characterizing the social and environmental components of race differences will help ensure that the search for genetic susceptibilities is a thoughtful and balanced one. We will enroll a population-based prospective cohort of children hospitalized with asthma and examine their risk of re-hospitalization and ER use for asthma over time with a primary focus on disparities in readmission.  The specific aims are to: 1) characterize racial differences in risk of asthma-related re- hospitalization and ER visits after an index hospitalization and to examine in detail the potential contributions of socioeconomic status to that disparity (contrasting individual and area level measures of SES), 2) examine selected environmental exposures (traffic exposure, biomarker of tobacco smoke exposure, allergic sensitization) and psychosocial variables (adherence, caregiver stress) in relation to both asthma morbidity and race, and 3) examine the extent to which these environmental and psychosocial exposures explain disparities in time to asthma re-hospitalization rate and ER visits.  This study offers a careful characterization of disparities in asthma morbidity along with a detailed look at potential mediators of these disparities. The innovation of the grant includes its focus on pathways most relevant to disease disparities, its broad 'geography to genes' framework, its emphasis on children at highest risk, and its population-based sample. This submission by a new investigator brings together stellar investigators with a broad spectrum of expertise. Moreover, the research occurs in an institutional environment with highly developed asthma research programs and one committed to developing effective interventions. We envision moving aggressively toward real-time clinical interventions that tailor effective disease management plans best suited to help children with the fewest resources.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Asthma is a leading cause of childhood morbidity.

"BELT: Blacks & Exacerbations on LABA vs. Tiotropium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Blacks bear a disproportionate burden of asthma morbidity and mortality. In its 2005 report on ethnic disparities in health care, AHRQ identified hospital admissions for asthma as the second largest disparity in quality of health care for Blacks versus Whites. Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), a popular treatment option for asthma, are in a class of drugs acting at ADRB2, which have been associated with rare loss of long-term asthma control and increased serious adverse outcomes including death and respiratory failure, even when used with ICS. The risk appears to be four to five-folds greater in Blacks than non-Black patients with asthma. Comparison of studies with LABA/ICS in Blacks versus studies where Blacks were a small minority suggests that Blacks may have much less benefit than other racial groups. Additionally, recent data (Wechsler 2009) suggest that a polymorphism at the 16th position of the ADRB2 gene identifies a group of Blacks (those homozygous for arginine (Arg16Arg)) in whom the response of adding a LABA to an ICS is further diminished. This polymorphism is present in ~20% of U.S. Blacks. In order to address the resulting knowledge gaps, a study is proposed to determine, in a one year practice-based, real-world, randomized, prospective, parallel group, longitudinal comparative effectiveness trial with the clinically important primary outcome of asthma exacerbations, whether in self-identified Black patients with asthma, treatment with LABA/ICS is superior to use of a non-2-adrenergic bronchodilator (tiotropium) combined with ICS (Tio/ICS). The study will also aim to determine, whether in the 20% of self-identified Black patients with asthma bearing Arg16Arg of ADRB2, treatment with LABA/ICS is superior to use of a non-2-adrenergic bronchodilator combined with ICS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of this study will provide the information necessary to make evidence-based, individualized, recommendations concerning treatment algorithms and potential alternative treatment recommendations for the 3.5 million Blacks with asthma. The performance of this study in real life primary care settings will hasten the translation of these findings into day to day practice for this minority population that experiences a disproportionate burden of asthma and has been underrepresented in previous asthma studies.

"Whole Genome Analyses for Asthma in Latino Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, asthma prevalence is highest in Puerto Ricans (26%) and lowest in Mexicans (10%). This is paradoxical since both groups are considered ""Hispanic"" or ""Latino"". Although there are many potential explanations for this observation, including environmental and socioeconomic factors, one potential explanation is that the genetic predisposition to asthma differs among subgroups within the Latino population. Latinos are admixed and share varying proportions of African, Native American and European ancestry. The mixed ancestry of Latinos provides unique opportunities in epidemiological and genetic studies and may be useful in untangling complex gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in disease susceptibility. This proposal will take advantage of clinical data and genomic DNA on 2,100 Puerto Rican and 1,500 Mexican asthma cases and controls collected as part of two large studies of asthma in Latinos (GALA 1 and GALA 2). The goal of this proposal is to perform genome-wide association analyses to identify genetic factors associated with asthma and related phenotypes in Puerto Ricans and Mexicans. In addition, potential interactions between these genetic factors and other genes and environmental variables will be investigated. Specifically, we will: 1) genotype Puerto Rican and Mexican asthma cases and controls using the Affymetrix state-of-art 500K GeneChip arrays, 2) perform genome-wide association analysis on 500K GeneChip data to identify SNPs associated with asthma, asthma severity and bronchodilator response. The analysis will include clinical and demographic characteristics, environmental factors and individual admixture estimates to correct for potential confounders. In addition, admixture mapping analysis will be performed to complement the genome-wide association analysis. Admixture mapping may identify novel regions that harbor racial/ethnic specific alleles for asthma and related phenotypes; and 3) fine map SNPs significantly associated with asthma and related phenotypes in genome-wide analyses (initial-hit SNPs). To our knowledge this is the first proposal to perform a genome-wide association analysis for asthma and related phenotypes in Latinos. Due to the size and scope of this project, the results of this study should substantially increase our understanding of the etiology of asthma and drug response. By gaining a better understanding of asthma risk factors in diverse populations, this proposal is consistent with the goals established by Healthy People 2010, which are to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population.

"A Pilot Stress Management Intervention for High Risk Children with Asthma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children in the United States, with disproportionately high morbidity and mortality among minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged children living in urban areas. These disparities are not fully accounted for by differences in asthma prevalence, highlighting a need for interventions targeting factors associated with poorer asthma control. Converging evidence suggests that psychosocial factors that accompany socioeconomic disadvantage contribute to the marked disparities in childhood asthma morbidity, with psychological stress predicting future asthma exacerbations in children. Chronic stress and lower socioeconomic status also are associated with the exacerbation of airway inflammatory responses to environmental triggers and the upregulation of inflammatory processes directly implicated in asthma exacerbation. Evidence that stress accentuates airway inflammation and predicts asthma morbidity raises the possibility that psychological interventions aimed at helping children manage stress could improve the physical health of high risk children with asthma. To date, studies of psychosocial interventions for pediatric asthma have been of poor general quality, highlighting a need for further more rigorous research. Accordingly, we have developed a stress management and coping skills training program based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (""I Can Cope""). Preliminary trials provide initia support for the feasibility of offering this supplemental intervention to 8-12 year old asthmatics n urban schools and provide initial evidence for intervention-related decreases in perceived stress and improvements in lung function, as measured by spirometry. The primary objective of the proposed research is to conduct a critical randomized controlled pilot evaluation of the effectiveness of this school-based intervention to obtain data that is necessary to develop a full-scale clinical trial. For this purpose, we propose randomly assigning 108 economically disadvantaged urban 3rd through 6th graders with physician-confirmed asthma to the school-based intervention or an education only control condition. Primary outcomes will include (1) psychological function and (2) asthma health, as assessed at the end of the intervention period. If future work confirms our initial feasibility findings, this will be the first study to demonstrae the health benefit of a school-based asthma stress management intervention for high risk children living in urban settings, providing a novel means of intervening to reduce disparities in asthma morbidity. Furthermore, it will provide a more efficient and cost-effective means of accessing vulnerable children than individual clinic based intervention, which we have not found to be feasible.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:         Minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged children living in urban areas in the US are at disproportionately high risk for asthma morbidity, with disparities in asthma severity being larger than those in asthma prevalence. Growing evidence shows that psychosocial factors that accompany socioeconomic disadvantage may play a role in these disparities, with psychological stress predicting future asthma exacerbations in children. The current application proposes a pilot study examining the first school-based intervention to target this modifiable risk factor. Thus, the public health implications of the project are considerable and include the identification of a method of intervening to reduce disparities in asthma morbidity. In addition, we anticipate that the intervention will be cost effective, reducing medical visits, use of as needed medications, and school absenteeism.        (End of Abstract)                      Minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged children living in urban areas in the US are at disproportionately high risk for asthma morbidity, with disparities in asthma severity being larger than those in asthma prevalence.

Part of this reason is due to the fact that young adulthood represents a dramatic change for an individual, where for the first time they may be responsible for their own health care, finances, education, and employment responsibilities.  An internet-based interactive health communication program offers a unique way to address challenges and improve asthma care for this difficult-to-reach population. It provides a mechanism to deliver asthma education, personalize recommendations, improve communication with health care providers, and be delivered at a time convenient to the participant. Such a program would also be delivered with minimal human support, making it ideal for urban environments which may not have the resources for health educators.  We will develop and pilot test such a program, which will be tailored to the challenges each individual faces. The program will be based on the self-regulation theory of behavior, which will enhance the participants' ability to self-manage this chronic condition. Focus groups will first be utilized to ensure that the participant's perspectiveis fully conveyed. The findings from the focus groups will be incorporated into a multi-session internet based intervention. This intervention will incorporate both standard asthma education delivered by video and personalized messages of how to overcome the specific challenges each individual faces. We will assess the ability of such a program to attract potential participants, retain participants who agree to participate, communicate relevant information back to the participant's health care provider, and operate seamlessly with minimal live support. We will explore any participant preferences, challenges, and obstacles to the use of the program over the entire multi-session intervention. Asthma specific outcomes will also be assessed at 3 and 6 months. These will include quality of life, asthma symptoms, asthma control, self-efficacy, and health care utilization. This exploratory study is critical to develop a consumer health informatics intervention, which we will fully evaluate in a subsequent R01 application.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions in the United States, and also one which displays a tremendous amount of health care disparities.

"Reducing Asthma Disparities Through School-Based Telemedicine for Rural Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma disproportionately burdens minority and low-income pediatric populations, and these disparities have persisted among high-risk children despite the dissemination of NHLBI asthma management guidelines more than a decade ago. Previous investigations suggest that asthma guidelines-based care has not translated to high-risk children living in rural regions. Asthma-related morbidity and non-adherence to asthma guidelines is prevalent among high-risk rural children living in the Mississippi Delta region of Arkansas, an impoverished and medically underserved region of the United States. Large-scale interventions to decrease asthma burden among high-risk rural children have not been designed, and interventions designed for other populations are not feasible due to distance and travel barriers and lack of subspecialty asthma services inherent to rural communities. The overall goal of the proposed project is to decrease asthma health outcomes disparities among high-risk children living in a rural, medically underserved environment. To address this goal, we propose conducting a cluster randomized trial with 540 children, ages 4-17 years, to implement a school-based telemedicine intervention in rural public school districts. The school-based intervention will provide comprehensive asthma education via telemedicine to rural children with asthma, their caregivers and school nurses; prospectively monitor asthma symptoms and lung function via telemedicine; and provide primary care providers with treatment prompts according to nationally published asthma guidelines. We hypothesize that children receiving school-based asthma education and monitoring via telemedicine in conjunction with a provider treatment prompt will have decreased asthma-related morbidity as compared to children receiving usual care. The aims of the project will: 1) examine the efficacy of a school-based asthma telemedicine intervention in improving asthma-related health outcomes in an intervention group compared to a usual care group; 2) examine the effects of a school-based asthma telemedicine intervention on asthma self-management skills; and 3) determine the cost of the intervention. Telemedicine will allow for the utilization of proven technology to deliver a state-of-the-art asthma intervention in a high-risk population and will significantly reduce challenges associated with distance and travel barriers inherent to rural communities. An innovative telemedicine approach to improve asthma health outcomes among high-risk rural children has high impact potential because findings from the proposed intervention will directly inform public health strategies to implement large-scale telemedicine services in a school-based setting. The intervention will have direct applicability to other high-risk asthma populations in rural and medically underserved regions and can be translated to school-based health intervention strategies to target other chronic health conditions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project may have a profound impact on public health because it presents a practical school-based intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines. Should it prove successful in reducing symptoms and improving the health of rural children with asthma, it has the potential to serve as a model for improved asthma care in other medically underserved communities.           NARR ATIVE - RELEVANCE This project may have a profound impact on public health because it presents a practical school-based intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines.

"Mentoring and Patient Oriented Research in Asthma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Dr. Diette is Associate Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he has joint appointments in Epidemiology and Environmental Health Sciences at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Since joining the faculty, Dr. Diette has served as mentor to more than 20 trainees, including 14 postdoctoral fellows.  With rare exception, his mentees have gone on to highly productive academic careers, garnering honors and receiving NIH grant support (NRSA, K23, R21, R01 U01 and Project Leader on program grants). The majority of his professional life has been dedicated to the conduct of research, presentation and dissemination of findings and establishing a steady base of research funding from the NIH and other sources. The focus of Dr. Diette's career has been on patient-oriented research in asthma, especially race-based health care disparities and environmental determinants of the disease. The main purpose of this K24 proposal is to provide relief from clinical and administrative duties in order to expand the POR program and dedicate additional time and energy to current and future trainees. Thus, the overall aims of this proposal are: Aim 1: To enhance the candidate's capacity to mentor clinician scientists in patient-oriented research; and Aim 2: To expand the candidate's clinical research program in directions that create new scientific opportunities for him and his mentees.          Dr. Diette directs the ASTHMA-DIET, a program award examining how diet contributes to asthma susceptibility in children and co-directs the Hopkins DISCOVER program, which investigates mechanisms by which allergens and pollutants provoke inflammation and oxidative stress. These programs are the research homes for his current mentees. These multi-project programs bring together broad scientific expertise from allergists, pulmonologists, adult and pediatric medicine, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, environmental health engineers and others. While substantial evidence now exists for the role of the indoor environment in pediatric asthma, there is insufficient evidence of the biologic mechanisms by which allergens and pollutants may provoke inflammation and oxidative stress in inner city adults.  As adults with asthma endure the majority (90%) of mortality attributed to the disease, treatments are inadequate, especially in the area of environmental control.  A major focus of this proposal will be to expand the present research program from inner city children to also include inner city adults. The proposed cohort of 100 inner city adults with asthma will examine the extent to which indoor particulate matter provokes oxidative stress and inflammation.  With this expansion in the research program, the candidate will provide the foundation for future trials in adults of home-based multi- component environmental interventions, goals which are concordant with the career goals of current mentees and will establish the infrastructure for future mentees with a research interest in adult asthma.        NARRATIVE  This award will have two major impacts on public health. First, it will expand the pool of researchers capable of patient oriented research, which is necessary for translation of research findings into viable asthma treatments. Second, the research program will add to the knowledge of how to reduce the burden of asthma in inner city adults, a group that suffers disproportionate morbidity and mortality from the disease.",Mentoring and Patient Oriented Research in Asthma,8224977,K24ES021098,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Allergens ', ' Appointment ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Award ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' IgE ', ' Inflammation ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Environmental Protection ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' inner city ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' member ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' NRSA ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' Adult asthma ', ' environmental intervention ', ' biomarker ', ' ']",NIEHS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2012,185024,0.3144499978171081
"Comparison of Asthma Programs for Schools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Comparison of Asthma Programs for Schools (CAPS) study is to evaluate efficacy of a new developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling asthma health education program compared to a low-dose control, well-established, non-academic program. The new program for diverse fifth- grade students with asthma and their family caregivers is entitled, ""Staying Healthy Asthma Responsible & Prepared"" (SHARP). SHARP is a comprehensive, theory-driven, evidenced-guided program developed in collaboration with school personnel and members of one community asthma coalition that has two components: (a) a Student Component and (b) Community Component. The low-dose comparison group will receive Open Airways for Schools (OAS) that is widely disseminated through the American Lung Association. Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of SHARP compared to the low-dose OAS control group for fifth-grade students on cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral aspects of asthma management immediately post- and at 12 and 24 months post-intervention. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the long-term effect of SHARP compared to the low-dose OAS control group for fifth-grade students on condition characteristics, use of healthcare services, and quality of life at 12 and 24 months post intervention. A two-group, longitudinal, prospective, cluster- randomized, single-blinded trial will be used. Schools will be matched based on fifth-grade enrollment numbers, standardized reading and math scores, free/reduced lunch eligibility, and racial/ethnic proportions prior to randomization. The unit of analysis will be the student. The sample will consist of 2 cohorts of fifth- grade students, ages 9-12 years, with asthma and their caregivers. Two cohorts of student/caregiver dyads will be recruited over 2 years (N=152 dyads per year for a total of 304 dyads over two years) and analyzed separately. A minimum of 5-6 dyads will be recruited from 30 elementary schools located in three communities with 10 schools selected from each community. Participants will represent varying socioeconomic, cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. Recently retired certified elementary schoolteachers identified by the areas' school districts will be trained to serve as interveners to deliver SHARP or OAS during school hours. Evaluators will collect pre- and post-intervention data from dyads in the home using audio-linked data entry systems loaded on laptop computers at four time points. A bi-monthly automated voice recorded telephone survey will be placed to caregivers to monitor symptom days, medication use, use of healthcare services, and school absenteeism. To adjust for non-independence of observations within schools, hypotheses will be tested using the generalized estimating equations approach for categorical or ordinal variables and linear mixed models for continuous outcomes. After efficacy is demonstrated, this study would advance scientific knowledge through the offering of a comprehensive, developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling education program for older school age students with asthma that is not currently available. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nine million U.S. children under 18 years of age have been diagnosed with asthma at some point in their lives and approximately 4 million children have had an asthma episode in the last 12 months. This project seeks to compare efficacy of two school-based asthma education programs for fifth-grade students with asthma aimed at improving cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes; decreasing severity of illness; and improving quality of life. After efficacy is demonstrated, this study would advance scientific knowledge through the offering of a comprehensive, developmentally-appropriate, school-based academic and counseling education program for older school age students with asthma that is not currently available.

"AsthmaNet:  Phenotypic Influences on Asthma Treatments     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Pittsburgh AsthmaNet proposal includes 3 protocols, with a 4th mechanistic protocol built around unmet asthma needs and phenotyping. These protocols should contribute to understanding asthma phenotypes in relation to mechanisms and specific treatment, particularly in relation to health disparities and contributions from race, socioeconomic status (SES) and asthma severity. These protocols build on our inherent expertise in asthma phenotyping and biology, racial/ethnic/socioeconomic issues, environmental effects, particularly in relation to underserved populations, psychosocial stress, and severe asthma. Our proposal includes participation from the Center for Minority Health with expertise in outreach in minority populations, a partner at Rainbow Babies of Case Western Reserve and a satellite at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. The 1st clinical trial will compare two approved drugs for treatment of the adult onset asthma phenotype, which hypothesizes that a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor will be more effective than a leukotriene receptor antagonist. The 2nd study evaluates the role of race in relation to SES on corticosteroid (CS) responses in children, h3TJ0thesizing that the African-American asthma phenotype, with and without regard to SES, predicts a poor response to inhaled CSs in asthmatic children. Vitamin D supplementation will overcome the poor response and improve outcomes. We will recruit African American and Caucasian children stratified by race and SES. Children who remain symptomatic following initial stabilization will be treated with high dose ICS and response determined. Children of all groups who do not improve will be randomized to treatment with Vitamin D or higher ICS dose to determine whether Vitamin D + lower dose ICS improves exacerbations and CS responsiveness better or to the same degree than the higher dose ICS. The mechanistic ancillary protocol will address whether aspects of CS unresponsiveness can be modeled in vitro, including effects of race/SES factors on cytokine suppression and histones, and the effect of Vitamin D to improve them. Finally, the severe asthma protocol will focus on the mast cell, specifically prostaglandin D2 and its interaction with CRTH2. We believe these studies address unmet needs in asthma and will improve its therapy.

"Asthma Disparities in Latino Children:Acculturation,Illness Representations & CAM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethnic disparities in asthma health outcomes among Latino children are so striking that researchers and public health officials have issued a call for action to understand why this is occurring. Recent descriptive asthma research confirmed that these disparities are not totally explained by genetic, environmental, healthcare system or provider factors. Little research has been conducted integrating, in one explanatory model, the multitude of factors that lead to disparities. Perhaps of importance, but not well examined, is the role that illness representations (the way one interprets health and illness that influences management of health problems) may play in parents' decisions to use CAM and controller medications to manage their children's asthma. Parents are the gatekeepers for their children's healthcare and ultimately make the final treatment decisions. Before developing interventions targeting asthma health disparities, a more thorough understanding of the interaction of individual, cultural, experiential, and healthcare system factors and the social-environmental context is needed. The proposed study moves the research from descriptive studies to a multi-level examination of the interaction of social, cultural, experiential, environmental, and healthcare system factors on disparities in asthma control among Mexican and Puerto Rican children. The aims of this study are 1) to explore differences in illness representations between these Latino subgroups due to social and contextual factors, and 2) to test a growth model examining disparities in asthma control as a function of differences in parents' treatment decisions (CAM and controller medication use) and changes in illness representations over one year. This will be a one-year longitudinal, multi-site study of parental illness representations and CAM and controller medication use among a sample of 300 Latino (primarily Mexican and Puerto Rican) parents and children aged 5-12 who have asthma. Interviews and child assessments will be conducted with parents and children at enrollment, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment. This assessment schedule allows us to capture seasonal variations in the children's asthma symptoms as well as conform to the recommendation that children on daily controller medications have follow-up visits every 3 months. We will obtain spirometry measures from the children, and review children's medical records. To ensure diverse representation of Latino families and healthcare settings, the sample will be recruited from two community school-based health clinics and one clinical practice site in Phoenix, AZ, and two inner-city hospital asthma clinics in Bronx, NY. A multisite study is warranted because neither site alone has sufficient numbers of both Mexican and Puerto Rican families to conduct this research independently. It is preferable that interviews and assessments be conducted simultaneously among these two populations to minimize seasonal variations in asthma symptom control and to maximize standardization of administration of the surveys across time and samples. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ethnic disparities in childhood asthma outcomes between Mexican and Puerto Rican children asthma outcomes are so striking that researchers and public health officials have issued a call for action to understand why this is occurring. The factors leading to asthma health disparities between Mexican and Puerto Rican children are complex, yet little research has been conducted integrating, in one explanatory model, the multitude of factors that can lead to these disparities. The proposed study moves the research from descriptive studies of individual constructs and contexts to testing an integrated, multi-factorial model. The innovation of this project lies in the multi-level examination of co-varying influences (socio-demographic, cultural, experiential, environmental, and healthcare system) on disparities in asthma control among a sample of 300 Mexican and Puerto Rican children and their parents over a one year period.

The innovation of this project lies in the multi-level examination of covarying influences (sociodemographic, cultural, experiential, environmental, and healthcare system) on disparities in asthma control among a sample of 300 Mexican and Puerto Rican children and their parents over a one year period.","Asthma Disparities in Latino Children:Acculturation,Illness Representations & CAM",8325454,R01AT005216,"['Accounting ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Belief ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Cultural Characteristics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medical Records ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Parental Ages ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Seasonal Cycle ', ' Seasonal Variations ', ' Illness Behavior ', ' Sick Role ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Spirometry ', ' Standardization ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' wheeze ', ' Wheezing ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Genetic ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists ', ' Leukotriene Antagonists ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' member ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' parent influence ', ' parental influence ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Complementary and alternative medicine ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Belief System ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' evidence base ', ' child poverty ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NCCIH,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,467195,0.3263472216846927
"Explaining Racial Disparities in Child Asthma Morbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  Asthma is a leading cause of childhood morbidity, however the burden falls disproportionately on minority children and children of low socioeconomic status. Despite advances in asthma care, disparities in rates of asthma emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, and re-hospitalizations remain persistently high. The NIH seeks personalized approaches based on genes and biomarkers to identify and treat diseases at their earliest stages. Similar tailored approaches must be developed to prevent and ameliorate racial disparities in health at their earliest stages. This applications seeks to characterize remediable social and environmental factors most relevant to excess asthma morbidity in disadvantaged children.  The central objective of this project is to examine children hospitalized with asthma to explore how race shapes social and environmental factors and how these, in turn, may influence the likelihood of re- admission for asthma. Genes are not a focus of the current applications, but DNA will be collected for future gene-environment studies. Fully characterizing the social and environmental components of race differences will help ensure that the search for genetic susceptibilities is a thoughtful and balanced one. We will enroll a population-based prospective cohort of children hospitalized with asthma and examine their risk of re-hospitalization and ER use for asthma over time with a primary focus on disparities in readmission.  The specific aims are to: 1) characterize racial differences in risk of asthma-related re- hospitalization and ER visits after an index hospitalization and to examine in detail the potential contributions of socioeconomic status to that disparity (contrasting individual and area level measures of SES), 2) examine selected environmental exposures (traffic exposure, biomarker of tobacco smoke exposure, allergic sensitization) and psychosocial variables (adherence, caregiver stress) in relation to both asthma morbidity and race, and 3) examine the extent to which these environmental and psychosocial exposures explain disparities in time to asthma re-hospitalization rate and ER visits.  This study offers a careful characterization of disparities in asthma morbidity along with a detailed look at potential mediators of these disparities. The innovation of the grant includes its focus on pathways most relevant to disease disparities, its broad 'geography to genes' framework, its emphasis on children at highest risk, and its population-based sample. This submission by a new investigator brings together stellar investigators with a broad spectrum of expertise. Moreover, the research occurs in an institutional environment with highly developed asthma research programs and one committed to developing effective interventions. We envision moving aggressively toward real-time clinical interventions that tailor effective disease management plans best suited to help children with the fewest resources.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Asthma is a leading cause of childhood morbidity. The burden of asthma morbidity, however, falls disproportionately on minority children and children of low socioeconomic status.

"Development of a Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Despite higher levels of morbidity and mortality, African American children receive asthma care that is less consistent with national asthma guideline recommendations compared to white children. Access to care, insurance status and socioeconomic status have not fully explained these disparities. Poor assessments of asthma morbidity and suboptimal communication between physicians and parents of inner-city children with asthma may contribute racial disparities in quality of asthma care. We propose to examine the effects of an asthma-focused communication intervention on parent-physician communication and quality of asthma care among inner-city African American children. The objective of this project is to design, validate and implement an effective Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument (P-ACCI) within an innercity- based, university pediatric clinic. We therefore propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To develop and validate a simple, paper-and-pencil pediatric asthma control and communication instrument (P-ACCI) to serve as a both a prompt and a communication aide for the physician and the parent to discuss issues of asthma health; 2) To conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial in a primary care pediatric setting of inner-city African American children with asthma in order to assess the effects of the P-ACCI on the quality of patientphysician communication and quality of asthma care. We hypothesize that: 1) the P-ACCI is a valid measure of asthma morbidity; 2) regular use of the P-ACCI will improve the quality of parent-physician communication and the quality of asthma care for children. Relevance: There is a pressing need for simple, low-cost clinical strategies applicable in diverse settings to improve communication about variables important to asthma management. Such strategies would enhance clinical judgment, decision-making, and quality of asthma care. The current study will evaluate a novel, lowcost tool with the potential to reduce asthma care disparities related to poor parent-physician communication My career goals involve becoming a successful investigator of racial disparities in quality of asthma care, and to become a Professor of Pediatrics who develops remedies to improve asthma care through a multidisciplinary research center, and to reduce racial disparities in asthma care and asthma outcomes.

"Multi-Level Understanding of Social Contributors to SES Disparities in Asthma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in health outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES) are one of the most pressing public health problems our society faces today. In line with PAR-10-136's interest in multi-level approaches to understanding health disparities, we focus on childhood asthma and investigate factors simultaneously across neighborhood, family, and individual levels; we consider both physical environment and social environment exposures together; and we examine various levels of biological processes (organ systems, cellular, genomic) that drive asthma pathophysiology, all within a single project that seeks to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the causes of asthma disparities. The first aim is to understand how neighborhood, family, and individual-level social factors both shape and are shaped by one another, and how they collectively affect asthma disparities. The second aim is to measure social and physical exposures concurrently in order to explain how they interact to affect asthma disparities. The third aim is to create biologically plausible models for how social contexts contribute to health disparities by characterizing pathways at multiple levels biologicall (organ systems, cellular, genomic) that can explain how social contexts come to affect asthma disparities. This study will recruit a sample of 300 families from varying SES backgrounds who have a child ages 10-18 with persistent asthma. Families will participate in laboratory assessments of individual- and family-level social processes as well as child biological measures. Information on neighborhood characteristics will be linked from geographic information system maps of pollution exposures and maps of the social characteristics of communities created by a research consortium locally. In order to establish the temporal precedence of each of the 'levels' of factors, clinical outcomes will be tracked across a 1 year follow up period via monthly monitoring of symptoms as well as from hospitalization data obtained from provincial health records. Creating models that explain how neighborhood, family, and individual factors simultaneously contribute to asthma disparities is critical for developing a more holistic picture of how social contexts affect disease progression. These models will in turn shape our approaches to interventions. For example, interventions to improve medication adherence may not be effective if they do not acknowledge the broader social factors (e.g., neighborhood and family stress) that affect families' abilities to keep up with medication regimens. Assessing interactive effects between factors will also allow us to identify specific conditions under which potential targets of intervention would make the biggest differences in mitigating the pathophysiological processes underlying asthma. The overall goal of this project is to develop a more sophisticated understanding of why asthma disparities by SES exist and to identify the constellation of factors that would need to be targeted simultaneously in order to effectively alleviate these disparities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive, multi-level models that convincingly explain the multitude of ways in which low socioeconomic status (SES) is able to have pervasive effects on health are important for developing interventions that can maximally reduce health disparities. The proposed project will investigate social and physical environment factors across neighborhood, family, and individual levels in an effort to understand disparities by SES in childhood asthma. The overarching goal is to develop more sophisticated models of how social and physical environments affect and interact with one another to contribute to disease progression differentially in low SES children.              Comprehensive, multi-level models that convincingly explain the multitude of ways in which low socioeconomic status (SES) is able to have pervasive effects on health are important for developing interventions that can maximally reduce health disparities.

"Genetic Susceptibility to Asthma and IndoorAir Pollution in Peru    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is an epidemic that disproportionately affects children, the poor and certain racial/ethnic groups. Latinos/Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the US and are disproportionately affected by asthma morbidity. From 1990 to 2000 there was an 81 percent increase in number of people that mark their ethnic origin as Peruvian on the US Census survey and the prevalence of asthma in Peru is among one of the highest in the world. Asthma is a complex disease and genetic risk for asthma and asthma morbidity may be modified by environmental exposures. The indoor environment is of particular concern as most people spend the majority of their time indoors. Investigators in this application have shown that high levels of indoor exposures, including particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), are independently associated with greater asthma morbidity, and are particularly high in Peruvian homes. The burden of asthma attributable to differences in domestic PM and NO2 concentrations is substantial; however, not all children are susceptible to effects of pollutant exposure and a large variation in response exists between individuals. These findings suggest a strong possibility of an interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental exposure in the development of asthma. To address the critical questions of the role of genetic susceptibility to the adverse effects of indoor air pollution on asthma, we will build upon the infrastructure and ongoing data collection efforts in Peru. We propose a candidate gene study to identify genetic variants associated with asthma and its associated traits (i.e., asthma severity, pulmonary function, airway inflammation) in relation to indoor air pollutant exposure in two Peruvian cities, Lima and Tumbes. We will prioritize candidate genes identified by published genome-wide association studies for asthma as well as those in the oxidative stress pathway thought to be relevant to pollutant exposure and asthma. We will cross-validate associations identified in well characterized asthma cases and controls from Lima, Peru (n=1,400), in a second independent population of asthmatic cases and controls recruited from Tumbes, Peru (n=400). Specific Aim #1: To identify genes associated with asthma in children in Peru. Specific Aim #2: To determine if genetic risk for asthma is modified by indoor air pollutant (PM, NO2) concentrations. We anticipate identifying candidate genes for asthma and associated traits relevant to both the general population as well as those contributing to disparities in asthma morbidity among individuals in Peru. Identifying subgroups of the population who are particularly vulnerable to air pollution is an important objective, as the results can be used to identify people most likely to benefit from exposure avoidance.

"Green Housing Study: Boston Followup     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma currently affects nearly 22 million adults and children in the U.S., and results in direct and indirect costs exceeding $18 billion/year (CDC, 2012, AAFA, 2012). Disparities in asthma prevalence and morbidity across economic and racial lines are striking, with prevalence rates exceeding 25% in some low-income urban areas (Nicholas et al., 2005). The need for improvements in healthcare and for interventions which mitigate environmental exposures within these communities are significant.  In order to examine the potential for ""green"" improvements to the home environment to reduce exposures to chemicals and other asthma triggers within the home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiated the Green Housing Study (GHS). As stated in the RFP, the specific aims of the GHS are as follows: Specific Aim 1 To conduct an exposure assessment of chemical and biological contaminants, pesticides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), fungi, indoor allergens (in terms of variety and concentration) in green vs. comparison housing.  a. Measure interior levels of pesticides in surface wipe samples; fungi and indoor allergens in dust samples; and VOCs in air samples.  b. Compare levels of biomarkers of VOCs and pesticides (in terms of variety and concentration) from the participating residents of green and comparison housing. Specific Aim 2 To examine the relationship between living in green vs. comparison housing and asthma morbidity (e.g., symptoms, emergency department visits, use of medications, lost school/work days) of children with doctor-diagnosed asthma (ages 7-12 years). Adjustments for allergic sensitization and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) will be made.  In 2011, two study sites were established: Boston and Cincinnati. Fieldwork began in the summer of 2011 and baseline assessments are being conduction currently. The requested funding will provide support for follow-up measurements of exposures and respiratory health outcomes of children who are enrolled in GHS. Our project team is a collaboration that builds upon the significant expertise and resources of colleagues from the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH), Tufts School of Medicine, the Boston Medical Center and the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. To date, our team has developed significant expertise in all field procedures and has successfully implemented all categories of principal study activities. We propose to complete all 6- and 12-month follow-up fieldwork by June 2013.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Residential exposures to allergens and pollutants contribute to asthma morbidity.

"Vitamin D, Steroids, and Asthma in African American Youth     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Further studies are urgently needed in order to identify effective and sustainable strategies for reducing the dramatic health disparities experienced by disadvantaged, urban, and minority youth with asthma. Vitamin D deficiency is more common among African American (AA) individuals, especially those from urban environments or with obesity. We and others have contributed to increasing evidence that vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to more severe asthma through increased risk of respiratory infection and decreased glucocorticoid sensitivity. Indeed, low vitamin D levels were recently linked with the need for exogenous glucocorticoids and increased asthma severity. Particularly relevant to health disparities, we showed a strong association between vitamin D insufficiency and asthma in urban African American (AA) youth. Because AA youth residing in urban Washington, DC have markedly worse asthma than other racial/ethnic groups (e.g. prevalence rate 20% higher than the national rate 15 and emergency department utilization rates up to 5 times the national rates and nearly 10 times the Healthy People 2010 target rate), we will utilize our access to this population at the extreme of asthma disparities to examine the contribution of vitamin D to disparities in the chronic control and acute severity of asthma. The overall goal of this application is to provide critical epidemiological/molecular information that ill inform the interpretation of ongoing and impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma. The knowledge generated by the experiments in this application will be crucial to translation of this inexpensive, easily-accessible potential therapy for asthma. We hypothesize that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels are associated with poor chronic asthma control, worse acute asthma severity, and glucocorticoid insensitivity. AIM 1. Define asthma phenotypic clusters and determine cross- sectional inter- and intra-cluster associations with serum 25(OH)D levels within and between AA and non-AA youth. AIM 2. Determine prospective associations among serum 25(OH)D levels and: (a) chronic asthma control and (b) acute asthma severity within and between AA and non-AA youth. AIM 3. Show the effect of vitamin D on glucorticoid regulation of inflammatory mediators in asthmatic airway epithelial cells.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to provide critical epidemiological/molecular information that will inform the interpretation of ongoing and impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma.

"Multisystemic therapy to reduce health disparities in adolescents with asthma Asthma is the most common cause of hospitalization in children other than infections. The Health People 2000 initiative to reduce asthma hospitalizations was NOT met. Minority, inner city children, particularly adolescents, appear to be most at risk for high morbidity and mortality. Poor illness management is thought to be a primary driver of asthma morbidity and mortality. Yet, there are very few randomized controlled trials with inner city adolescents with asthma. Because of the complexity of asthma management and the associated barriers, intensive, multi-component interventions are needed to improve outcomes among those at highest risk. The investigators have adapted Multisystemic Therapy (MST), an innovative home- and community-based psychotherapy, to successfully improve treatment adherence and outcomes in urban pediatric medical populations. The objective of the present study is to utilize MST to improve asthma management and to reduce health care utilization (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) among high risk African American adolescents (ages 12-16) with moderate to severe persistent asthma. High risk is defined as having >=2 emergency department visits or >= 1 hospitalizations in 12 months). Additional aims are to determine the stability of MST's effects over a 12 month interval and to determine cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Families will be recruited from the only university-affiliated medical center in Detroit, Michigan. Detroit has the highest percentage of African Americans of any major city in the United States. The experimental design for the proposed study is a randomized controlled trial with 170 high risk African American adolescents with moderate to severe persistent asthma, 85 of whom will receive standard multidisciplinary specialty care (control condition) and 85 of whom will receive this care plus MST. Families will complete an initial data collection session (baseline), a 7-month post-test designed to coincide with treatment completion, and a subsequent post-test at 12 months after baseline. If successful, this intervention will provide immediate assistance to a vulnerable population disproportionately affected by asthma and may reduce costs of care for this high risk population. While asthma is the second most common cause of hospitalization in children, minority, inner city teens are at increased risk for complications from the disease. We are testing the effectiveness of an intervention for inner city African American teens with asthma using Multisystemic Therapy¿an intensive, home- and community-based psychotherapy. If successful, this intervention will improve asthma management and overall health, as well as reduce healthcare costs for this vulnerable population disproportionately affected by asthma.

"Asthma Management and Ethnic Disparities at the Adolescent Transition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised K24 application proposes a mentorship program in patient-oriented research in pediatric asthma, with a specific focus on health care disparities and disease management behaviors. The K24 Candidate is an Associate Professor (Research) in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior of the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, with a history of funding in behavioral interventions to improve disease management and address health disparities in pediatric asthma. Training Plan: The candidate will obtain additional training in longitudinal data analysis, behavioral genetics, evaluation and assessment in health education, and health care access for Latino immigrants to enrich her skills and mentoring capacity in future health care disparities research. Research Plan: A longitudinal study of medication adherence for Latinos and non-Latino white (NLW) youth with asthma is proposed to assess the differential course of medication adherence by culture across the transition to adolescence. Three waves of 50 youth with persistent asthma (150 total, 25 Latino, 25 NLW in each wave) will complete a multimethod assessment of asthma status, family factors, medication beliefs, and controller medication use. Assessments will occur in eighth grade, then again in tenth grade, with continuous monitoring of medication adherence throughout. Analyses will evaluate the role of medication beliefs and family connectedness in supporting asthma management in Latino and NLW youth with persistent asthma, and assess differential trajectories of medication use by ethnic group over time. Mentoring Plan: The proposed mentoring plan offers participation in an RCT to address asthma disparities in medication use, access to an ongoing educational program for asthma that serves over 700 families a year, and an archival dataset that includes a wealth of data on disease management behavior in over 800 Latino and NLW children in Rl and Puerto Rico. An additional ongoing seminar is planned for junior faculty on topics such as recruiting and retaining culturally diverse samples, and preparing research grant applications. This overall plan capitalizes on the rich resources and training opportunities available to postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty at Brown, including seven T32 fellowship programs, numerous junior faculty with K awards and small grants, seminars in research design, ethics, and statistics, and established infrastructure for evaluation.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public Health Significance: Asthma is a common chronic illness in which minority children are disproportionately affected. Facilitating mentorship and execution of high quality patient-oriented research in this area is critical to address health care disparities.

"Reducing Asthma Morbidity in High Risk Minority Preschool Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite advances in asthma therapies and the wide-spread dissemination of asthma clinical guidelines, low-income, minority children have disproportionately high morbidity and mortality from asthma. The National Center for Children in Poverty has strongly argued that effective interventions to improve asthma health disparities and reduce harm must begin in early childhood. Previous efficacy studies have suggested that asthma education programs can be effective in improving overall management of asthma for preschool children. However, for these promising asthma intervention strategies to have sustainable public health impact for low-income, minority children they must be integrated within those medical, educational and social structures that serve these young high risk children, such as community clinics, schools and day care programs. Because one of the core missions of federally- funded Head Start programs is to provide preventive health services and screening to their low-income preschool students, Head Start represents an ideal community setting for disseminating early asthma education. We propose to draw on our established health and research partnership with Head Start programs in Baltimore City to test the effectiveness of this home-based asthma education intervention with demonstrated efficacy, when delivered in the context of a Head Start-wide asthma education program. We further propose to partner with Head Start to support and evaluate adoption, maintenance and dissemination of new knowledge gained from this project. Specifically we hypothesize that participants receiving the ABC intervention combined with a HS-level asthma education will have more symptom free days at the 6-, 9-, and 12-month evaluation when compared with participants in the HS- level asthma education alone. We plan to enroll of 406 children age 2-6 years old enrolled in Head Start with symptomatic asthma. Secondary outcome measures include other measures of asthma morbidity (i.e., hospitalizations, ED visits, oral steroid bursts, school absences, and caregiver quality of life). We will also evaluate the mediating effects of outcomes expectancies, self-efficacy, asthma knowledge, motivation, and asthma management practices, as well as moderator effects, such as health literacy, caregiver depression, neighborhood cohesion, family management of asthma, and Head Start adoption and dissemination of an asthma education curriculum.         Despite advances in asthma therapies and the wide-spread dissemination of asthma clinical guidelines, low-income, minority children have disproportionately high morbidity and mortality from asthma. The current study will test the effectiveness of this home-based asthma education intervention with demonstrated efficacy, when delivered in the context of a Head Start-wide asthma education program in improving asthma morbidity. If successful, this project could have significant public health implications for reducing health disparities for minority children with asthma.

"Admixture mapping in African American Asthmatic Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: The candidate is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics in the Divisions of Asthma Research at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati. Upon completion of his quantitative genetics training, the candidate pursed statistical and human genetics fellowship programs at the University of Alabama Section on Statistical Genetics and the Human Genetics Center of Medical College of Wisconsin. These projects have been published in peer-review journals. Dr. Baye's overall research interest includes the use of quantitative and statistical genetics methods to dissect complex diseases particularly asthma and asthma-related allergy disorders. The long-term goals are to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality associated with asthma. Environment: At the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical center, the applicant will work with a highly collaborative multidisciplinary research team and will be fostered in an excellent academic environment offering outstanding educational programs for junior faculty members. The institution, through the Divisions of Asthma Research, Asthma Center, Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Biomedical Informatics and the Genetic Variation and Gene Discovery Core, provides all resources and facilities that are needed for the applicant's proposed research and is providing full access to all necessary resources to the applicant. The applicant will be provided 90% protected time to conduct the research proposed in this application. Research: This project aims to develop a program of study that would lead to an in depth understanding of the genome of African American (AA) admixed populations and develop procedures and methods for utilizing this information and SNP markers for linkage disequilibrium admixture mapping to localize asthma liability genes. The burden of asthma is disproportionately high among individuals of African descent. Due to recent admixture, AAs have a mixed parental genome contribution, with an average ratio of 80:20 for the proportion from African descent and European descent. This generates linkage disequilibrium (LD) among alleles on all chromosomes, which is detectable even at substantial distances (20-30 cM) using Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs). We plan to develop methods to exploit this LD that span along the genomes of AAs with asthma, in search for specific regions of unusually high African or European ancestry, thereby identifying the chromosomal segments that are likely to contain genes that are related to the disease liability. To achieve these goals, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) Investigate the genome of African American admixed population using our recently developed ancestry informative markers (Baye et al., 2009); 2) Estimate admixture proportions and evaluate differences between asthma cases and controls; 3) Apply these procedures to investigate whether genetic ancestral background at the 5q31 region is associated with asthma outcome measures. Hence, genotypic data from HapMap, Perlegen datasets and Greater Cincinnati Pediatric Clinic Cohort will be used to test the approach and enhance our ability to map asthma liability genes. Implications: This career development plan will foster Dr. Baye's development into an established independent expertise in complex disease and asthma genetics. The research will improve mapping of loci affecting complex traits in admixed populations, ultimately improving elucidation of the genetic architecture of complex human diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of asthma is disproportionately high among individuals of ethnic minorities. This project aims to develop procedures and methods for utilize the genome of admixed African American populations to localize asthma liability genes by modeling individual estimates of genetic admixture and socioeconomic status on measures of asthma. By gaining a better understanding of asthma risk factors in admixed minority populations, this proposal is consistent with the goals established by Healthy People 2010, which are to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population.

"School-Based Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management (SB-TEAM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a first competing renewal of a school-based program designed to reduce morbidity for poor children with asthma by facilitating delivery of guideline-based care and improving adherence to effective preventive asthma medications. In 2006, we implemented the School Based Asthma Therapy (SBAT) trial (R01HL079954) with 530 children from more than 50 urban schools. The primary intervention for the SBAT trial consisted of directly observed administration of preventive asthma medications in school (with dose adjustments according to NHLBI guidelines). Results from this study demonstrate reduced morbidity, decreased absenteeism, and fewer exacerbations for these very high-risk children. This program has the potential to serve as a model for improved asthma care in urban communities, however several factors limit dissemination of the program in its current form. For example, extensive resources were required for screening and implementation of the program, and communications with providers for ongoing monitoring of symptoms were inefficient, often delaying recommended medication adjustments. In order for this program to have sustainable public health impact, we must now test a system that allows for full integration within the school and community systems that serve these children. In this new application we propose the next phase in our research, which represents a critical step in our expanding partnership with the city school district. We propose testing a novel school-based program (SB-TEAM - School-Based Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management), which directly builds on our prior work, for children with persistent asthma in Rochester City Elementary Schools.  We recently developed and pilot-tested the technology for web-based screening and communication for this intervention (RC1HL099432), and now propose a full-scale trial across an entire school district using this technology with the addition of telemedicin asthma assessments to assure appropriate follow-up care and optimal treatment. We hypothesize that children receiving care through SB-TEAM will experience less asthma- related morbidity compared to children in an enhanced usual care (eUC) comparison group. Further, we anticipate that the benefits will be even greater than those seen in the original SBAT trial, due t the ability to more optimally tailor each child's medication regimen. The SB-TEAM program includes systematic web-based asthma screening, directly observed administration of preventive asthma medications in school, and ongoing monitoring and tailoring of the care regimen using school-based telemedicine. Children in the eUC group will receive asthma screening with notification of their PCP, as well as systematic feedback to the parent and provider to promote appropriate guideline based follow-up care. This application represents a logical extension of our work to improve adherence to effective asthma medications that can reduce health disparities and could ultimately be sustained in communities nationwide.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urban children with asthma suffer from substantial morbidity and suboptimal preventive care. This project may have a profound impact on public health because it proposes an expansion of an innovative school- based intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines that is specifically designed to promote optimal care within an existing infrastructure. Should it prove successful in reducing symptoms and improving the health of urban children with asthma, it has the potential to serve as a sustainable model for improved asthma care for this population.              Urban children with asthma suffer from substantial morbidity and suboptimal preventive care.

"Psychosocial Factors and the Risk of Incident Asthma in African American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and African-Americans fare worse than whites on all measures of asthma morbidity. Reasons for the disparity have not been satisfactorily explained. Psychosocial factors like experiences of violence and living in disadvantaged and/or inner city neighborhoods have been found to play a role in childhood asthma prevalence and severity. While the role of psychosocial factors in asthma expression has been studied in children there is little research on such factors in adults. Stress is the putative mechanism and there are plausible biological mechanisms by which it may contribute to the incidence of adult-onset asthma. Psychosocial factors may be of particular importance in asthma incidence in black women because the prevalence of experiences of violence, racism, depression, and living in disadvantaged neighborhoods are higher than in white women. If such experiences increase the risk of adult onset asthma, they may contribute to the racial disparity in asthma morbidity. The objective of this application is to fill this gap in knowledge about the role of psychosocial factors in incident adult-onset asthma in African American women. Our central hypothesis is that individual- and neighborhood-level psychosocial factors that may lead to stress increase the risk of adult-onset asthma in African-American women. The rationale for the proposed research is that the identification of factors that increase the risk of adult-onset asthma is a necessary step in the development of preventive policies and interventions to reduce both levels of adult-onset asthma and the gap in black/white asthma morbidity. The specific aims of this application are to 1) estimate the influence of experiences of racism, experiences of violence during childhood and adolescence, and depressive symptoms to asthma incidence and 2) to estimate the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), racial segregation, and urbanicity to asthma incidence. We will conduct prospective analyses using data from the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS). The BWHS cohort, assembled in 1995, includes approximately 59,000 African-American women from across the U.S. Detailed information on demographics, medical and reproductive history, and disease endpoints including asthma, was collected at baseline and in biennial follow- up questionnaires. On selected follow-up questionnaires, information was obtained on the psychosocial factors of interest. Participant addresses have been geocoded and linked with census data. Over 16 years of follow-up through 2011, approximately 1800 incident cases of asthma will have been reported. The study is innovative because it will be the first prospective study to consider the effects of the psychosocial exposures of interest on incident adult asthma in African American women. The proposed research is significant because positive results may direct intervention efforts to address stressors like racism and violence and may motivate further mechanistic studies of how chronic stress leads to asthma, which might inform the development of new therapeutic interventions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will identify psychosocial factors that contribute to asthma incidence in African American women and thus will fill gaps in knowledge about risk factors for adult-onset asthma and about reasons for the racial disparity in asthma morbidity in the US. Results from the proposed study have the potential to inform preventive strategies at the individual and societal level. Thus the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that seeks to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.           The proposed research will identify psychosocial factors that contribute to asthma incidence in African American women and thus will fill gaps in knowledge about risk factors for adult-onset asthma and about reasons for the racial disparity in asthma morbidity in the US.

"Immune regulatory mechanisms and fungus-specific memory T cell responses DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is the causative agent of more than 90% of all Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) infections diagnosed in immunosuppressed patients. Exposure to A. fumigatus can also lead to the development of allergic asthma and Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with atopic asthma or Cystic Fibrosis. Fungus-specific CD4 T cell responses are important in defense against invasive disease and mediate the development of allergic responses. Thus, understanding the factors that control the expansion and formation of fungus-specific memory CD4 T cells will lay the foundation for the future development of novel immune-based therapeutic strategies to enhance or inhibit fungus-specific immunity. In this proposal, the applicant will examine the contributions of regulatory T cells (Tregs), T cell- intrinsic inhibitor receptors (PD-1 and CTLA-4) and CCR2+ dendritic cells (CCR2+DCs) to the formation of memory CD4 T cells in the context of a pulmonary infection with A. fumigatus and in the development of fungal allergic asthma. The applicant will be supported by a comprehensive training plan to promote her career development as an independent scientist and to help her attain a PhD degree. The long-term goal of the applicant is to become a successful, well-funded, independent researcher. As a woman of Hispanic descent the applicant is committed to contributing to the future development of research programs to address health disparities and diversity in biomedical science's workforce. The opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common causative agent of invasive aspergillosis and can also trigger the development of allergic asthma responses. Immune responses to this fungus are central in the pathogenesis of fungal allergic asthma and in the prevention of invasive fungal disease. The studies proposed in this application will elucidate the specific contributions of immune regulatory  mechanisms that promote the proper eradication of A. fumigatus while preventing excessive tissue damage to the host.

"Green Housing Study: Boston Followup  Project Summary/Abstract  Asthma currently affects nearly 22 million adults and children in the U.S., and results in direct and indirect costs exceeding $18 billion/year. (CDC, 2012, AAFA, 2012) Disparities in asthma prevalence and morbidity across economic and racial lines are striking, with prevalence rates exceeding 25% in some low-income urban areas. (Nicholas et al., 2005) The need for improvements in healthcare and for interventions which mitigate environmental exposures within these communities are significant.  In order to examine the potential for ""green"" improvements to the home environment to reduce exposures to chemicals and other asthma triggers within the home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiated the Green Housing Study (GHS). As stated in the RFP, the specific aims of the GHS are as follows: Specific Aim 1 To conduct an exposure assessment of chemical and biological contaminants, pesticides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), fungi, indoor allergens (in terms of variety and concentration) in green vs. comparison housing.  a. Measure interior levels of pesticides in surface wipe samples; fungi and indoor allergens in dust samples; and VOCs in air samples.  b. Compare levels of biomarkers of VOCs and pesticides (in terms of variety and concentration) from the participating residents of green and comparison housing. Specific Aim 2 To examine the relationship between living in green vs. comparison housing and asthma morbidity (e.g., symptoms, emergency department visits, use of medications, lost school/work days) of children with doctor-diagnosed asthma (ages 7-12 years). Adjustments for allergic sensitization and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) will be made.  In 2011, two study sites were established: Boston and Cincinnati. Fieldwork began in the summer of 2011 and baseline assessments are being conduction currently. The requested funding will provide support for follow-up measurements of exposures and respiratory health outcomes of children who are enrolled in GHS. Our project team is a collaboration that builds upon the significant expertise and resources of colleagues from the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH), Tufts School of Medicine, the Boston Medical Center and the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. To date, our team has developed significant expertise in all field procedures and has successfully implemented all categories of principal study activities. We propose to complete all 6- and 12-month follow-up fieldwork by June 2013.  Project Narrative  Residential exposures to allergens and pollutants contribute to asthma morbidity. Green building and renovation methods provide opportunities to reduce these exposures and thus, improve health. This project provides follow-up measurements for a CDC-led study of the effects of green renovations on environmental exposures and health for children diagnosed with asthma living in low-income communities.",Green Housing Study: Boston Followup,8503423,U01EH000991,[''],NCEH,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,U01,2013,199601,0.28266621927348684
"Reducing Asthma Morbidity in High Risk Minority Preschool Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite advances in asthma therapies and the wide-spread dissemination of asthma clinical guidelines, low-income, minority children have disproportionately high morbidity and mortality from asthma. The National Center for Children in Poverty has strongly argued that effective interventions to improve asthma health disparities and reduce harm must begin in early childhood. Previous efficacy studies have suggested that asthma education programs can be effective in improving overall management of asthma for preschool children. However, for these promising asthma intervention strategies to have sustainable public health impact for low-income, minority children they must be integrated within those medical, educational and social structures that serve these young high risk children, such as community clinics, schools and day care programs. Because one of the core missions of federally- funded Head Start programs is to provide preventive health services and screening to their low-income preschool students, Head Start represents an ideal community setting for disseminating early asthma education. We propose to draw on our established health and research partnership with Head Start programs in Baltimore City to test the effectiveness of this home-based asthma education intervention with demonstrated efficacy, when delivered in the context of a Head Start-wide asthma education program. We further propose to partner with Head Start to support and evaluate adoption, maintenance and dissemination of new knowledge gained from this project. Specifically we hypothesize that participants receiving the ABC intervention combined with a HS-level asthma education will have more symptom free days at the 6-, 9-, and 12-month evaluation when compared with participants in the HS- level asthma education alone. We plan to enroll of 406 children age 2-6 years old enrolled in Head Start with symptomatic asthma. Secondary outcome measures include other measures of asthma morbidity (i.e., hospitalizations, ED visits, oral steroid bursts, school absences, and caregiver quality of life). We will also evaluate the mediating effects of outcomes expectancies, self-efficacy, asthma knowledge, motivation, and asthma management practices, as well as moderator effects, such as health literacy, caregiver depression, neighborhood cohesion, family management of asthma, and Head Start adoption and dissemination of an asthma education curriculum.         Despite advances in asthma therapies and the wide-spread dissemination of asthma clinical guidelines, low-income, minority children have disproportionately high morbidity and mortality from asthma. The current study will test the effectiveness of this home-based asthma education intervention with demonstrated efficacy, when delivered in the context of a Head Start-wide asthma education program in improving asthma morbidity. If successful, this project could have significant public health implications for reducing health disparities for minority children with asthma.

"Vitamin D, Steroids, and Asthma in African American Youth  Abstract  Further studies are urgently needed in order to identify effective and sustainable strategies for reducing the dramatic health disparities experienced by disadvantaged, urban, and minority youth with asthma. Vitamin D deficiency is more common among African American (AA) individuals, especially those from urban environments or with obesity. We and others have contributed to increasing evidence that vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to more severe asthma through increased risk of respiratory infection and decreased glucocorticoid sensitivity. Indeed, low vitamin D levels were recently linked with the need for exogenous glucocorticoids and increased asthma severity. Particularly relevant to health disparities, we showed a strong association between vitamin D insufficiency and asthma in urban African American (AA) youth. Because AA youth residing in urban Washington, DC have markedly worse asthma than other racial/ethnic groups (e.g. prevalence rate 20% higher than the national rate 15 and emergency department utilization rates up to 5 times the national rates and nearly 10 times the Healthy People 2010 target rate), we will utilize our access to this population at the extreme of asthma disparities to examine the contribution of vitamin D to disparities in the chronic control and acute severity of asthma. The overall goal of this application is to provide critical epidemiological/molecular information that will inform the interpretation of ongoing and impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma. The knowledge generated by the experiments in this application will be crucial to translation of this inexpensive, easily-accessible potential therapy for asthma. We hypothesize that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels are associated with poor chronic asthma control, worse acute asthma severity, and glucocorticoid insensitivity. AIM 1. Define asthma phenotypic clusters and determine cross- sectional inter- and intra-cluster associations with serum 25(OH)D levels within and between AA and non-AA youth. AIM 2. Determine prospective associations among serum 25(OH)D levels and: (a) chronic asthma control and (b) acute asthma severity within and between AA and non-AA youth. AIM 3. Show the effect of vitamin D on glucorticoid regulation of inflammatory mediators in asthmatic airway epithelial cells.  Narrative  The overall goal of this application is to provide critical epidemiological/molecular information that will inform the interpretation of ongoing and impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma.

"A Self-Regulation Intervention for Older Adults with Asthma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma in older adults has been overlooked, understudied, and inadequately treated. While asthma programs targeting the unique needs of children, teenagers, women, minorities, and other populations have been successfully developed, there are currently none for older adults. This is particularly distressing as the asthma hospitalization rates, mortality rates, quality of life, and control are significantly worsein the elderly as compared to other age groups. It is clear that novel approaches are needed to improve the care in this population.  Our group has been active in the research of asthma in the elderly. We have analyzed national asthma data sets to look for disparities in older adults, have conducted qualitative research to determine factors associated with poor control in the elderly, and have performed a pilot study of a self- regulation intervention which was able to improve outcomes. We also have over 20 years of experience in asthma self-regulation interventions and physician communication enhancement for multiple populations of asthma patients. We will combine these strengths into our current protocol.  The intervention program will be based on the self-regulation theory of behavior, which will enhance the participants' ability to self-manage this chronic condition, actively involve the participant in their own health care management, and produce sustained results. In this application, we will evaluate a self-regulation asthma intervention in a diverse population of older adults. The intervention will be personalized to the challenges and goals each individual faces, which will enhance its applicability in different populations. This intervention will incorporate standard asthma education, complementary techniques for which older adults have expressed a strong interest, and enhanced communication with each participant's physician. Asthma specific outcomes will be assessed at one, six, and 12 months. The primary goal of this intervention is to decrease health care utilization (emergency department, urgent care, hospital, and unscheduled visits) for older adults with asthma. We will also assess the ability to improve quality of life, asthma symptoms, asthma control, lung function parameters, self-efficacy, and cost effectiveness.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because adverse asthma outcomes disproportionally affect older adults, yet very little research has been directed towards this population. The proposed intervention directly addresses the National Institute on Aging's mission of extending and improving the healthy, active years of life.            ",A Self-Regulation Intervention for Older Adults with Asthma,8527997,R01AG043401,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Locales ', ' Respiratory Function Tests ', ' Lung Function Tests ', ' Pulmonary function tests ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Motivation ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Spirometry ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Sample Size ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Exhalation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' respiratory ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' urgent care ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2013,361657,0.2839664889054269
"Healthy Learning, Healthy Living Healthy Lives     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to white Americans, African Americans live sicker and die younger. Although the magnitudes of racial socioeconomic status (SES) disparities in morbidity and mortality are often largest among adults, they often begin in childhood. In fact, past research reveals that, ""[racial disparities in U.S. child disease prevalene rates have been observed for obesity, asthma, diabetes, preterm birth, infant death, mental health, birth defects, physical abuse, injury, low birth weight, all-cause mortality, and disabilit."" Accordingly, efforts to eliminate race and SES disparities in health among adults should begin with efforts to prevent and intervene in health disparities among children. America's most prevalent chronic pediatric health condition is asthma. Asthma is also a significant source of race and SES disparities in health, and a correlate, cause and/or consequence of disparities in children's psychosocial stress exposures, academic outcomes, physical living conditions, and other structural, environmental and social factors. The proposed Healthy Living, Healthy Learning, Healthy Lives (HL3) Project equitably engages community and academic partners in an effort to investigate, ameliorate and ultimately eliminate, disparities in children's health, wih a particular focus on asthma, its correlates, consequences and co-morbidities. The Specific Aims of the project are as follows: 1) to strengthen and expand the health focus of an existing community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership. 2) To use the HL3 CBPR partnership to plan and implement a multi-level (individual, family, school, neighborhood, policy) community assessment. 3) To use the results of the community assessment (Aim 2) to plan a multi-level pilot CBPR intervention. 4) To use the intervention plan (Aim 3) to implement a multi-level pilot CBPR intervention study. 5) To evaluate the process and outcomes of the HL3 Project's three-year intervention planning process.         RELEVANCE: To strengthen and expand an existing community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership, and to use this partnership to refine the social determinants of health conceptual framework and design, implement and evaluate a multi-level (individual, family, school, neighborhood, policy) community assessment and intervention plan with an initial focus on asthma, its correlates, consequences and co-morbidities.              ","Healthy Learning, Healthy Living Healthy Lives",8500641,R24MD008046,"['obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Phenotype ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rose ', ' Rosa ', ' Schools ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Genetic ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' infantile death ', ' infant demise ', ' death in first year of life ', ' infant death ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' physical abuse ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' community based participatory research ', ' effective intervention ', ' social health determinants ', ' Molecular Genetic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Africa ', ' Americas ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R24,2013,343769,0.155052672002586
"A Pilot Stress Management Intervention for High Risk Children with Asthma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children in the United States, with disproportionately high morbidity and mortality among minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged children living in urban areas. These disparities are not fully accounted for by differences in asthma prevalence, highlighting a need for interventions targeting factors associated with poorer asthma control. Converging evidence suggests that psychosocial factors that accompany socioeconomic disadvantage contribute to the marked disparities in childhood asthma morbidity, with psychological stress predicting future asthma exacerbations in children. Chronic stress and lower socioeconomic status also are associated with the exacerbation of airway inflammatory responses to environmental triggers and the upregulation of inflammatory processes directly implicated in asthma exacerbation. Evidence that stress accentuates airway inflammation and predicts asthma morbidity raises the possibility that psychological interventions aimed at helping children manage stress could improve the physical health of high risk children with asthma. To date, studies of psychosocial interventions for pediatric asthma have been of poor general quality, highlighting a need for further more rigorous research. Accordingly, we have developed a stress management and coping skills training program based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (""I Can Cope""). Preliminary trials provide initia support for the feasibility of offering this supplemental intervention to 8-12 year old asthmatics n urban schools and provide initial evidence for intervention-related decreases in perceived stress and improvements in lung function, as measured by spirometry. The primary objective of the proposed research is to conduct a critical randomized controlled pilot evaluation of the effectiveness of this school-based intervention to obtain data that is necessary to develop a full-scale clinical trial. For this purpose, we propose randomly assigning 108 economically disadvantaged urban 3rd through 6th graders with physician-confirmed asthma to the school-based intervention or an education only control condition. Primary outcomes will include (1) psychological function and (2) asthma health, as assessed at the end of the intervention period. If future work confirms our initial feasibility findings, this will be the first study to demonstrae the health benefit of a school-based asthma stress management intervention for high risk children living in urban settings, providing a novel means of intervening to reduce disparities in asthma morbidity. Furthermore, it will provide a more efficient and cost-effective means of accessing vulnerable children than individual clinic based intervention, which we have not found to be feasible.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:         Minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged children living in urban areas in the US are at disproportionately high risk for asthma morbidity, with disparities in asthma severity being larger than those in asthma prevalence. Growing evidence shows that psychosocial factors that accompany socioeconomic disadvantage may play a role in these disparities, with psychological stress predicting future asthma exacerbations in children. The current application proposes a pilot study examining the first school-based intervention to target this modifiable risk factor. Thus, the public health implications of the project are considerable and include the identification of a method of intervening to reduce disparities in asthma morbidity. In addition, we anticipate that the intervention will be cost effective, reducing medical visits, use of as needed medications, and school absenteeism.        (End of Abstract)            ",A Pilot Stress Management Intervention for High Risk Children with Asthma,8435350,R34HL107613,"['Absenteeism ', ' abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Spirometry ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Up-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' pulmonary function ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Exhalation ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' skills training ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' post intervention ', ' pilot trial ', ' Minority ', ' airway epithelium infalmmation ', ' airway inflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' Lung Inflammation ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' 12 year old ', ' modifiable risk ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' control trial ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R34,2013,202283,0.36932900441806354
"AsthmaNet:  Phenotypic Influences on Asthma Treatments     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Pittsburgh AsthmaNet proposal includes 3 protocols, with a 4th mechanistic protocol built around unmet asthma needs and phenotyping. These protocols should contribute to understanding asthma phenotypes in relation to mechanisms and specific treatment, particularly in relation to health disparities and contributions from race, socioeconomic status (SES) and asthma severity. These protocols build on our inherent expertise in asthma phenotyping and biology, racial/ethnic/socioeconomic issues, environmental effects, particularly in relation to underserved populations, psychosocial stress, and severe asthma. Our proposal includes participation from the Center for Minority Health with expertise in outreach in minority populations, a partner at Rainbow Babies of Case Western Reserve and a satellite at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. The 1st clinical trial will compare two approved drugs for treatment of the adult onset asthma phenotype, which hypothesizes that a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor will be more effective than a leukotriene receptor antagonist. The 2nd study evaluates the role of race in relation to SES on corticosteroid (CS) responses in children, h3TJ0thesizing that the African-American asthma phenotype, with and without regard to SES, predicts a poor response to inhaled CSs in asthmatic children. Vitamin D supplementation will overcome the poor response and improve outcomes. We will recruit African American and Caucasian children stratified by race and SES. Children who remain symptomatic following initial stabilization will be treated with high dose ICS and response determined. Children of all groups who do not improve will be randomized to treatment with Vitamin D or higher ICS dose to determine whether Vitamin D + lower dose ICS improves exacerbations and CS responsiveness better or to the same degree than the higher dose ICS. The mechanistic ancillary protocol will address whether aspects of CS unresponsiveness can be modeled in vitro, including effects of race/SES factors on cytokine suppression and histones, and the effect of Vitamin D to improve them.

"Multi-Level Understanding of Social Contributors to SES Disparities in Asthma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in health outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES) are one of the most pressing public health problems our society faces today. In line with PAR-10-136's interest in multi-level approaches to understanding health disparities, we focus on childhood asthma and investigate factors simultaneously across neighborhood, family, and individual levels; we consider both physical environment and social environment exposures together; and we examine various levels of biological processes (organ systems, cellular, genomic) that drive asthma pathophysiology, all within a single project that seeks to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the causes of asthma disparities. The first aim is to understand how neighborhood, family, and individual-level social factors both shape and are shaped by one another, and how they collectively affect asthma disparities. The second aim is to measure social and physical exposures concurrently in order to explain how they interact to affect asthma disparities. The third aim is to create biologically plausible models for how social contexts contribute to health disparities by characterizing pathways at multiple levels biologicall (organ systems, cellular, genomic) that can explain how social contexts come to affect asthma disparities. This study will recruit a sample of 300 families from varying SES backgrounds who have a child ages 10-18 with persistent asthma. Families will participate in laboratory assessments of individual- and family-level social processes as well as child biological measures. Information on neighborhood characteristics will be linked from geographic information system maps of pollution exposures and maps of the social characteristics of communities created by a research consortium locally. In order to establish the temporal precedence of each of the 'levels' of factors, clinical outcomes will be tracked across a 1 year follow up period via monthly monitoring of symptoms as well as from hospitalization data obtained from provincial health records. Creating models that explain how neighborhood, family, and individual factors simultaneously contribute to asthma disparities is critical for developing a more holistic picture of how social contexts affect disease progression. These models will in turn shape our approaches to interventions. For example, interventions to improve medication adherence may not be effective if they do not acknowledge the broader social factors (e.g., neighborhood and family stress) that affect families' abilities to keep up with medication regimens. Assessing interactive effects between factors will also allow us to identify specific conditions under which potential targets of intervention would make the biggest differences in mitigating the pathophysiological processes underlying asthma. The overall goal of this project is to develop a more sophisticated understanding of why asthma disparities by SES exist and to identify the constellation of factors that would need to be targeted simultaneously in order to effectively alleviate these disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive, multi-level models that convincingly explain the multitude of ways in which low socioeconomic status (SES) is able to have pervasive effects on health are important for developing interventions that can maximally reduce health disparities. The proposed project will investigate social and physical environment factors across neighborhood, family, and individual levels in an effort to understand disparities by SES in childhood asthma. The overarching goal is to develop more sophisticated models of how social and physical environments affect and interact with one another to contribute to disease progression differentially in low SES children.            ",Multi-Level Understanding of Social Contributors to SES Disparities in Asthma,8542889,R01HL108723,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Allergens ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Shapes ', ' Pollution ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Exhalation ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' health record ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' airway epithelium infalmmation ', ' airway inflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' public health relevance ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,411171,0.30235554550389326
"Reducing Asthma Disparities Through School-Based Telemedicine for Rural Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma disproportionately burdens minority and low-income pediatric populations, and these disparities have persisted among high-risk children despite the dissemination of NHLBI asthma management guidelines more than a decade ago. Previous investigations suggest that asthma guidelines-based care has not translated to high-risk children living in rural regions. Asthma-related morbidity and non-adherence to asthma guidelines is prevalent among high-risk rural children living in the Mississippi Delta region of Arkansas, an impoverished and medically underserved region of the United States. Large-scale interventions to decrease asthma burden among high-risk rural children have not been designed, and interventions designed for other populations are not feasible due to distance and travel barriers and lack of subspecialty asthma services inherent to rural communities. The overall goal of the proposed project is to decrease asthma health outcomes disparities among high-risk children living in a rural, medically underserved environment. To address this goal, we propose conducting a cluster randomized trial with 540 children, ages 4-17 years, to implement a school-based telemedicine intervention in rural public school districts. The school-based intervention will provide comprehensive asthma education via telemedicine to rural children with asthma, their caregivers and school nurses; prospectively monitor asthma symptoms and lung function via telemedicine; and provide primary care providers with treatment prompts according to nationally published asthma guidelines. We hypothesize that children receiving school-based asthma education and monitoring via telemedicine in conjunction with a provider treatment prompt will have decreased asthma-related morbidity as compared to children receiving usual care. The aims of the project will: 1) examine the efficacy of a school-based asthma telemedicine intervention in improving asthma-related health outcomes in an intervention group compared to a usual care group; 2) examine the effects of a school-based asthma telemedicine intervention on asthma self-management skills; and 3) determine the cost of the intervention. Telemedicine will allow for the utilization of proven technology to deliver a state-of-the-art asthma intervention in a high-risk population and will significantly reduce challenges associated with distance and travel barriers inherent to rural communities. An innovative telemedicine approach to improve asthma health outcomes among high-risk rural children has high impact potential because findings from the proposed intervention will directly inform public health strategies to implement large-scale telemedicine services in a school-based setting. The intervention will have direct applicability to other high-risk asthma populations in rural and medically underserved regions and can be translated to school-based health intervention strategies to target other chronic health conditions.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project may have a profound impact on public health because it presents a practical school-based intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines. Should it prove successful in reducing symptoms and improving the health of rural children with asthma, it has the potential to serve as a model for improved asthma care in other medically underserved communities.

"Asthma Disparities in Latino Children:Acculturation,Illness Representations & CAM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethnic disparities in asthma health outcomes among Latino children are so striking that researchers and public health officials have issued a call for action to understand why this is occurring. Recent descriptive asthma research confirmed that these disparities are not totally explained by genetic, environmental, healthcare system or provider factors. Little research has been conducted integrating, in one explanatory model, the multitude of factors that lead to disparities. Perhaps of importance, but not well examined, is the role that illness representations (the way one interprets health and illness that influences management of health problems) may play in parents' decisions to use CAM and controller medications to manage their children's asthma. Parents are the gatekeepers for their children's healthcare and ultimately make the final treatment decisions. Before developing interventions targeting asthma health disparities, a more thorough understanding of the interaction of individual, cultural, experiential, and healthcare system factors and the social-environmental context is needed. The proposed study moves the research from descriptive studies to a multi-level examination of the interaction of social, cultural, experiential, environmental, and healthcare system factors on disparities in asthma control among Mexican and Puerto Rican children. The aims of this study are 1) to explore differences in illness representations between these Latino subgroups due to social and contextual factors, and 2) to test a growth model examining disparities in asthma control as a function of differences in parents' treatment decisions (CAM and controller medication use) and changes in illness representations over one year. This will be a one-year longitudinal, multi-site study of parental illness representations and CAM and controller medication use among a sample of 300 Latino (primarily Mexican and Puerto Rican) parents and children aged 5-12 who have asthma. Interviews and child assessments will be conducted with parents and children at enrollment, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment. This assessment schedule allows us to capture seasonal variations in the children's asthma symptoms as well as conform to the recommendation that children on daily controller medications have follow-up visits every 3 months. We will obtain spirometry measures from the children, and review children's medical records. To ensure diverse representation of Latino families and healthcare settings, the sample will be recruited from two community school-based health clinics and one clinical practice site in Phoenix, AZ, and two inner-city hospital asthma clinics in Bronx, NY. A multisite study is warranted because neither site alone has sufficient numbers of both Mexican and Puerto Rican families to conduct this research independently. It is preferable that interviews and assessments be conducted simultaneously among these two populations to minimize seasonal variations in asthma symptom control and to maximize standardization of administration of the surveys across time and samples. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ethnic disparities in childhood asthma outcomes between Mexican and Puerto Rican children asthma outcomes are so striking that researchers and public health officials have issued a call for action to understand why this is occurring. The factors leading to asthma health disparities between Mexican and Puerto Rican children are complex, yet little research has been conducted integrating, in one explanatory model, the multitude of factors that can lead to these disparities. The proposed study moves the research from descriptive studies of individual constructs and contexts to testing an integrated, multi-factorial model. The innovation of this project lies in the multi-level examination of co-varying influences (socio-demographic, cultural, experiential, environmental, and healthcare system) on disparities in asthma control among a sample of 300 Mexican and Puerto Rican children and their parents over a one year period.

"Asthma and Physical Activity in Urban Children: Cultural and Contextual Factors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric health disparities in the area of asthma, obesity and cardiovascular fitness continue to exist. Specifically, asthma and obesity are highly prevalent co-morbid conditions that disproportionately affect ethnic minority and urban children. These conditions share pathophysiological (e.g., inflammatory mediators) and contextual (living in an urban neighborhood) correlates, which may increase the risk for both conditions. A key lifestyle behavior implicated in both asthma morbidity and obesity risk is physical activity. Some children with asthma tend to restrict overall activities, including physical activity, when symptoms are in poor control. Although stressors related to urban living may also serve as barriers to physical activity among this group, we know little about the potential cultural and contextual mechanisms that help explain the association between asthma and physical activity in ethnic minority children. This ancillary study offers a unique opportunity to examine the association between asthma, physical activity and cultural and contextual factors in a group of urban children who are followed as part of their participation in Project NAPS (Nocturnal Asthma and Performance in School (R01 HD057220; Koinis Mitchell, PI).  Project NAPS includes three, 4-week assessment periods (Session 1, S2, & S3) over the course of one academic year. In this ancillary study, we will incorporate objectively measured physical activity, and perceptions of asthma, physical activity and context to the third assessment period (S3), and add a fourth assessment period (S4) to occur at the start of the following academic year. This additional time point will provide: 1) an opportunity to examine the co-occurrence of asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms, physical activity, and sedentary behavior, and 2) an in depth examination (at S3 and S4) of potential cultural and contextual influences on physical activity in a sample of 150 children with persistent asthma who are overweight/obese or healthy weight.  We hypothesize that children with more asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms will participate in less moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and more sedentary activities. These associations will be more pronounced in children from Latino and AA backgrounds than in Non-Latino White children. We further hypothesize that fear related to asthma and perceptions of neighborhood safety will each be independent predictors of MVPA, and will predict activity levels beyond actual asthma symptom level and measured neighborhood characteristics. We also expect these associations will be more pronounced in caregivers from Latino and AA backgrounds. Finally, we hypothesize that caregivers' perception of exercise as a trigger for asthma will be related to less MVPA and more sedentary behavior. This association will be apparent even when accounting for children's actual exercise-induced brochospasm status (EIB). A similar pattern will be found for children's perceptions. This association will be more pronounced in caregivers and children of Latino and AA backgrounds.  This line of research has significant implications for the development of cultural tailored interventions to: increase physical activity n urban children with persistent asthma; and improve caregiver understanding of asthma symptoms and exercise induced-bronchospasm. Ultimately, study findings could have implications for improving the standard of care for urban and ethnic minority children with persistent asthma.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pediatric health disparities in the area of asthma, obesity and cardiovascular fitness continue to exist.

Further, little is known about the potential cultural and contextual factors that help explain the association between asthma and physical activity in urban and ethnic minority children. Focusing on modifiable factors is a critical step in understanding and ultimately decreasing the health burden related to asthma, obesity and poor cardiovascular health. Results from this study will inform the development of a culturally tailored intervention that targets strategies for increasing physical activity, decreasing sedentary behavior, controlling asthma symptoms, and addressing potential caregiver misperceptions in a sample that is disproportionately burdened by the health risks of obesity and asthma.            ",Asthma and Physical Activity in Urban Children: Cultural and Contextual Factors,8548055,R01HL116254,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Rhinitis allergic atopic ', ' Atopic rhinitis ', ' Allergic rhinosinusitis ', ' Allergic rhinitis due to allergen ', ' Allergic rhinitis ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Rhinitis ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Time ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' inflammatory mediator ', ' Inflammation Mediators ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' instrument ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' elementary school ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Nocturnal Asthma ', ' conditioning ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' obesity risk ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' ']",NHLBI,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2013,404120,0.36474379883898245
"Genetic Susceptibility to Asthma and IndoorAir Pollution in Peru    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is an epidemic that disproportionately affects children, the poor and certain racial/ethnic groups. Latinos/Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the US and are disproportionately affected by asthma morbidity. From 1990 to 2000 there was an 81 percent increase in number of people that mark their ethnic origin as Peruvian on the US Census survey and the prevalence of asthma in Peru is among one of the highest in the world. Asthma is a complex disease and genetic risk for asthma and asthma morbidity may be modified by environmental exposures. The indoor environment is of particular concern as most people spend the majority of their time indoors. Investigators in this application have shown that high levels of indoor exposures, including particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), are independently associated with greater asthma morbidity, and are particularly high in Peruvian homes. The burden of asthma attributable to differences in domestic PM and NO2 concentrations is substantial; however, not all children are susceptible to effects of pollutant exposure and a large variation in response exists between individuals. These findings suggest a strong possibility of an interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental exposure in the development of asthma. To address the critical questions of the role of genetic susceptibility to the adverse effects of indoor air pollution on asthma, we will build upon the infrastructure and ongoing data collection efforts in Peru. We propose a candidate gene study to identify genetic variants associated with asthma and its associated traits (i.e., asthma severity, pulmonary function, airway inflammation) in relation to indoor air pollutant exposure in two Peruvian cities, Lima and Tumbes. We will prioritize candidate genes identified by published genome-wide association studies for asthma as well as those in the oxidative stress pathway thought to be relevant to pollutant exposure and asthma. We will cross-validate associations identified in well characterized asthma cases and controls from Lima, Peru (n=1,400), in a second independent population of asthmatic cases and controls recruited from Tumbes, Peru (n=400). Specific Aim #1: To identify genes associated with asthma in children in Peru. Specific Aim #2: To determine if genetic risk for asthma is modified by indoor air pollutant (PM, NO2) concentrations. We anticipate identifying candidate genes for asthma and associated traits relevant to both the general population as well as those contributing to disparities in asthma morbidity among individuals in Peru. Identifying subgroups of the population who are particularly vulnerable to air pollution is an important objective, as the results can be used to identify people most likely to benefit from exposure avoidance.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and over 300 million people suffer from asthma worldwide, suggesting a large public health burden. We anticipate identifying candidate genes for asthma and associated traits relevant to both the general population as well as those contributing to disparities in asthma morbidity among individuals in Peru. Identifying subgroups of the population who are particularly vulnerable to air pollution is an important objective, as the results can be used to identify people most likely to benefit from exposure avoidance.

"Explaining Racial Disparities in Child Asthma Morbidity    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  Asthma is a leading cause of childhood morbidity, however the burden falls disproportionately on minority children and children of low socioeconomic status. Despite advances in asthma care, disparities in rates of asthma emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, and re-hospitalizations remain persistently high. The NIH seeks personalized approaches based on genes and biomarkers to identify and treat diseases at their earliest stages. Similar tailored approaches must be developed to prevent and ameliorate racial disparities in health at their earliest stages. This applications seeks to characterize remediable social and environmental factors most relevant to excess asthma morbidity in disadvantaged children.  The central objective of this project is to examine children hospitalized with asthma to explore how race shapes social and environmental factors and how these, in turn, may influence the likelihood of re- admission for asthma. Genes are not a focus of the current applications, but DNA will be collected for future gene-environment studies. Fully characterizing the social and environmental components of race differences will help ensure that the search for genetic susceptibilities is a thoughtful and balanced one. We will enroll a population-based prospective cohort of children hospitalized with asthma and examine their risk of re-hospitalization and ER use for asthma over time with a primary focus on disparities in readmission.  The specific aims are to: 1) characterize racial differences in risk of asthma-related re- hospitalization and ER visits after an index hospitalization and to examine in detail the potential contributions of socioeconomic status to that disparity (contrasting individual and area level measures of SES), 2) examine selected environmental exposures (traffic exposure, biomarker of tobacco smoke exposure, allergic sensitization) and psychosocial variables (adherence, caregiver stress) in relation to both asthma morbidity and race, and 3) examine the extent to which these environmental and psychosocial exposures explain disparities in time to asthma re-hospitalization rate and ER visits.  This study offers a careful characterization of disparities in asthma morbidity along with a detailed look at potential mediators of these disparities. The innovation of the grant includes its focus on pathways most relevant to disease disparities, its broad 'geography to genes' framework, its emphasis on children at highest risk, and its population-based sample. This submission by a new investigator brings together stellar investigators with a broad spectrum of expertise. Moreover, the research occurs in an institutional environment with highly developed asthma research programs and one committed to developing effective interventions. We envision moving aggressively toward real-time clinical interventions that tailor effective disease management plans best suited to help children with the fewest resources.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Asthma is a leading cause of childhood morbidity. The burden of asthma morbidity, however, falls disproportionately on minority children and children of low socioeconomic status. This project will examine the extent to which specific environmental and psychosocial factors explain racial disparities in asthma morbidity, specifically related to higher rates of readmission. The public health significance lies in its focus on excess asthma in disadvantaged children and its emphasis on the potentially remediable factors that drive that excess morbidity.

"Mentoring and Patient Oriented Research in Asthma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Dr. Diette is Associate Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he has joint appointments in Epidemiology and Environmental Health Sciences at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Since joining the faculty, Dr. Diette has served as mentor to more than 20 trainees, including 14 postdoctoral fellows.  With rare exception, his mentees have gone on to highly productive academic careers, garnering honors and receiving NIH grant support (NRSA, K23, R21, R01 U01 and Project Leader on program grants). The majority of his professional life has been dedicated to the conduct of research, presentation and dissemination of findings and establishing a steady base of research funding from the NIH and other sources. The focus of Dr. Diette's career has been on patient-oriented research in asthma, especially race-based health care disparities and environmental determinants of the disease. The main purpose of this K24 proposal is to provide relief from clinical and administrative duties in order to expand the POR program and dedicate additional time and energy to current and future trainees. Thus, the overall aims of this proposal are: Aim 1: To enhance the candidate's capacity to mentor clinician scientists in patient-oriented research; and Aim 2: To expand the candidate's clinical research program in directions that create new scientific opportunities for him and his mentees.          Dr. Diette directs the ASTHMA-DIET, a program award examining how diet contributes to asthma susceptibility in children and co-directs the Hopkins DISCOVER program, which investigates mechanisms by which allergens and pollutants provoke inflammation and oxidative stress. These programs are the research homes for his current mentees. These multi-project programs bring together broad scientific expertise from allergists, pulmonologists, adult and pediatric medicine, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, environmental health engineers and others. While substantial evidence now exists for the role of the indoor environment in pediatric asthma, there is insufficient evidence of the biologic mechanisms by which allergens and pollutants may provoke inflammation and oxidative stress in inner city adults.  As adults with asthma endure the majority (90%) of mortality attributed to the disease, treatments are inadequate, especially in the area of environmental control.  A major focus of this proposal will be to expand the present research program from inner city children to also include inner city adults. The proposed cohort of 100 inner city adults with asthma will examine the extent to which indoor particulate matter provokes oxidative stress and inflammation.  With this expansion in the research program, the candidate will provide the foundation for future trials in adults of home-based multi- component environmental interventions, goals which are concordant with the career goals of current mentees and will establish the infrastructure for future mentees with a research interest in adult asthma.        NARRATIVE  This award will have two major impacts on public health. First, it will expand the pool of researchers capable of patient oriented research, which is necessary for translation of research findings into viable asthma treatments. Second, the research program will add to the knowledge of how to reduce the burden of asthma in inner city adults, a group that suffers disproportionate morbidity and mortality from the disease.",Mentoring and Patient Oriented Research in Asthma,8539618,K24ES021098,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Allergens ', ' Appointment ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Award ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' IgE ', ' Inflammation ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Environmental Protection ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' inner city ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' member ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' NRSA ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' Adult asthma ', ' environmental intervention ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIEHS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2013,185487,0.3144499978171081
"Psychosocial Factors and the Risk of Incident Asthma in African American Women  ABSTRACT Asthma has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and African-Americans fare worse than whites on all measures of asthma morbidity. Reasons for the disparity have not been satisfactorily explained. Psychosocial factors like experiences of violence and living in disadvantaged and/or inner city neighborhoods have been found to play a role in childhood asthma prevalence and severity. While the role of psychosocial factors in asthma expression has been studied in children there is little research on such factors in adults. Stress is the putative mechanism and there are plausible biological mechanisms by which it may contribute to the incidence of adult-onset asthma. Psychosocial factors may be of particular importance in asthma incidence in black women because the prevalence of experiences of violence, racism, depression, and living in disadvantaged neighborhoods are higher than in white women. If such experiences increase the risk of adult onset asthma, they may contribute to the racial disparity in asthma morbidity. The objective of this application is to fill this gap in knowledge about the role of psychosocial factors in incident adult-onset asthma in African American women. Our central hypothesis is that individual- and neighborhood-level psychosocial factors that may lead to stress increase the risk of adult-onset asthma in African-American women. The rationale for the proposed research is that the identification of factors that increase the risk of adult-onset asthma is a necessary step in the development of preventive policies and interventions to reduce both levels of adult-onset asthma and the gap in black/white asthma morbidity. The specific aims of this proposal are to 1) estimate the influence of experiences of racism, experiences of violence during childhood and adolescence, and depressive symptoms to asthma incidence and 2) to estimate the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), racial segregation, and urbanicity to asthma incidence. We will conduct prospective analyses using data from the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS). The BWHS cohort, assembled in 1995, includes approximately 59,000 African-American women from across the U.S. Detailed information on demographics, medical and reproductive history, and disease endpoints including asthma, was collected at baseline and in biennial follow- up questionnaires. On selected follow-up questionnaires, information was obtained on the psychosocial factors of interest. Participant addresses have been geocoded and linked with census data. Over 16 years of follow-up through 2011, approximately 1800 incident cases of asthma will have been reported. The study is innovative because it will be the first prospective study to consider the effects of the psychosocial exposures of interest on incident adult asthma in African American women. The proposed research is significant because positive results may direct intervention efforts to address stressors like racism and violence and may motivate further mechanistic studies of how chronic stress leads to asthma, which might inform the development of new therapeutic interventions.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will identify psychosocial factors that contribute to asthma incidence in African American women and thus will fill gaps in knowledge about risk factors for adult-onset asthma and about reasons for the racial disparity in asthma morbidity in the US. Results from the proposed study have the potential to inform preventive strategies at the individual and societal level. Thus the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that seeks to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",Psychosocial Factors and the Risk of Incident Asthma in African American Women,8391713,R01HL107314,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Play ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Societies ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' War ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' density ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' racism ', ' Reproductive Issues ', ' Reproductive History Epidemiology ', ' Reproductive Factors ', ' Reproductive History ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' Severities ', ' interest ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Reporting ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' missing work ', ' Employee Absenteeism ', ' Absenteeism at work ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Psychosocial Effect ', ' Treatment/Psychosocial Effects ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Adult asthma ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' ']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2013,295990,0.42153646497831654
"Admixture mapping in African American Asthmatic Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: The candidate is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics in the Divisions of Asthma Research at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati. Upon completion of his quantitative genetics training, the candidate pursed statistical and human genetics fellowship programs at the University of Alabama Section on Statistical Genetics and the Human Genetics Center of Medical College of Wisconsin. These projects have been published in peer-review journals. Dr. Baye's overall research interest includes the use of quantitative and statistical genetics methods to dissect complex diseases particularly asthma and asthma-related allergy disorders. The long-term goals are to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality associated with asthma. Environment: At the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical center, the applicant will work with a highly collaborative multidisciplinary research team and will be fostered in an excellent academic environment offering outstanding educational programs for junior faculty members. The institution, through the Divisions of Asthma Research, Asthma Center, Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Biomedical Informatics and the Genetic Variation and Gene Discovery Core, provides all resources and facilities that are needed for the applicant's proposed research and is providing full access to all necessary resources to the applicant. The applicant will be provided 90% protected time to conduct the research proposed in this application. Research: This project aims to develop a program of study that would lead to an in depth understanding of the genome of African American (AA) admixed populations and develop procedures and methods for utilizing this information and SNP markers for linkage disequilibrium admixture mapping to localize asthma liability genes. The burden of asthma is disproportionately high among individuals of African descent. Due to recent admixture, AAs have a mixed parental genome contribution, with an average ratio of 80:20 for the proportion from African descent and European descent. This generates linkage disequilibrium (LD) among alleles on all chromosomes, which is detectable even at substantial distances (20-30 cM) using Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs). We plan to develop methods to exploit this LD that span along the genomes of AAs with asthma, in search for specific regions of unusually high African or European ancestry, thereby identifying the chromosomal segments that are likely to contain genes that are related to the disease liability. To achieve these goals, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) Investigate the genome of African American admixed population using our recently developed ancestry informative markers (Baye et al., 2009); 2) Estimate admixture proportions and evaluate differences between asthma cases and controls; 3) Apply these procedures to investigate whether genetic ancestral background at the 5q31 region is associated with asthma outcome measures. Hence, genotypic data from HapMap, Perlegen datasets and Greater Cincinnati Pediatric Clinic Cohort will be used to test the approach and enhance our ability to map asthma liability genes. Implications: This career development plan will foster Dr. Baye's development into an established independent expertise in complex disease and asthma genetics. The research will improve mapping of loci affecting complex traits in admixed populations, ultimately improving elucidation of the genetic architecture of complex human diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of asthma is disproportionately high among individuals of ethnic minorities. This project aims to develop procedures and methods for utilize the genome of admixed African American populations to localize asthma liability genes by modeling individual estimates of genetic admixture and socioeconomic status on measures of asthma. By gaining a better understanding of asthma risk factors in admixed minority populations, this proposal is consistent with the goals established by Healthy People 2010, which are to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population.

"Genetics of lung function and asthma severity in African Americans     DESCRIPTION: Severe, therapy-resistant asthma is a challenging disorder affecting ~10-15% of all asthmatics that is associated with persistent airway inflammation and progressive lung function deficits despite treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Although the mechanisms underlying severe asthma are poorly understood, racial disparities are evident among affected patients and suggest a potential role for genetics in the modulation of the disorder. In the U.S., African Americans are nearly twice as likely (compared to whites) to have current severe asthma independent of socioeconomic status, resulting in a two-fold increase in hospitalizations and a four-fold increase in asthma death. Furthermore, African Americans are twice as likely to have persistent airflow limitation and progressive loss of lung function despite equivalent treatment. However, African Americans have been poorly represented in asthma studies and thus there is an urgent need for research targeting African Americans to unravel the mechanisms and genetic underpinnings of severe asthma in this high-risk population. Although genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cross-sectional lung function measures in asthma patients, these studies were predominantly conducted in general populations of European whites and thus are of questionable relevance to African Americans. Furthermore, the clinical ""utility"" or ""meaningfulness"" of these SNPs in predicting other relevant asthma outcomes in this population remains unclear. Therefore, through a prospective, genotype- stratified cohort study, this application will determine whether SNPs in a panel of lung function genes predict asthma severity in African American children and adults with persistent asthma treated with ICS. The specific aims are to: 1) stratify and phenotype African American children and adults with persistent asthma by genotype 2) determine whether genotype predicts longitudinal asthma severity in African American children and adults with persistent asthma, and 3) refine the gene model for asthma severity in African American children and adults with ancestral genetic markers. Emory and Wake Forest have a long history of collaboration and together have led the initiative for phenotypic and genomic analyses of severe asthma. The findings generated here are expected to generate novel information on the contribution of genomic variants to severe asthma in African Americans. Given the increased morbidity associated with asthma in African Americans, these findings will lay important groundwork to advance personalized genomics approaches for this challenging and understudied population. This study is also in keeping with the mission of the NINR to improve quality of life by managing the symptoms of chronic illnesses (severe asthma) and to enhance research innovation through application of interdisciplinary approaches to improve the health of asthma patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of asthma is significantly greater in African Americans and is highlighted by increased asthma- related hospitalizations and deaths despite equivalent treatment.

"School-Based Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management (SB-TEAM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a first competing renewal of a school-based program designed to reduce morbidity for poor children with asthma by facilitating delivery of guideline-based care and improving adherence to effective preventive asthma medications. In 2006, we implemented the School Based Asthma Therapy (SBAT) trial (R01HL079954) with 530 children from more than 50 urban schools. The primary intervention for the SBAT trial consisted of directly observed administration of preventive asthma medications in school (with dose adjustments according to NHLBI guidelines). Results from this study demonstrate reduced morbidity, decreased absenteeism, and fewer exacerbations for these very high-risk children. This program has the potential to serve as a model for improved asthma care in urban communities, however several factors limit dissemination of the program in its current form. For example, extensive resources were required for screening and implementation of the program, and communications with providers for ongoing monitoring of symptoms were inefficient, often delaying recommended medication adjustments. In order for this program to have sustainable public health impact, we must now test a system that allows for full integration within the school and community systems that serve these children. In this new application we propose the next phase in our research, which represents a critical step in our expanding partnership with the city school district. We propose testing a novel school-based program (SB-TEAM - School-Based Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management), which directly builds on our prior work, for children with persistent asthma in Rochester City Elementary Schools.  We recently developed and pilot-tested the technology for web-based screening and communication for this intervention (RC1HL099432), and now propose a full-scale trial across an entire school district using this technology with the addition of telemedicin asthma assessments to assure appropriate follow-up care and optimal treatment. We hypothesize that children receiving care through SB-TEAM will experience less asthma- related morbidity compared to children in an enhanced usual care (eUC) comparison group. Further, we anticipate that the benefits will be even greater than those seen in the original SBAT trial, due t the ability to more optimally tailor each child's medication regimen. The SB-TEAM program includes systematic web-based asthma screening, directly observed administration of preventive asthma medications in school, and ongoing monitoring and tailoring of the care regimen using school-based telemedicine. Children in the eUC group will receive asthma screening with notification of their PCP, as well as systematic feedback to the parent and provider to promote appropriate guideline based follow-up care. This application represents a logical extension of our work to improve adherence to effective asthma medications that can reduce health disparities and could ultimately be sustained in communities nationwide.          Urban children with asthma suffer from substantial morbidity and suboptimal preventive care. This project may have a profound impact on public health because it proposes an expansion of an innovative school- based intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines that is specifically designed to promote optimal care within an existing infrastructure. Should it prove successful in reducing symptoms and improving the health of urban children with asthma, it has the potential to serve as a sustainable model for improved asthma care for this population.

"Genetic Susceptibility to Asthma and IndoorAir Pollution in Peru    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is an epidemic that disproportionately affects children, the poor and certain racial/ethnic groups. Latinos/Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the US and are disproportionately affected by asthma morbidity. From 1990 to 2000 there was an 81 percent increase in number of people that mark their ethnic origin as Peruvian on the US Census survey and the prevalence of asthma in Peru is among one of the highest in the world. Asthma is a complex disease and genetic risk for asthma and asthma morbidity may be modified by environmental exposures. The indoor environment is of particular concern as most people spend the majority of their time indoors. Investigators in this application have shown that high levels of indoor exposures, including particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), are independently associated with greater asthma morbidity, and are particularly high in Peruvian homes. The burden of asthma attributable to differences in domestic PM and NO2 concentrations is substantial; however, not all children are susceptible to effects of pollutant exposure and a large variation in response exists between individuals. These findings suggest a strong possibility of an interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental exposure in the development of asthma. To address the critical questions of the role of genetic susceptibility to the adverse effects of indoor air pollution on asthma, we will build upon the infrastructure and ongoing data collection efforts in Peru. We propose a candidate gene study to identify genetic variants associated with asthma and its associated traits (i.e., asthma severity, pulmonary function, airway inflammation) in relation to indoor air pollutant exposure in two Peruvian cities, Lima and Tumbes. We will prioritize candidate genes identified by published genome-wide association studies for asthma as well as those in the oxidative stress pathway thought to be relevant to pollutant exposure and asthma. We will cross-validate associations identified in well characterized asthma cases and controls from Lima, Peru (n=1,400), in a second independent population of asthmatic cases and controls recruited from Tumbes, Peru (n=400). Specific Aim #1: To identify genes associated with asthma in children in Peru. Specific Aim #2: To determine if genetic risk for asthma is modified by indoor air pollutant (PM, NO2) concentrations. We anticipate identifying candidate genes for asthma and associated traits relevant to both the general population as well as those contributing to disparities in asthma morbidity among individuals in Peru. Identifying subgroups of the population who are particularly vulnerable to air pollution is an important objective, as the results can be used to identify people most likely to benefit from exposure avoidance.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and over 300 million people suffer from asthma worldwide, suggesting a large public health burden. We anticipate identifying candidate genes for asthma and associated traits relevant to both the general population as well as those contributing to disparities in asthma morbidity among individuals in Peru.

"Genetics of lung function and asthma severity in African Americans     DESCRIPTION: Severe, therapy-resistant asthma is a challenging disorder affecting ~10-15% of all asthmatics that is associated with persistent airway inflammation and progressive lung function deficits despite treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Although the mechanisms underlying severe asthma are poorly understood, racial disparities are evident among affected patients and suggest a potential role for genetics in the modulation of the disorder. In the U.S., African Americans are nearly twice as likely (compared to whites) to have current severe asthma independent of socioeconomic status, resulting in a two-fold increase in hospitalizations and a four-fold increase in asthma death. Furthermore, African Americans are twice as likely to have persistent airflow limitation and progressive loss of lung function despite equivalent treatment. However, African Americans have been poorly represented in asthma studies and thus there is an urgent need for research targeting African Americans to unravel the mechanisms and genetic underpinnings of severe asthma in this high-risk population. Although genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cross-sectional lung function measures in asthma patients, these studies were predominantly conducted in general populations of European whites and thus are of questionable relevance to African Americans. Furthermore, the clinical ""utility"" or ""meaningfulness"" of these SNPs in predicting other relevant asthma outcomes in this population remains unclear. Therefore, through a prospective, genotype- stratified cohort study, this application will determine whether SNPs in a panel of lung function genes predict asthma severity in African American children and adults with persistent asthma treated with ICS. The specific aims are to: 1) stratify and phenotype African American children and adults with persistent asthma by genotype 2) determine whether genotype predicts longitudinal asthma severity in African American children and adults with persistent asthma, and 3) refine the gene model for asthma severity in African American children and adults with ancestral genetic markers. Emory and Wake Forest have a long history of collaboration and together have led the initiative for phenotypic and genomic analyses of severe asthma. The findings generated here are expected to generate novel information on the contribution of genomic variants to severe asthma in African Americans. Given the increased morbidity associated with asthma in African Americans, these findings will lay important groundwork to advance personalized genomics approaches for this challenging and understudied population. This study is also in keeping with the mission of the NINR to improve quality of life by managing the symptoms of chronic illnesses (severe asthma) and to enhance research innovation through application of interdisciplinary approaches to improve the health of asthma patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of asthma is significantly greater in African Americans and is highlighted by increased asthma- related hospitalizations and deaths despite equivalent treatment.

"Mentoring and Patient Oriented Research in Asthma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Dr. Diette is Associate Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he has joint appointments in Epidemiology and Environmental Health Sciences at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Since joining the faculty, Dr. Diette has served as mentor to more than 20 trainees, including 14 postdoctoral fellows.  With rare exception, his mentees have gone on to highly productive academic careers, garnering honors and receiving NIH grant support (NRSA, K23, R21, R01 U01 and Project Leader on program grants). The majority of his professional life has been dedicated to the conduct of research, presentation and dissemination of findings and establishing a steady base of research funding from the NIH and other sources. The focus of Dr. Diette's career has been on patient-oriented research in asthma, especially race-based health care disparities and environmental determinants of the disease. The main purpose of this K24 proposal is to provide relief from clinical and administrative duties in order to expand the POR program and dedicate additional time and energy to current and future trainees. Thus, the overall aims of this proposal are: Aim 1: To enhance the candidate's capacity to mentor clinician scientists in patient-oriented research; and Aim 2: To expand the candidate's clinical research program in directions that create new scientific opportunities for him and his mentees.          Dr. Diette directs the ASTHMA-DIET, a program award examining how diet contributes to asthma susceptibility in children and co-directs the Hopkins DISCOVER program, which investigates mechanisms by which allergens and pollutants provoke inflammation and oxidative stress. These programs are the research homes for his current mentees. These multi-project programs bring together broad scientific expertise from allergists, pulmonologists, adult and pediatric medicine, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, environmental health engineers and others. While substantial evidence now exists for the role of the indoor environment in pediatric asthma, there is insufficient evidence of the biologic mechanisms by which allergens and pollutants may provoke inflammation and oxidative stress in inner city adults.  As adults with asthma endure the majority (90%) of mortality attributed to the disease, treatments are inadequate, especially in the area of environmental control.  A major focus of this proposal will be to expand the present research program from inner city children to also include inner city adults. The proposed cohort of 100 inner city adults with asthma will examine the extent to which indoor particulate matter provokes oxidative stress and inflammation.  With this expansion in the research program, the candidate will provide the foundation for future trials in adults of home-based multi- component environmental interventions, goals which are concordant with the career goals of current mentees and will establish the infrastructure for future mentees with a research interest in adult asthma.        NARRATIVE  This award will have two major impacts on public health. First, it will expand the pool of researchers capable of patient oriented research, which is necessary for translation of research findings into viable asthma treatments. Second, the research program will add to the knowledge of how to reduce the burden of asthma in inner city adults, a group that suffers disproportionate morbidity and mortality from the disease.",Mentoring and Patient Oriented Research in Asthma,8685983,K24ES021098,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Allergens ', ' Appointment ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Award ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' IgE ', ' Inflammation ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Environmental Protection ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' inner city ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' member ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' NRSA ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' Adult asthma ', ' environmental intervention ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIEHS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2014,185487,0.3144499978171081
"Multi-Level Understanding of Social Contributors to SES Disparities in Asthma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in health outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES) are one of the most pressing public health problems our society faces today. In line with PAR-10-136's interest in multi-level approaches to understanding health disparities, we focus on childhood asthma and investigate factors simultaneously across neighborhood, family, and individual levels; we consider both physical environment and social environment exposures together; and we examine various levels of biological processes (organ systems, cellular, genomic) that drive asthma pathophysiology, all within a single project that seeks to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the causes of asthma disparities. The first aim is to understand how neighborhood, family, and individual-level social factors both shape and are shaped by one another, and how they collectively affect asthma disparities. The second aim is to measure social and physical exposures concurrently in order to explain how they interact to affect asthma disparities. The third aim is to create biologically plausible models for how social contexts contribute to health disparities by characterizing pathways at multiple levels biologicall (organ systems, cellular, genomic) that can explain how social contexts come to affect asthma disparities. This study will recruit a sample of 300 families from varying SES backgrounds who have a child ages 10-18 with persistent asthma. Families will participate in laboratory assessments of individual- and family-level social processes as well as child biological measures. Information on neighborhood characteristics will be linked from geographic information system maps of pollution exposures and maps of the social characteristics of communities created by a research consortium locally. In order to establish the temporal precedence of each of the 'levels' of factors, clinical outcomes will be tracked across a 1 year follow up period via monthly monitoring of symptoms as well as from hospitalization data obtained from provincial health records. Creating models that explain how neighborhood, family, and individual factors simultaneously contribute to asthma disparities is critical for developing a more holistic picture of how social contexts affect disease progression. These models will in turn shape our approaches to interventions. For example, interventions to improve medication adherence may not be effective if they do not acknowledge the broader social factors (e.g., neighborhood and family stress) that affect families' abilities to keep up with medication regimens. Assessing interactive effects between factors will also allow us to identify specific conditions under which potential targets of intervention would make the biggest differences in mitigating the pathophysiological processes underlying asthma. The overall goal of this project is to develop a more sophisticated understanding of why asthma disparities by SES exist and to identify the constellation of factors that would need to be targeted simultaneously in order to effectively alleviate these disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive, multi-level models that convincingly explain the multitude of ways in which low socioeconomic status (SES) is able to have pervasive effects on health are important for developing interventions that can maximally reduce health disparities. The proposed project will investigate social and physical environment factors across neighborhood, family, and individual levels in an effort to understand disparities by SES in childhood asthma. The overarching goal is to develop more sophisticated models of how social and physical environments affect and interact with one another to contribute to disease progression differentially in low SES children.",Multi-Level Understanding of Social Contributors to SES Disparities in Asthma,8726460,R01HL108723,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Allergens ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Shapes ', ' Pollution ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Exhalation ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' health record ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' airway epithelium infalmmation ', ' airway inflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' public health relevance ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,423419,0.30235554550389326
"Reducing Asthma Disparities Through School-Based Telemedicine for Rural Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma disproportionately burdens minority and low-income pediatric populations, and these disparities have persisted among high-risk children despite the dissemination of NHLBI asthma management guidelines more than a decade ago. Previous investigations suggest that asthma guidelines-based care has not translated to high-risk children living in rural regions. Asthma-related morbidity and non-adherence to asthma guidelines is prevalent among high-risk rural children living in the Mississippi Delta region of Arkansas, an impoverished and medically underserved region of the United States. Large-scale interventions to decrease asthma burden among high-risk rural children have not been designed, and interventions designed for other populations are not feasible due to distance and travel barriers and lack of subspecialty asthma services inherent to rural communities. The overall goal of the proposed project is to decrease asthma health outcomes disparities among high-risk children living in a rural, medically underserved environment. To address this goal, we propose conducting a cluster randomized trial with 540 children, ages 4-17 years, to implement a school-based telemedicine intervention in rural public school districts. The school-based intervention will provide comprehensive asthma education via telemedicine to rural children with asthma, their caregivers and school nurses; prospectively monitor asthma symptoms and lung function via telemedicine; and provide primary care providers with treatment prompts according to nationally published asthma guidelines. We hypothesize that children receiving school-based asthma education and monitoring via telemedicine in conjunction with a provider treatment prompt will have decreased asthma-related morbidity as compared to children receiving usual care. The aims of the project will: 1) examine the efficacy of a school-based asthma telemedicine intervention in improving asthma-related health outcomes in an intervention group compared to a usual care group; 2) examine the effects of a school-based asthma telemedicine intervention on asthma self-management skills; and 3) determine the cost of the intervention. Telemedicine will allow for the utilization of proven technology to deliver a state-of-the-art asthma intervention in a high-risk population and will significantly reduce challenges associated with distance and travel barriers inherent to rural communities. An innovative telemedicine approach to improve asthma health outcomes among high-risk rural children has high impact potential because findings from the proposed intervention will directly inform public health strategies to implement large-scale telemedicine services in a school-based setting. The intervention will have direct applicability to other high-risk asthma populations in rural and medically underserved regions and can be translated to school-based health intervention strategies to target other chronic health conditions.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project may have a profound impact on public health because it presents a practical school-based intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines. Should it prove successful in reducing symptoms and improving the health of rural children with asthma, it has the potential to serve as a model for improved asthma care in other medically underserved communities.

"Combined Transcriptomics and Genomics to Find Asthma Genes in Admixed Populations  African American individuals are more likely to develop asthma and are nearly three times as likely to experience serious asthma complications when compared with European American individuals. Genome wide association studies have identified a number of genetic risk markers for asthma, but many of the associations observed in European and European American patients have not replicated in African American individuals. This may be the result of allele frequencies, linkage disequilibria, or disease-related genes which differ by ancestry. Detailed characterization of the transcriptome can aid in the identification of asthma-related genes by circumventing some of the aforementioned problems associated with genotype association alone. Therefore, this proposal seeks to combine transcriptomics and genomics to identify asthma-related genes and the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) which appear to regulate these genes. We propose using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptome of African American individuals with and without asthma. RNA-seq is superior to traditional microarrays at quantifying transcript abundance, but this method has not been widely used in U.S. minority populations to date. The Study of Asthma Phenotypes and Pharmacogenomic Interactions by Race-ethnicity (SAPPHIRE) cohort is an ideal group in which combine these analytic approaches. In addition to being one of largest and best characterized asthma cohorts in the U.S., genome wide genotype data and banked whole blood RNA already exist for a large number of SAPPHIRE participants. In Specific Aim 1, we will use RNA-seq to identify expression differences in previously identified asthma-related genes among African American individuals by asthma status. Pre-existing genotype data will then be used to identify eQTL for these differentially expressed, asthma-associated genes. In Specific Aim 2, we will use admixture mapping to identify chromosomal regions where ancestry is associated with asthma. The genes in these regions will be interrogated for differential expression by asthma status. The resulting potentially novel, ancestry-specific asthma genes will also be assessed for eQTL. As a subset of African American SAPPHIRE participants have RNA collected at both their initial evaluation and the time of an asthma exacerbation, in Specific Aim 3 we will assess whether the genes identified in the preceding aims are also associated with asthma exacerbations. Lastly, Specific Aim 4 will attempt to replicate our findings in a separate group of African American participants with and without asthma. In summary, asthma is a complex disease with potentially distinct genetic predictors by ancestry. Persisting inequities in asthma complications by race-ethnicity underscore the need for improved disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. As a step in this direction, we proffer an integrative approach with greater statistical power to identify asthma-related genes and their regulatory elements. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although African Americans are more likely to be affected by asthma and its complications, less is known about the genetics of asthma in this group as compared with European Americans. This project will identify new asthma-related genes by using the genetic diversity of African Americans and recent advances in measuring gene expression. Through this combined approach we anticipate finding new targets to better diagnose and manage asthma.            ",Combined Transcriptomics and Genomics to Find Asthma Genes in Admixed Populations,8629342,R01HL118267,"['Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Chromosome 17 ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17 ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Technics ', ' Genetic Techniques ', ' Genotype ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Respiratory Function Tests ', ' Lung Function Tests ', ' Pulmonary function tests ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Genetic ', ' Whole Blood ', ' Complex ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Population Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Population Group ', ' TSLP ', ' TSLP gene ', ' MAP-Kinase Activating Death Domain Gene ', ' KIAA0358 ', ' IG20 ', ' DENN ', ' MADD gene ', ' Health system ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' Transcript ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' transcriptomics ', ' therapeutic target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' ']",NHLBI,HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM,R01,2014,741390,0.34107129199344904
"School-Based Asthma Care for Teens (SB-ACT)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood, and despite current advances in therapies, morbidity and mortality continue to increase. Low-income, minority teenagers have disproportionately high rates of asthma morbidity, including excess risk of emergency department care, hospitalization, and death from asthma, compared to white adolescents. Although urban children suffer the largest burden from asthma, they are the least likely group to receive adequate preventive care, and poor adherence plays a significant contributing role in asthma morbidity. Inner city adolescents with asthma are at particular risk of nonadherence.  Thus, there is a substantial amount of suffering that could be prevented with improvements in care. This application builds on our extensive experience with efficacious school-based programs for urban children and teens with asthma. The overall goal is to broadly disseminate a novel system of asthma care throughout the entire city school district ('School Based Asthma Care for Teens'; SBACT), and test its effectiveness in improving adherence and reducing morbidity among urban teens.  The SB-ACT intervention includes two core components. First, adolescents visit the school nurse daily for 6-8 weeks at the start of the school year to receive a trial of directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medications. The goal is for the teen to establish a relationship with the nurse, learn proper medication technique, and experience the benefits and value of daily preventive therapy. Four to 6 weeks after the initiation of DOT, the teen will receive a motivational interviewing (MI) counseling program designed to  enhance the teen's motivation to transition to independent, sustained preventive medication use. We will train community-based nurses affiliated with the local American Lung Association to deliver the MI component. The MI nurse will conduct three counseling sessions with the teen at school, which are designed to capitalize on the teen's experience with DOT and the potential benefits they experienced. Given the complex nature of  asthma care in this population, we plan to evaluate this intervention using a 3-group design in which 430 teens  will be randomly assigned to either; 1) the SB-ACT program (trial of DOT for 6-8 weeks + 3 MI counseling  sessions); 2) DOT-only (DOT only for 6-8 weeks); or 3) an asthma education (AE) comparison group (in-school  asthma education delivered by a trained asthma educator). We include the DOT-only group to evaluate whether this component alone is sufficient to promote sustained adherence without counseling. The AE group is designed to enhance asthma care and control for the attention received in MI counseling. We will assess the effectiveness of the SB-ACT intervention in reducing asthma morbidity, perform an economic sustainability analysis, and evaluate each component of program implementation with a focus on sustainability and dissemination. At the completion of the study, the effectiveness of this system of school-based asthma care will be better defined as a sustainable means to improve care for adolescents and reduce health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urban adolescents with asthma suffer from substantial morbidity and suboptimal preventive care. This project may have a profound impact on public health because it proposes the implementation of an innovative, efficacious intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines throughout an entire urban school district.

"Asthma and Physical Activity in Urban Children: Cultural and Contextual Factors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric health disparities in the area of asthma, obesity and cardiovascular fitness continue to exist. Specifically, asthma and obesity are highly prevalent co-morbid conditions that disproportionately affect ethnic minority and urban children. These conditions share pathophysiological (e.g., inflammatory mediators) and contextual (living in an urban neighborhood) correlates, which may increase the risk for both conditions. A key lifestyle behavior implicated in both asthma morbidity and obesity risk is physical activity. Some children with asthma tend to restrict overall activities, including physical activity, when symptoms are in poor control. Although stressors related to urban living may also serve as barriers to physical activity among this group, we know little about the potential cultural and contextual mechanisms that help explain the association between asthma and physical activity in ethnic minority children. This ancillary study offers a unique opportunity to examine the association between asthma, physical activity and cultural and contextual factors in a group of urban children who are followed as part of their participation in Project NAPS (Nocturnal Asthma and Performance in School (R01 HD057220; Koinis Mitchell, PI).  Project NAPS includes three, 4-week assessment periods (Session 1, S2, & S3) over the course of one academic year. In this ancillary study, we will incorporate objectively measured physical activity, and perceptions of asthma, physical activity and context to the third assessment period (S3), and add a fourth assessment period (S4) to occur at the start of the following academic year. This additional time point will provide: 1) an opportunity to examine the co-occurrence of asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms, physical activity, and sedentary behavior, and 2) an in depth examination (at S3 and S4) of potential cultural and contextual influences on physical activity in a sample of 150 children with persistent asthma who are overweight/obese or healthy weight.  We hypothesize that children with more asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms will participate in less moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and more sedentary activities. These associations will be more pronounced in children from Latino and AA backgrounds than in Non-Latino White children. We further hypothesize that fear related to asthma and perceptions of neighborhood safety will each be independent predictors of MVPA, and will predict activity levels beyond actual asthma symptom level and measured neighborhood characteristics. We also expect these associations will be more pronounced in caregivers from Latino and AA backgrounds. Finally, we hypothesize that caregivers' perception of exercise as a trigger for asthma will be related to less MVPA and more sedentary behavior. This association will be apparent even when accounting for children's actual exercise-induced brochospasm status (EIB). A similar pattern will be found for children's perceptions. This association will be more pronounced in caregivers and children of Latino and AA backgrounds.  This line of research has significant implications for the development of cultural tailored interventions to: increase physical activity n urban children with persistent asthma; and improve caregiver understanding of asthma symptoms and exercise induced-bronchospasm. Ultimately, study findings could have implications for improving the standard of care for urban and ethnic minority children with persistent asthma.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pediatric health disparities in the area of asthma, obesity and cardiovascular fitness continue to exist. Asthma and obesity are highly prevalent co-morbid conditions that disproportionately affect ethnic minority and urban children. Physical activity is  key lifestyle behavior implicated in both asthma morbidity and obesity risk. Further, little is known about the potential cultural and contextual factors that help explain the association between asthma and physical activity in urban and ethnic minority children. Focusing on modifiable factors is a critical step in understanding and ultimately decreasing the health burden related to asthma, obesity and poor cardiovascular health. Results from this study will inform the development of a culturally tailored intervention that targets strategies for increasing physical activity, decreasing sedentary behavior, controlling asthma symptoms, and addressing potential caregiver misperceptions in a sample that is disproportionately burdened by the health risks of obesity and asthma.            ",Asthma and Physical Activity in Urban Children: Cultural and Contextual Factors,8703766,R01HL116254,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Rhinitis allergic atopic ', ' Atopic rhinitis ', ' Allergic rhinosinusitis ', ' Allergic rhinitis due to allergen ', ' Allergic rhinitis ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Rhinitis ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Time ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' inflammatory mediator ', ' Inflammation Mediators ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' instrument ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' elementary school ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Nocturnal Asthma ', ' conditioning ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' obesity risk ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' ']",NHLBI,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2014,398411,0.36474379883898245
"Admixture mapping in African American Asthmatic Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: The candidate is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics in the Divisions of Asthma Research at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati. Upon completion of his quantitative genetics training, the candidate pursed statistical and human genetics fellowship programs at the University of Alabama Section on Statistical Genetics and the Human Genetics Center of Medical College of Wisconsin. These projects have been published in peer-review journals. Dr. Baye's overall research interest includes the use of quantitative and statistical genetics methods to dissect complex diseases particularly asthma and asthma-related allergy disorders. The long-term goals are to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality associated with asthma. Environment: At the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical center, the applicant will work with a highly collaborative multidisciplinary research team and will be fostered in an excellent academic environment offering outstanding educational programs for junior faculty members. The institution, through the Divisions of Asthma Research, Asthma Center, Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Biomedical Informatics and the Genetic Variation and Gene Discovery Core, provides all resources and facilities that are needed for the applicant's proposed research and is providing full access to all necessary resources to the applicant. The applicant will be provided 90% protected time to conduct the research proposed in this application. Research: This project aims to develop a program of study that would lead to an in depth understanding of the genome of African American (AA) admixed populations and develop procedures and methods for utilizing this information and SNP markers for linkage disequilibrium admixture mapping to localize asthma liability genes. The burden of asthma is disproportionately high among individuals of African descent. Due to recent admixture, AAs have a mixed parental genome contribution, with an average ratio of 80:20 for the proportion from African descent and European descent. This generates linkage disequilibrium (LD) among alleles on all chromosomes, which is detectable even at substantial distances (20-30 cM) using Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs). We plan to develop methods to exploit this LD that span along the genomes of AAs with asthma, in search for specific regions of unusually high African or European ancestry, thereby identifying the chromosomal segments that are likely to contain genes that are related to the disease liability. To achieve these goals, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) Investigate the genome of African American admixed population using our recently developed ancestry informative markers (Baye et al., 2009); 2) Estimate admixture proportions and evaluate differences between asthma cases and controls; 3) Apply these procedures to investigate whether genetic ancestral background at the 5q31 region is associated with asthma outcome measures. Hence, genotypic data from HapMap, Perlegen datasets and Greater Cincinnati Pediatric Clinic Cohort will be used to test the approach and enhance our ability to map asthma liability genes. Implications: This career development plan will foster Dr. Baye's development into an established independent expertise in complex disease and asthma genetics. The research will improve mapping of loci affecting complex traits in admixed populations, ultimately improving elucidation of the genetic architecture of complex human diseases.        The burden of asthma is disproportionately high among individuals of ethnic minorities. This project aims to develop procedures and methods for utilize the genome of admixed African American populations to localize asthma liability genes by modeling individual estimates of genetic admixture and socioeconomic status on measures of asthma.

"School-Based Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management (SB-TEAM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a first competing renewal of a school-based program designed to reduce morbidity for poor children with asthma by facilitating delivery of guideline-based care and improving adherence to effective preventive asthma medications. In 2006, we implemented the School Based Asthma Therapy (SBAT) trial (R01HL079954) with 530 children from more than 50 urban schools. The primary intervention for the SBAT trial consisted of directly observed administration of preventive asthma medications in school (with dose adjustments according to NHLBI guidelines). Results from this study demonstrate reduced morbidity, decreased absenteeism, and fewer exacerbations for these very high-risk children. This program has the potential to serve as a model for improved asthma care in urban communities, however several factors limit dissemination of the program in its current form. For example, extensive resources were required for screening and implementation of the program, and communications with providers for ongoing monitoring of symptoms were inefficient, often delaying recommended medication adjustments. In order for this program to have sustainable public health impact, we must now test a system that allows for full integration within the school and community systems that serve these children. In this new application we propose the next phase in our research, which represents a critical step in our expanding partnership with the city school district. We propose testing a novel school-based program (SB-TEAM - School-Based Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management), which directly builds on our prior work, for children with persistent asthma in Rochester City Elementary Schools.  We recently developed and pilot-tested the technology for web-based screening and communication for this intervention (RC1HL099432), and now propose a full-scale trial across an entire school district using this technology with the addition of telemedicin asthma assessments to assure appropriate follow-up care and optimal treatment. We hypothesize that children receiving care through SB-TEAM will experience less asthma- related morbidity compared to children in an enhanced usual care (eUC) comparison group. Further, we anticipate that the benefits will be even greater than those seen in the original SBAT trial, due t the ability to more optimally tailor each child's medication regimen. The SB-TEAM program includes systematic web-based asthma screening, directly observed administration of preventive asthma medications in school, and ongoing monitoring and tailoring of the care regimen using school-based telemedicine. Children in the eUC group will receive asthma screening with notification of their PCP, as well as systematic feedback to the parent and provider to promote appropriate guideline based follow-up care. This application represents a logical extension of our work to improve adherence to effective asthma medications that can reduce health disparities and could ultimately be sustained in communities nationwide.          Urban children with asthma suffer from substantial morbidity and suboptimal preventive care. This project may have a profound impact on public health because it proposes an expansion of an innovative school- based intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines that is specifically designed to promote optimal care within an existing infrastructure. Should it prove successful in reducing symptoms and improving the health of urban children with asthma, it has the potential to serve as a sustainable model for improved asthma care for this population.

"Vitamin D, Steroids, and Asthma in African American Youth  Abstract  Further studies are urgently needed in order to identify effective and sustainable strategies for reducing the dramatic health disparities experienced by disadvantaged, urban, and minority youth with asthma. Vitamin D deficiency is more common among African American (AA) individuals, especially those from urban environments or with obesity. We and others have contributed to increasing evidence that vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to more severe asthma through increased risk of respiratory infection and decreased glucocorticoid sensitivity. Indeed, low vitamin D levels were recently linked with the need for exogenous glucocorticoids and increased asthma severity. Particularly relevant to health disparities, we showed a strong association between vitamin D insufficiency and asthma in urban African American (AA) youth. Because AA youth residing in urban Washington, DC have markedly worse asthma than other racial/ethnic groups (e.g. prevalence rate 20% higher than the national rate 15 and emergency department utilization rates up to 5 times the national rates and nearly 10 times the Healthy People 2010 target rate), we will utilize our access to this population at the extreme of asthma disparities to examine the contribution of vitamin D to disparities in the chronic control and acute severity of asthma. The overall goal of this application is to provide critical epidemiological/molecular information that will inform the interpretation of ongoing and impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma. The knowledge generated by the experiments in this application will be crucial to translation of this inexpensive, easily-accessible potential therapy for asthma. We hypothesize that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels are associated with poor chronic asthma control, worse acute asthma severity, and glucocorticoid insensitivity. AIM 1. Define asthma phenotypic clusters and determine cross- sectional inter- and intra-cluster associations with serum 25(OH)D levels within and between AA and non-AA youth. AIM 2. Determine prospective associations among serum 25(OH)D levels and: (a) chronic asthma control and (b) acute asthma severity within and between AA and non-AA youth. AIM 3. Show the effect of vitamin D on glucorticoid regulation of inflammatory mediators in asthmatic airway epithelial cells.  Narrative  The overall goal of this application is to provide critical epidemiological/molecular information that will inform the interpretation of ongoing and impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma. The knowledge generated by the experiments in this application will be crucial to translation of this inexpensive, easily-accessible potential therapy for asthma.","Vitamin D, Steroids, and Asthma in African American Youth",8607477,R01MD007075,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Cells ', ' auricularum ', ' Visumetazone ', ' Spersadox ', ' Spersadex ', ' Predni-F ', ' Orgadrone ', ' Ocasa ', ' Mymethasone ', ' Millicorten ', ' Methylfluorprednisolone ', ' Loverine ', ' Lokalison-F ', ' Hexadrol ', ' Hexadecadrol ', ' Gammacorten ', ' Fortecortin ', ' Fluorodelta ', ' Dinormon ', ' Dexone ', ' Dexinoral ', ' Dexapos ', ' Dexamonozon ', ' Dexamethasonum ', ' Dexameth ', ' Dexamecortin ', ' Dexalocal ', ' Dexafluorene ', ' Dexafarma ', ' Dexacortin ', ' Dexacortal ', ' Dexace ', ' Dexa-sine ', ' Dexa-Scheroson ', ' Dexa-Rhinosan ', ' Dexa-Mamallet ', ' Dex-4 ', ' Desameton ', ' Desamethasone ', ' Deronil ', ' Deltafluorene ', ' Dekacort ', ' Deenar ', ' Dectancyl ', ' Decasone R.p.

"Improving Asthma Control through mHealth-Based Home Monitoring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disadvantaged, urban, and minority children incur a disproportionate share of asthma prevalence and morbidity. Interventions have been shown to improve underrepresented minority (URM) youths' adherence to NIH asthma care guidelines (e.g., proper use of long-term control medication) thereby reducing asthma morbidity. One particularly promising method of intervention delivery is via mobile technology-it is widely accessed by urban minority parents and children, and it is a cost effective and efficient tool for monitoring, providing feedback, and thereby changing health behavior. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that racial disparities in asthma morbidity may be due in part to children's home environments; indoor air quality can have an important influence on asthma-related health because children spend as much as 90% of their time indoors. Therefore, we propose to develop a mobile health (mHealth) tool intended to help urban, minority families independently identify and address asthma triggers in their homes and improve their child's asthma self- management. In the proposed project, we will apply an iterative, user-centered design process to develop a prototype asthma home monitoring system (Aspira) involving a tablet app, digital spirometer, and particulate monitor, linked to a data management server. To this end, we will conduct key informant interviews, develop user personas, hold team design workshops, develop an integrated data management platform, and conduct usability testing of low-fidelity prototypes. Then we will conduct a mixed-methods pilot study to determine feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the resulting high-fidelity Aspira prototype among ten African American parents and their children (ages 7-12) with asthma living in Washington, DC. The successful completion of this project will show the feasibility of our concept and set the stage for system improvements, a randomized control trial and commercialization efforts in Phase II.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To address the disparity in pediatric asthma morbidity, we propose to develop and conduct preliminary feasibility testing of a mobile health (mHealth) tool designed to help urban, minority families independently identify and address asthma triggers in their homes and improve their child's asthma self-management. The tool consists of 3 components: a (1) mobile-device software application that prompts the child to record lung function using a (2) spirometer, in addition to storing continuously-measured air quality data from an (3) in- home particulate monitor. The app will link lung function and air quality information in order to provide families with real time notifications of risk for asthma exacerbation, thereby improving urban, minority families' ability to proactively manage their child's asthma.                 ",Improving Asthma Control through mHealth-Based Home Monitoring,8722702,R41MD008832,"['Absenteeism ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Air ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Text2Breathe: Enhance Parent Communication to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases, such as asthma, disproportionately affect African American (AA) children. A key recommendation of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma is partnership between healthcare providers and patients (and their parents, for children). Facilitating parents' open communication with providers regarding healthcare status and concerns can equip them to more effectively partner with their child's primary care provider (PCP). Thus, improving the health communication skills of African American (AA) parents could improve parent's adherence to treatment recommendations including utilization of the primary care for asthma care, and ultimately improve their child's asthma health outcomes. Our team recently completed a randomized controlled trial of an in- person health communication intervention that resulted in more partnerships with PCPs for asthma care and lower urgent care usage, but effects were not sustained past 2 months post-intervention. Mobile technology, such as Short Message Service (SMS, ""text messaging""), is a low-cost means of extending the dosage and scope of this intervention and may be particularly useful among AAs, for whom the use of SMS is widespread. The proposed study involves a SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention (Text2Breathe) designed to equip urban, low-income AA parents with tools/techniques to empower parents to more effectively communicate with their children's PCP. 268 AA parents of children attending an emergency department asthma education clinic will be randomized to usual care or Text2Breathe. The Text2Breathe group will receive ongoing individualized text messages providing instruction about asthma care communication during the year- long intervention period. Outcome data on parental self-efficacy and outcome expectations, adherence to asthma care treatment recommendations (e.g., primary care utilization), and child asthma outcomes will be collected via structured telephone interviews at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-enrollment. This trial can reduce pediatric health disparities by verifying the efficacy of a SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention that can extend to other chronic conditions and have health and policy implications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this text messaging intervention is to equip African American parents to effectively communicate with primary care providers about their child's asthma care needs. Increasing parents' self-efficacy is expected to enhance their adherence to treatment recommendations, specifically utilization of primary care and self- management, and thus improve children's asthma health outcomes. Results of the trial of this intervention can have broad impact on reducing pediatric health disparities because, if efficacious, this SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention can be extended to other chronic disease contexts where parent- provider communication is important.                ",Text2Breathe: Enhance Parent Communication to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities,8773802,R01MD007740,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"AsthmaNet:  Phenotypic Influences on Asthma Treatments     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Pittsburgh AsthmaNet proposal includes 3 protocols, with a 4th mechanistic protocol built around unmet asthma needs and phenotyping. These protocols should contribute to understanding asthma phenotypes in relation to mechanisms and specific treatment, particularly in relation to health disparities and contributions from race, socioeconomic status (SES) and asthma severity. These protocols build on our inherent expertise in asthma phenotyping and biology, racial/ethnic/socioeconomic issues, environmental effects, particularly in relation to underserved populations, psychosocial stress, and severe asthma. Our proposal includes participation from the Center for Minority Health with expertise in outreach in minority populations, a partner at Rainbow Babies of Case Western Reserve and a satellite at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. The 1st clinical trial will compare two approved drugs for treatment of the adult onset asthma phenotype, which hypothesizes that a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor will be more effective than a leukotriene receptor antagonist. The 2nd study evaluates the role of race in relation to SES on corticosteroid (CS) responses in children, h3TJ0thesizing that the African-American asthma phenotype, with and without regard to SES, predicts a poor response to inhaled CSs in asthmatic children. Vitamin D supplementation will overcome the poor response and improve outcomes. We will recruit African American and Caucasian children stratified by race and SES. Children who remain symptomatic following initial stabilization will be treated with high dose ICS and response determined. Children of all groups who do not improve will be randomized to treatment with Vitamin D or higher ICS dose to determine whether Vitamin D + lower dose ICS improves exacerbations and CS responsiveness better or to the same degree than the higher dose ICS. The mechanistic ancillary protocol will address whether aspects of CS unresponsiveness can be modeled in vitro, including effects of race/SES factors on cytokine suppression and histones, and the effect of Vitamin D to improve them.

"Peer-Administered Asthma Self-Management Intervention in Urban Middle Schools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities in pediatric asthma exist, with Latino children of Puerto Rican descent demonstrating increased asthma morbidity and mortality. The morbidity levels of middle school children are higher than children from any other age group. The goal of this R21 application is to develop and test a 4-session, peer- facilitated asthma self-management intervention for Latino, middle school-aged (6th-8th graders) children in urban public school settings. Our intervention, ASMAS (Asthma Self-Management in Schools) will be designed to be administered by trained and supervised High School juniors and seniors of Latino descent with asthma to a group of younger peers with asthma (11-13 years of age). The ASMAS intervention will be implemented in two areas that contain a high prevalence of urban and Latino children with asthma: San Juan, Puerto Rico and Providence, Rhode Island. The first AIM of this application is to develop the asthma self-management intervention and intervention procedures to make them culturally consistent with Latino students' background, and applicable to the school setting, for the RCT/R01. Focus groups will be conducted with students, HS Peers, and school personnel in both sites, and Investigators with expertise in asthma education and self- management, school-based interventions, and culturally tailored treatments, will provide input. The second AIM is to test the intervention through a Pilot Randomized Control Trial to provide estimates of effect size that will be used to inform the sample size for the RCT/R01 (6 groups per site; 3 groups of each condition, per site). We will recruit 30 Latino children with asthma per site, and randomly assign them to the ASMAS intervention or the Asthma Education plus Child Health control condition (3 groups of each condition, per site). We expect that participants in the ASMAS intervention will have improved asthma self-management (improved self- management skills, asthma knowledge and self-efficacy, available rescue inhaler and asthma action plan with school nurse), relative to the control condition. We also anticipate that participants in the ASMAS intervention will have improved asthma outcomes (greater reduction of symptoms, fewer asthma-related absences, improved asthma control and asthma-related quality of life), relative to the control condition.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is a common chronic illness in which urban Latino children are disproportionately affected. A novel intervention that tailors school-based asthma self-management for use with Latino children in urban public school settings and is facilitated by a Latino, High School Peer with Asthma has the potential to improve asthma management and outcomes for children who are at significant risk for morbidity.            ",Peer-Administered Asthma Self-Management Intervention in Urban Middle Schools,8700446,R21HD074855,"['Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Language ', ' Magic ', ' Manuals ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Play ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Sample Size ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' age group ', ' elementary school ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' high school junior ', ' 11th grade ', ' eleventh grade ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' junior high school ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Dominican ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' rescue inhaler ', ' asthma reliever ', ' asthma controller ', ' asthma MDI ', ' asthma inhaler ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' 13 year old ', ' treatment effect ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Middle School Student ', ' ']",NICHD,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R21,2014,229520,0.4131556472417888
"The autophagic pathway and atopic asthma: role of IL-33 and ST2     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma represents a major public health burden characterized as an epidemic that disproportionately affects underrepresented minorities and children. The usual source of the lower airway inflammation characteristic of asthma is a Th2-mediated reaction initiated by common environmental allergens. Multiple independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on asthma have identified, as the most consistently associated genes with asthma among diverse ethnic/racial groups. However, the biological role and mechanism of IL-33/ST2 in modulating the innate-adaptive immunity interaction in asthma remains to be defined. Recent evidence suggests that IL-33-activated dendritic cells (DCs) are critical for Th2- mediated allergic airway inflammation. Moreover, autophagy is a core cellular process that contributes to cellular homeostasis with emerging links to the pathogenesis of asthma. Autophagy is involved in the delivery of potential cytoplasmic antigens to the endosome for degradation, processing, activation and presentation by DCs; and its activity is increased in asthmatic airways. We hypothesize that both the IL-33/ST2 and autophagic pathways play a crucial role in asthma and allergic diseases and IL-33/ST2 modulates the innate-adaptive immunity interaction via autophagy in Th2-mediated allergic airway inflammation. We have completed targeted resequencing of ST2 to identify rare variants as well as common variation that is not well ""tagged"" by the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the GWAS platforms in populations of African ancestry. We identified a novel and common haplotype that determines serum levels of soluble ST2 (sST2), which is comprised of three promoter variants that potentially alter transcription factor binding. In silico analyses of asthma GWAS databases identify 11 out of 84 selected key autophagic pathway genes for which variants are significantly associated with risk of asthma in African Americans, suggesting variation in this pathway may universally contribute to asthma risk. In the parent R01 grant to this new application, we have nearly completed whole-genome sequencing of >1,000 asthma cases and non-asthmatic controls comprising the 'Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas' (CAAPA). The resulting unique catalog of genetic variation in >1,000 individuals of African ancestry selected for asthma provides a unique opportunity to identify common and rare variants in the IL-33/ST2 and autophagic pathways. Specific aims of this application are:  (i) To identify rare and common variants in 84 autophagic pathway genes associated with asthma; and (ii) To test IL-33/ST2-mediated autophagic flux as a critical determinant of dendritic cell homeostasis and the mechanisms by which IL-33/ST2 regulates the innate-adaptive immunity interaction in asthmatic patients and non-asthmatic controls (N=20 each group). Results from these studies will provide insight into the pathogenesis, the genetic underpinnings and ethnic disparities of asthma as well as novel targets for therapy in the clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Both the IL-33/ST2 and autophagic pathways play a crucial role in Th2-mediated responses in atopic asthma. We have identified polymorphisms in autophagic pathway genes associated with asthma and ST2 haplotype- specific regulation of serum levels of soluble ST2. We will test whether the autophagic pathway as a whole may control risk to asthma, and test whether IL-33/ST2 modulates the innate-adaptive immunity interaction via autophagy.            ",The

"Healthy Learning, Healthy Living Healthy Lives     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to white Americans, African Americans live sicker and die younger. Although the magnitudes of racial socioeconomic status (SES) disparities in morbidity and mortality are often largest among adults, they often begin in childhood. In fact, past research reveals that, ""[racial disparities in U.S. child disease prevalene rates have been observed for obesity, asthma, diabetes, preterm birth, infant death, mental health, birth defects, physical abuse, injury, low birth weight, all-cause mortality, and disabilit."" Accordingly, efforts to eliminate race and SES disparities in health among adults should begin with efforts to prevent and intervene in health disparities among children. America's most prevalent chronic pediatric health condition is asthma. Asthma is also a significant source of race and SES disparities in health, and a correlate, cause and/or consequence of disparities in children's psychosocial stress exposures, academic outcomes, physical living conditions, and other structural, environmental and social factors. The proposed Healthy Living, Healthy Learning, Healthy Lives (HL3) Project equitably engages community and academic partners in an effort to investigate, ameliorate and ultimately eliminate, disparities in children's health, wih a particular focus on asthma, its correlates, consequences and co-morbidities. The Specific Aims of the project are as follows: 1) to strengthen and expand the health focus of an existing community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership. 2) To use the HL3 CBPR partnership to plan and implement a multi-level (individual, family, school, neighborhood, policy) community assessment. 3) To use the results of the community assessment (Aim 2) to plan a multi-level pilot CBPR intervention. 4) To use the intervention plan (Aim 3) to implement a multi-level pilot CBPR intervention study. 5) To evaluate the process and outcomes of the HL3 Project's three-year intervention planning process.         RELEVANCE: To strengthen and expand an existing community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership, and to use this partnership to refine the social determinants of health conceptual framework and design, implement and evaluate a multi-level (individual, family, school, neighborhood, policy) community assessment and intervention plan with an initial focus on asthma, its correlates, consequences and co-morbidities.

"A Self-Regulation Intervention for Older Adults with Asthma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma in older adults has been overlooked, understudied, and inadequately treated. While asthma programs targeting the unique needs of children, teenagers, women, minorities, and other populations have been successfully developed, there are currently none for older adults. This is particularly distressing as the asthma hospitalization rates, mortality rates, quality of life, and control are significantly worsein the elderly as compared to other age groups. It is clear that novel approaches are needed to improve the care in this population.  Our group has been active in the research of asthma in the elderly. We have analyzed national asthma data sets to look for disparities in older adults, have conducted qualitative research to determine factors associated with poor control in the elderly, and have performed a pilot study of a self- regulation intervention which was able to improve outcomes. We also have over 20 years of experience in asthma self-regulation interventions and physician communication enhancement for multiple populations of asthma patients. We will combine these strengths into our current protocol.  The intervention program will be based on the self-regulation theory of behavior, which will enhance the participants' ability to self-manage this chronic condition, actively involve the participant in their own health care management, and produce sustained results. In this application, we will evaluate a self-regulation asthma intervention in a diverse population of older adults. The intervention will be personalized to the challenges and goals each individual faces, which will enhance its applicability in different populations. This intervention will incorporate standard asthma education, complementary techniques for which older adults have expressed a strong interest, and enhanced communication with each participant's physician. Asthma specific outcomes will be assessed at one, six, and 12 months. The primary goal of this intervention is to decrease health care utilization (emergency department, urgent care, hospital, and unscheduled visits) for older adults with asthma. We will also assess the ability to improve quality of life, asthma symptoms, asthma control, lung function parameters, self-efficacy, and cost effectiveness.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because adverse asthma outcomes disproportionally affect older adults, yet very little research has been directed towards this population. The proposed intervention directly addresses the National Institute on Aging's mission of extending and improving the healthy, active years of life.            ",A Self-Regulation Intervention for Older Adults with Asthma,8678811,R01AG043401,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Locales ', ' Respiratory Function Tests ', ' Lung Function Tests ', ' Pulmonary function tests ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Motivation ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Spirometry ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Sample Size ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Exhalation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' respiratory ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' urgent care ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,312035,0.2839664889054269
"Mechanisms of IL-17A-mediated enhancement of asthma severity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lung that currently afflicts more than 300 million people worldwide. While asthma is mediated by an excessive Th2 immune response to allergens, recent evidence suggests that production of the Th17 cytokine, IL-17A, is associated with the development of more severe disease. While severe asthmatics are at greatest risk for morbidity or death following acute exacerbations, and can be refractory to therapies that are highly effective in individuals with mild disease, the molecular mechanisms whereby IL-17A contributes to the development of severe allergic asthma are ill-defined. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A facilitates severe asthma would provide additional therapeutic targets for populations underserved by current therapies. Using a mouse model we provide evidence that severe asthma is associated with increased IL-17A production, and is compounded by enhanced Il17ra expression and elevated responsiveness to IL-17A. These alterations in IL-17A production and responsiveness exacerbate IL-13-driven STAT6 activation, gene expression, and airway responses. Our preliminary data suggests that IL-17A-mediated enhancement of IL-13-driven responses occur through two, non-mutually independent mechanisms in mouse cells; 1) by causing the dissociation of a complex including IL-13R¿1 and TRAF3, which normally limits IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation, and 2) by activating transcription factors (NF-¿B, C/EBP¿ and C/EBP¿) which can enhance IL-13/STAT6 driven gene expression. While preliminary studies presented here also suggest that similar mechanisms may operate in human cell lines, the extent to which the observations made in our mouse model apply to humans with severe asthma is unclear. Three specific aims are proposed to identify the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A enhances asthma severity in mice, and humans. Specific Aim 1 will determine if the increased IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation and AHR observed in the presence of IL-17A is the result of the dissociation of the IL- 13R¿1:TRAF3 complex following initiation of IL-17A signaling. Specific Aim 2 will dissect the importance of IL- 17A-driven activation of NF-¿B (canonical versus non-canonical), C/EBP¿ and C/EBP¿ in IL-13/IL-17A synergy in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will directly test whether similar synergistic interactions between IL-13 and IL-17A are observed in asthma relevant, primary human cells. Additionally, we will determine whether severe asthma in children is associated, as it is in the mouse, with increased IL-17A production, IL17RA expression, and IL-17A responsiveness. Collectively, the studies proposed in this application will move us beyond the ""Th2 paradigm"" of allergic asthma, begin to characterize the mechanisms whereby Th17-products trigger the development of severe allergic asthma, and determine whether similar mechanisms may be at play in mice and humans. A better understanding of these mechanisms will enable us to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions in individuals with severe asthma, a population underserved by current therapies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Elevated IL-17A levels have been linked to the development of severe asthma in humans, a debilitating, treatment-resistant form of allergic asthma that accounts for the majority of asthma-related mortality and morbidity. However, the mechanisms through which IL-17A exacerbates disease severity remain unclear, representing an important knowledge gap that is preventing the development of novel treatments that directly address the unique disease processes driving pathogenesis in severe asthma. The long term goal of the current project is the design of novel therapeutics that specifically disease in severe asthmatics, a population underserved by current treatments.            ",Mechanisms of IL-17A-mediated enhancement of asthma severity,8670181,R01HL122300,"['Accounting ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Allergens ', ' Animals ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cells ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"A Pilot Stress Management Intervention for High Risk Children with Asthma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children in the United States, with disproportionately high morbidity and mortality among minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged children living in urban areas. These disparities are not fully accounted for by differences in asthma prevalence, highlighting a need for interventions targeting factors associated with poorer asthma control. Converging evidence suggests that psychosocial factors that accompany socioeconomic disadvantage contribute to the marked disparities in childhood asthma morbidity, with psychological stress predicting future asthma exacerbations in children. Chronic stress and lower socioeconomic status also are associated with the exacerbation of airway inflammatory responses to environmental triggers and the upregulation of inflammatory processes directly implicated in asthma exacerbation. Evidence that stress accentuates airway inflammation and predicts asthma morbidity raises the possibility that psychological interventions aimed at helping children manage stress could improve the physical health of high risk children with asthma. To date, studies of psychosocial interventions for pediatric asthma have been of poor general quality, highlighting a need for further more rigorous research. Accordingly, we have developed a stress management and coping skills training program based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (""I Can Cope""). Preliminary trials provide initia support for the feasibility of offering this supplemental intervention to 8-12 year old asthmatics n urban schools and provide initial evidence for intervention-related decreases in perceived stress and improvements in lung function, as measured by spirometry. The primary objective of the proposed research is to conduct a critical randomized controlled pilot evaluation of the effectiveness of this school-based intervention to obtain data that is necessary to develop a full-scale clinical trial. For this purpose, we propose randomly assigning 108 economically disadvantaged urban 3rd through 6th graders with physician-confirmed asthma to the school-based intervention or an education only control condition. Primary outcomes will include (1) psychological function and (2) asthma health, as assessed at the end of the intervention period. If future work confirms our initial feasibility findings, this will be the first study to demonstrae the health benefit of a school-based asthma stress management intervention for high risk children living in urban settings, providing a novel means of intervening to reduce disparities in asthma morbidity. Furthermore, it will provide a more efficient and cost-effective means of accessing vulnerable children than individual clinic based intervention, which we have not found to be feasible.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:         Minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged children living in urban areas in the US are at disproportionately high risk for asthma morbidity, with disparities in asthma severity being larger than those in asthma prevalence. Growing evidence shows that psychosocial factors that accompany socioeconomic disadvantage may play a role in these disparities, with psychological stress predicting future asthma exacerbations in children. The current application proposes a pilot study examining the first school-based intervention to target this modifiable risk factor. Thus, the public health implications of the project are considerable and include the identification of a method of intervening to reduce disparities in asthma morbidity. In addition, we anticipate that the intervention will be cost effective, reducing medical visits, use of as needed medications, and school absenteeism.        (End of Abstract)            ",A Pilot Stress Management Intervention for High Risk Children with Asthma,8656756,R34HL107613,"['Absenteeism ', ' abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Spirometry ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Up-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' pulmonary function ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Exhalation ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' skills training ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' post intervention ', ' pilot trial ', ' Minority ', ' airway epithelium infalmmation ', ' airway inflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' Lung Inflammation ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' 12 year old ', ' modifiable risk ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' control trial ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R34,2014,208068,0.36932900441806354
"Psychosocial Factors and the Risk of Incident Asthma in African American Women  ABSTRACT Asthma has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and African-Americans fare worse than whites on all measures of asthma morbidity. Reasons for the disparity have not been satisfactorily explained. Psychosocial factors like experiences of violence and living in disadvantaged and/or inner city neighborhoods have been found to play a role in childhood asthma prevalence and severity. While the role of psychosocial factors in asthma expression has been studied in children there is little research on such factors in adults. Stress is the putative mechanism and there are plausible biological mechanisms by which it may contribute to the incidence of adult-onset asthma. Psychosocial factors may be of particular importance in asthma incidence in black women because the prevalence of experiences of violence, racism, depression, and living in disadvantaged neighborhoods are higher than in white women. If such experiences increase the risk of adult onset asthma, they may contribute to the racial disparity in asthma morbidity. The objective of this application is to fill this gap in knowledge about the role of psychosocial factors in incident adult-onset asthma in African American women. Our central hypothesis is that individual- and neighborhood-level psychosocial factors that may lead to stress increase the risk of adult-onset asthma in African-American women. The rationale for the proposed research is that the identification of factors that increase the risk of adult-onset asthma is a necessary step in the development of preventive policies and interventions to reduce both levels of adult-onset asthma and the gap in black/white asthma morbidity. The specific aims of this proposal are to 1) estimate the influence of experiences of racism, experiences of violence during childhood and adolescence, and depressive symptoms to asthma incidence and 2) to estimate the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), racial segregation, and urbanicity to asthma incidence. We will conduct prospective analyses using data from the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS). The BWHS cohort, assembled in 1995, includes approximately 59,000 African-American women from across the U.S. Detailed information on demographics, medical and reproductive history, and disease endpoints including asthma, was collected at baseline and in biennial follow- up questionnaires. On selected follow-up questionnaires, information was obtained on the psychosocial factors of interest. Participant addresses have been geocoded and linked with census data. Over 16 years of follow-up through 2011, approximately 1800 incident cases of asthma will have been reported. The study is innovative because it will be the first prospective study to consider the effects of the psychosocial exposures of interest on incident adult asthma in African American women. The proposed research is significant because positive results may direct intervention efforts to address stressors like racism and violence and may motivate further mechanistic studies of how chronic stress leads to asthma, which might inform the development of new therapeutic interventions.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will identify psychosocial factors that contribute to asthma incidence in African American women and thus will fill gaps in knowledge about risk factors for adult-onset asthma and about reasons for the racial disparity in asthma morbidity in the US. Results from the proposed study have the potential to inform preventive strategies at the individual and societal level. Thus the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that seeks to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",Psychosocial Factors and the Risk of Incident Asthma in African American Women,8587499,R01HL107314,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Play ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Societies ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' War ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' density ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' racism ', ' Reproductive Issues ', ' Reproductive History Epidemiology ', ' Reproductive Factors ', ' Reproductive History ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' Severities ', ' interest ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Reporting ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' missing work ', ' Employee Absenteeism ', ' Absenteeism at work ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Psychosocial Effect ', ' Treatment/Psychosocial Effects ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Adult asthma ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' ']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2014,305165,0.42153646497831654
"Coordinated Healthcare Interventions for Childhood Asthma Gaps in Outcomes (CHICAGO) Collaboration II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coordinated Healthcare Interventions for Childhood Asthma Gaps in Outcomes (CHICAGO)  Collaboration II (CHICAGO Collaboration II) Chicago is an epicenter for asthma health disparities, with African-American children bearing a disproportionate share of the burden. Many evidence-based care strategies have demonstrated the ability to improve asthma control, but uncertainty remains about how best to implement and sustain these strategies in settings where children live, learn, play, and receive medical care. Over the past two decades, local partnerships have developed between caregivers, asthma advocacy groups, health systems, clinicians, community leaders, schools, local and state public health officials, healthcare technology innovators to address the problem of uncontrolled asthma among children in Chicago. The proposed CHICAGO Collaboration II builds on these partnerships to integrate evidence-based interventions that include technology and workforce solutions. We will combine inhaler sensors, mobile apps, and predictive analytics to provide personalized feedback for children, caregivers, school staff, and clinicians. The technology solutions will support trained community health workers (CHWs) for children and caregivers in the emergency room, federally qualified health centers, homes, and schools. The asthma CHWs will also help children and caregivers to identify and eliminate environmental triggers for asthma in the home. These interventions are integrated into a four-sector Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP) for children in West and South side regions of Chicago. The CHICAGO Collaboration II has four specific aims to achieve during the U34 planning year. Aim 1 is to engage a diverse group of stakeholders to align study activities with the needs of communities disproportionately affected by asthma. Aim 2 is to conduct a community-based needs assessment (CNA) to identify resources, gaps in resources, and specific barriers to implementing evidence- based care in the sectors targeted by the ACIP. Aim 3 applies data from the CNA to update and finalize the CHICAGO II ACIP. Aim 4 is to use the revised ACIP and CNA information to update and finalize the design of a clinical trial to evaluate the four-sector CHICAGO II ACIP. The CHICAGO Collaboration II represents a unique, broad-based consortium that has the expertise, experience, and community partnerships to develop, test, and implement a sustainable model of care that successfully reduces asthma disparities in high-risk minority children in Chicago. Our collaborative approach to asthma in Chicago represents the culmination of over two decades of preparation, ensuring the successful completion of the activities proposed in this U34 application. By the end of the U34 project period, the CHICAGO Collaboration II team will be prepared to apply for the companion U01 application (HL-17-001) to support the clinical trial, assess sustainability, and define the best practices for implementation.

"A Community-Engaged Approach to Reducing Pediatric Asthma Disparities in Richmond ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this U34 application, submitted in response to RFA-HL-15-028: Creating Asthma Empowerment Collaborations to Reduce Childhood Asthma Disparities, is to conduct a community-based needs assessment to inform the development of a randomized clinical trial to decrease asthma morbidity and healthcare utilization among urban children with asthma (5-17 years) in Richmond City. Richmond, an urban center, has been named by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation as the Asthma Capital (i.e., most challenging place to live in the United States with asthma) three times in the last fou years. We will partner with Engaging Richmond, an existing community-university partnership at VCU (NCATS UL1TR000058) in conducting our needs assessment and developing an Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP) for children. We will use a model of community engagement from the beginning of our planning year that involves community residents in every step of our needs assessment from recruitment to dissemination. The community needs assessment will include six elements: caregiver and youth advisory groups; monthly meetings with stakeholders; caregiver and child focus groups; community survey of caregivers of children with asthma; model synthesis; interviews with key informants. Goals of our formative mixed-methods needs assessment include: 1) identifying factors that promote or inhibit effective asthma management in urban families, 2) identifying specific community concerns related to the treatment of children with asthma, 3) engaging community stakeholders in identifying and prioritizing the needs of families of children with asthma, and 4) using feedback from our needs assessment to modify the proposed ACIP and develop a protocol to assess the ACIP. Stakeholders and key informants include representatives from the Richmond City Health District, an area asthma coalition, policy makers, individuals in community-based organizations, caregivers of children with asthma, children with asthma, and asthma clinicians at area hospitals. Our proposed ACIP includes 3 evidence-based intervention components: 1) a community-based initiative that reduces home environmental exposures, 2) asthma self-management education delivered by community health workers, and 3) coordination with the child's asthma care provider to ensure appropriate evidence-based medical treatment. The integration of our ACIP is novel in that a case management committee (e.g., community health worker, pediatric nurse, psychologist) will ask caregivers directly about challenges they face in managing their child's asthma; these challenges may be embedded within the family's culture or within the family's community. We will use the results of our needs assessment to ensure that our interventions meet the needs of families in Richmond and address the highest priority items related to childhood asthma for these families. Through the innovative use of Engaging Richmond, we will be better able to consider the cultural context in which families live and the resources families in Richmond would need to succeed in the ACIP.     (End of Abstract)         Project Narrative.

"Boston High-risk Asthma Program Pathway in Youth- BHAPPY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): Black, Latino and low-income youth suffer a disproportionate burden of asthma in the United States. In Boston, this asthma inequitable burden is particular striking in children ages 0--led by the Boston University School of Medicine and the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC - the city's health department), the proposed Boston High-risk Asthma Program Pathway in Youth (BHAPPY) study leverages an existing public health/healthcare partnership to address asthma disparities among minority children 0-5 years of age receiving asthma care at primary care clinics serving predominantly low income Black and Latino families in Boston. This work will yield a replicable asthma pathway model for high-risk populations through the integration of evidence based interventions in four arenas: (1) facilitation of guideline-adherent care for pediatric asthma by medical providers; (2) enhanced telephone and technology-based communication with families (3) home-based asthma education/environmental control visits by community health workers (CHW's) and (4) supporting early education/childcare providers in trigger reduction and asthma action plan adherence. Integration across these elements will be facilitated by an Asthma Pathway Navigator. Specific Aims include: Aim 1: Engage community stakeholders (health care providers, parents of asthmatic children, school/childcare providers, insurers, other community partners) in the design of protocols for each component of the asthma pathway.

"AsthmaNet:  Phenotypic Influences on Asthma Treatments DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Pittsburgh AsthmaNet proposal includes 3 protocols, with a 4th mechanistic protocol built around unmet asthma needs and phenotyping. These protocols should contribute to understanding asthma phenotypes in relation to mechanisms and specific treatment, particularly in relation to health disparities and contributions from race, socioeconomic status (SES) and asthma severity. These protocols build on our inherent expertise in asthma phenotyping and biology, racial/ethnic/socioeconomic issues, environmental effects, particularly in relation to underserved populations, psychosocial stress, and severe asthma. Our proposal includes participation from the Center for Minority Health with expertise in outreach in minority populations, a partner at Rainbow Babies of Case Western Reserve and a satellite at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. The 1st clinical trial will compare two approved drugs for treatment of the adult onset asthma phenotype, which hypothesizes that a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor will be more effective than a leukotriene receptor antagonist. The 2nd study evaluates the role of race in relation to SES on corticosteroid (CS) responses in children, h3TJ0thesizing that the African-American asthma phenotype, with and without regard to SES, predicts a poor response to inhaled CSs in asthmatic children. Vitamin D supplementation will overcome the poor response and improve outcomes. We will recruit African American and Caucasian children stratified by race and SES. Children who remain symptomatic following initial stabilization will be treated with high dose ICS and response determined. Children of all groups who do not improve will be randomized to treatment with Vitamin D or higher ICS dose to determine whether Vitamin D + lower dose ICS improves exacerbations and CS responsiveness better or to the same degree than the higher dose ICS. The mechanistic ancillary protocol will address whether aspects of CS unresponsiveness can be modeled in vitro, including effects of race/SES factors on cytokine suppression and histones, and the effect of Vitamin D to improve them. Finally, the severe asthma protocol will focus on the mast cell, specifically prostaglandin D2 and its interaction with CRTH2. We believe these studies address unmet needs in asthma and will improve its therapy.

"Multi-Level Understanding of Social Contributors to SES Disparities in Asthma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in health outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES) are one of the most pressing public health problems our society faces today. In line with PAR-10-136's interest in multi-level approaches to understanding health disparities, we focus on childhood asthma and investigate factors simultaneously across neighborhood, family, and individual levels; we consider both physical environment and social environment exposures together; and we examine various levels of biological processes (organ systems, cellular, genomic) that drive asthma pathophysiology, all within a single project that seeks to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the causes of asthma disparities. The first aim is to understand how neighborhood, family, and individual-level social factors both shape and are shaped by one another, and how they collectively affect asthma disparities. The second aim is to measure social and physical exposures concurrently in order to explain how they interact to affect asthma disparities. The third aim is to create biologically plausible models for how social contexts contribute to health disparities by characterizing pathways at multiple levels biologicall (organ systems, cellular, genomic) that can explain how social contexts come to affect asthma disparities. This study will recruit a sample of 300 families from varying SES backgrounds who have a child ages 10-18 with persistent asthma. Families will participate in laboratory assessments of individual- and family-level social processes as well as child biological measures. Information on neighborhood characteristics will be linked from geographic information system maps of pollution exposures and maps of the social characteristics of communities created by a research consortium locally. In order to establish the temporal precedence of each of the 'levels' of factors, clinical outcomes will be tracked across a 1 year follow up period via monthly monitoring of symptoms as well as from hospitalization data obtained from provincial health records. Creating models that explain how neighborhood, family, and individual factors simultaneously contribute to asthma disparities is critical for developing a more holistic picture of how social contexts affect disease progression. These models will in turn shape our approaches to interventions. For example, interventions to improve medication adherence may not be effective if they do not acknowledge the broader social factors (e.g., neighborhood and family stress) that affect families' abilities to keep up with medication regimens. Assessing interactive effects between factors will also allow us to identify specific conditions under which potential targets of intervention would make the biggest differences in mitigating the pathophysiological processes underlying asthma. The overall goal of this project is to develop a more sophisticated understanding of why asthma disparities by SES exist and to identify the constellation of factors that would need to be targeted simultaneously in order to effectively alleviate these disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive, multi-level models that convincingly explain the multitude of ways in which low socioeconomic status (SES) is able to have pervasive effects on health are important for developing interventions that can maximally reduce health disparities. The proposed project will investigate social and physical environment factors across neighborhood, family, and individual levels in an effort to understand disparities by SES in childhood asthma. The overarching goal is to develop more sophisticated models of how social and physical environments affect and interact with one another to contribute to disease progression differentially in low SES children.",Multi-Level Understanding of Social Contributors to SES Disparities in Asthma,8868162,R01HL108723,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Allergens ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Authoritarianism ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Shapes ', ' Pollution ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Exhalation ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' health record ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' airway epithelium infalmmation ', ' airway inflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,407439,0.30235554550389326
"Enhancing Care, Coordination and Capacity Across Community Sectors to Improve Asthma Outcomes in High-Risk Children in Hawaii: Planning Phase ﻿    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): In economically challenged, rural, minority communities uncontrolled asthma exacts a huge toll on children, their families and the healthcare system in cost, school absenteeism, poor academic outcomes and, for parents, lost days at work. Asthma is a complex health condition, with numerous risk factors, that require solutions involving optimal healthcare and public health approaches to include family, environment and community needs. Federally qualified community health centers (FQHC) are well positioned to play a significant role in reducing asthma health disparities by coordinating clinical and public health approaches. Our goal is to reduce childhood asthma disparities in low-income, minority communities. We will develop a clinical trial to evaluate an Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP), coordinated at a large FQHC, in partnership with families, community partners and an at-risk public school district. The majority of students in this district are Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islanders and, overall, about 25% have asthma. The study will build on strong relationships formed between a FQHC, a public school district, the community, and the University established by the Principal Investigator, who is a community-based researcher and a long-time clinic pediatrician as well as an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Hawaii.  To best implement this multi-faceted study, we will conduct a needs assessment, using focus groups and key informant interviews, to ascertain the needs and barriers related to asthma care and distill possible community-based solutions. Strategies may include expanding school-based asthma care through the administration of asthma control medications, the delivery of asthma trigger control interventions to families at the school, and placing a FQHC nurse at schools to enhance communication and coordination of asthma care. Input from community thought leaders, families, schools personnel, public health nurses, and community pediatric healthcare providers will be sought. We will also examine current processes at the FQHC and at schools used to deliver asthma care, including electronic medical record systems, patient education materials and school based asthma action plans. Data will be used to refine the proposed ACIP. The specific aims of this one-year needs assessment and planning phase are as follows: 1. To identify healthcare and community health resources, needs and barriers related the optimal  management of persistent childhood asthma, including needs at school and home. 2. To identify the most feasible, acceptable and sustainable methods and strategies, in healthcare, school,  family and home, to address those needs and barriers.

"A community toolkit to improve asthma care for rural children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Provided By Applicant): Abstract More than four million people with asthma live outside of urban areas. Most of these patients are seen in primary care settings where their asthma is often inadequately managed, representing a significant gap in care. Health disparities for rural children with asthma include poverty, limited access to specialty care, and environmental challenges including high levels of outdoor and indoor air pollution exposure. We propose to develop a comprehensive Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP) to improve care for rural children with asthma. This project will bring together investigators from the University of Arizona and National Jewish Health to 1) engage four communities in rural southwestern Colorado and northern Arizona to build a successful collaboration; and 2) conduct a randomized pragmatic trial of a community rural pediatric asthma program. In the first (U34) phase, we will build on initial community outreach efforts conducted in 2014 with over 50 healthcare providers and critical access hospitals in the 25,000 mile Four Corners region (including the Southern Ute, Ute Mountain Ute, and Navajo Nation Reservations). During the initial engagement phase, we will solidify relationships and assess community needs with stakeholders including parents, community leaders, hospital administrators, schools, and providers. In the second (U01) phase, we will employ a stepped wedge, randomized trial design to test the capacity of the ACIP to improve asthma care and outcomes with four integrated interventions: 1) the medical care component will include comprehensive training of PCPs and hospital staff in evidence-based pediatric asthma management; 2) the home component will address community concerns about air quality and determine potential methods to measure and reduce environmental risks to children with asthma; 3) the community component will include a school-based program to identify undiagnosed asthma, provide education, and facilitate communication between school, family, and provider; and 4) the family component will connect families with all of the above including care coordination, education, and other forms of assistance such as transportation or low-cost medication. The final trial will be modified in accord with stakeholder input during the engagement phase and evaluated within the RE-AIM framework. We believe that the intervention could serve as a model for implementation of strategies to improve asthma care among children in rural settings, including those living on Native American reservations.

"Working together to improve asthma outcomes in West Philadelphia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Provided By Applicant): Asthma, the most common chronic disease in children, places a tremendous burden on affected children and their families especially in poor, minority communities. Despite medical advancement, disparities persists in these communities where affected children experience higher rates of asthma inpatient and emergency visits as well as deaths.1 Previous studies have documented contributing factors which include poor housing stock, stress, neighborhood violence, and geographical isolation.5-6 Persistent challenges include linking patients to their medical home and reducing barriers such as access to transportation, housing issues and food insecurity. Asthma evidence-based interventions have been shown to improve outcomes for this population but are often implemented as individual interventions rather than in an integrated, comprehensive approach which would support and promote sustainability. Our specific aims are:1) Through a community needs assessment utilizing triangulated data gathered from secondary data sources, focus groups and key informant interviews, develop a comprehensive understanding of the multitude of factors that influence childhood asthma among children living in the West Philadelphia target community. 2) On the basis of the needs assessment, continue to engage stakeholders in the community, home health care and school sectors in planning the implementation, integration, and assessment of evidence-based interventions toward the goal of creating an ACIP plan that is comprehensive, culturally relevant, responsive to identified needs, and feasible. Stakeholders will meet monthly as a group with the core investigators and additionally with the research team as needed. 3) Employing a pragmatic control design, we will develop a sustainable asthma care implementation program, (ACIP), targeting children ages 6-12 years in West Philadelphia, for the U01 application. The ACIP will integrate evidence-based interventions in the home (NationalCICAS or CAPP Home Visit Program), school (NAEPP Asthma School basics, student peer education, tools for schools, or intensive case management), medical home (Yes We Can or Easy Breathing) and community (CAPP Classes and/or support groups).

"Asthma Care Implementation Program for the District of Columbia (ACIP-DC) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Provided By Applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and despite evidence-based guidelines from the National Institutes of Health, overall morbidity from the disease has decreased only modestly. In addition, striking and unacceptable disparities in care and outcomes persist that disproportionately affect poor, urban, and minority children and adolescents. Addressing these disparities is a central priority for multiple federal agencies, local communities, parents and patients, and investigators. There are notable examples of evidence- based interventions that do reduce pediatric asthma morbidity and disparities. The validated IMPACT DC intervention, for example, has improved multiple measures of pediatric asthma care and outcomes in Washington, DC. Nevertheless, pediatric asthma morbidity in DC remains high, and further improving pediatric asthma care and outcomes in DC and elsewhere will require moving beyond the largely medical model of interventions and incorporating additional evidence-based interventions from the domains of medical care, family, home, and community. The overall goal of our proposed project is therefore to use a community driven process to integrate such interventions into a highly patient and family-centered program ready for rigorous subsequent validation as a reproducible means to improve asthma outcomes among vulnerable urban youth. The Asthma Care Implementation Program for the District of Columbia (ACIP-DC) will incorporate the existing IMPACT DC intervention, but will expand it by adding a Community Asthma Navigator (based on a Community Health Worker model) to coordinate multiple other ongoing patient services and by using an electronic care coordination platform to integrate those services. The ACIP-DC proposal is highly significant in that it will create a new and highly collaborative program ready for rigorous evaluation in a randomized trial. If efficacious in Washington DC, the program will then be ready for dissemination elsewhere as a means to address disparities in similar communities burdened with high pediatric asthma morbidity. In order to achieve our overall goal, we will pursue three specific aims: (1) we will partner with our Child Health Advocacy Institute to conduct a community needs assessment focused on understanding the existing network of care for DC's children at high risk of poor asthma outcomes through an iterative process of engaging a diverse group of local stakeholders; (2) informed by this needs assessment, we will create, pilot test, and modify ACIP-DC by integrating evidence-based interventions from the domains of medical care, family, home, and community; and (3) we will plan and pilot the elements of a rigorous protocol for the evaluation of ACIP-DC in a prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial that compares it to the IMPACT DC intervention alone (usual care). In pursuing this goal, the experienced research team will leverage its existing network of local collaborators, and will engage new ones as well. Key elements of ACIP-DC will be pilot tested, and the entire intervention will be scripted with a high fidelity checklist ready to serve as the basis for a clincal trial.     (End of Abstract)         Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, with striking disparities in care and outcomes that disproportionately affect at-risk urban youth. Existing interventions have had limited success in reducing overall morbidity. We will build upon our IMPACT DC model by pursuing a community driven process to integrate other evidence-based interventions into it, yielding a highly patient and family-centered program (Asthma Care Implementation Program for the District of Columbia), in which care will be coordinated by a Community Asthma Navigator.",Asthma Care Implementation Program for the District of Columbia (ACIP-DC),9018607,U34HL130746,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Effects of Cumulative Risk on Asthma Outcomes in Urban Children and Adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric asthma disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minority children and children living in low-income, urban areas. In addition to increased asthma morbidity and healthcare use, children from urban areas are at risk for additional stressors (e.g., poverty, neighborhood stress) that can contribute to poor asthma outcomes. The continual activation of the stress response without adequate buffering (i.e., toxic stress) has been associated with the development of illnesses, including asthma. However, limited research has examined the processes related to toxic stress that may increase asthma morbidity in urban children who already carry an asthma diagnosis. The proposed study will use innovative technology (ecological momentary assessment [EMA] delivered via smartphone) to assess processes that place urban children at increased risk for poor asthma outcomes. Specifically, this study will investigate the association between a cumulative risk model of stress and child asthma outcomes (ages 7-12) in a low-income, urban sample of 60 families (87% African American), as well as the potential for caregiver support related to asthma care to serve as a protective factor in this association. Data collected from urban families with a child with persistent asthma as part of the CARE Study (Childhood Asthma in Richmond Families; Targeted Research Grant, Society of Pediatric Psychology; R. Everhart, PI) will be analyzed. This study will also examine whether a cumulative risk model is a stronger predictor of asthma outcomes in urban children than any one risk factor. Additionally, the proposed study will assess the ecological validity of two widely used stress measures. Given developmental differences between younger children and adolescents, the proposed study will also develop a new adolescent-specific cumulative risk model of stress and test its association with asthma outcomes in adolescents from urban settings. Original data will be collected from a sample of 60 urban adolescents with asthma (13-17 years) and their caregivers. Families will complete an initial research session and then adolescents will use a handheld spirometer for 14 days. Specifically the proposed study hypothesizes that: 1) more cumulative risk will be associated with poorer asthma outcomes in both groups (i.e., younger children and adolescents); 2) higher levels of caregiver support for the child's asthma care will minimize the effects of cumulative ris on child and adolescent asthma outcomes; 3) the cumulative risk model will be a stronger predictor of asthma outcomes than any one factor; 4) the adolescent-specific cumulative risk model will account for more variance in adolescent asthma outcomes than the model generated for the younger age group, and 5) higher scores on the baseline stress scales will be related to more stressors reported on the EMA daily surveys. Results will inform future research aimed at improving asthma outcomes among low-income, urban children and adolescents by better understanding the association between stress and asthma outcomes in a group most at risk for experiencing high rates of asthma morbidity and healthcare utilization.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will examine the effects of a cumulative risk model of stress on asthma outcomes in urban children and adolescents with asthma. Taking into account a toxic stress framework, the proposed study will test whether caregiver support for the child's asthma care buffers the relationship between cumulative risk and asthma outcomes. This study will inform prevention and treatment efforts for urban children and adolescents with asthma.            ",Effects of Cumulative Risk on Asthma Outcomes in Urban Children and Adolescents,8982928,F31HL129681,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Buffers ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' child developmental psychology ', ' Pediatric Psychology ', ' Child Psychology ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Child Support ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' innovative technologies ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' NRSA ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Stress Tests ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' 12 year old ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 year old ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ']",NHLBI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,41790,0.3899229945201174
"Healthy Learning, Healthy Living Healthy Lives     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to white Americans, African Americans live sicker and die younger. Although the magnitudes of racial socioeconomic status (SES) disparities in morbidity and mortality are often largest among adults, they often begin in childhood. In fact, past research reveals that, ""[racial disparities in U.S. child disease prevalene rates have been observed for obesity, asthma, diabetes, preterm birth, infant death, mental health, birth defects, physical abuse, injury, low birth weight, all-cause mortality, and disabilit."" Accordingly, efforts to eliminate race and SES disparities in health among adults should begin with efforts to prevent and intervene in health disparities among children. America's most prevalent chronic pediatric health condition is asthma. Asthma is also a significant source of race and SES disparities in health, and a correlate, cause and/or consequence of disparities in children's psychosocial stress exposures, academic outcomes, physical living conditions, and other structural, environmental and social factors. The proposed Healthy Living, Healthy Learning, Healthy Lives (HL3) Project equitably engages community and academic partners in an effort to investigate, ameliorate and ultimately eliminate, disparities in children's health, wih a particular focus on asthma, its correlates, consequences and co-morbidities. The Specific Aims of the project are as follows: 1) to strengthen and expand the health focus of an existing community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership. 2) To use the HL3 CBPR partnership to plan and implement a multi-level (individual, family, school, neighborhood, policy) community assessment. 3) To use the results of the community assessment (Aim 2) to plan a multi-level pilot CBPR intervention. 4) To use the intervention plan (Aim 3) to implement a multi-level pilot CBPR intervention study. 5) To evaluate the process and outcomes of the HL3 Project's three-year intervention planning process.         RELEVANCE: To strengthen and expand an existing community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership, and to use this partnership to refine the social determinants of health conceptual framework and design, implement and evaluate a multi-level (individual, family, school, neighborhood, policy) community assessment and intervention plan with an initial focus on asthma, its correlates, consequences and co-morbidities.

"School-Based Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management (SB-TEAM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a first competing renewal of a school-based program designed to reduce morbidity for poor children with asthma by facilitating delivery of guideline-based care and improving adherence to effective preventive asthma medications. In 2006, we implemented the School Based Asthma Therapy (SBAT) trial (R01HL079954) with 530 children from more than 50 urban schools. The primary intervention for the SBAT trial consisted of directly observed administration of preventive asthma medications in school (with dose adjustments according to NHLBI guidelines). Results from this study demonstrate reduced morbidity, decreased absenteeism, and fewer exacerbations for these very high-risk children. This program has the potential to serve as a model for improved asthma care in urban communities, however several factors limit dissemination of the program in its current form. For example, extensive resources were required for screening and implementation of the program, and communications with providers for ongoing monitoring of symptoms were inefficient, often delaying recommended medication adjustments. In order for this program to have sustainable public health impact, we must now test a system that allows for full integration within the school and community systems that serve these children. In this new application we propose the next phase in our research, which represents a critical step in our expanding partnership with the city school district. We propose testing a novel school-based program (SB-TEAM - School-Based Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management), which directly builds on our prior work, for children with persistent asthma in Rochester City Elementary Schools.  We recently developed and pilot-tested the technology for web-based screening and communication for this intervention (RC1HL099432), and now propose a full-scale trial across an entire school district using this technology with the addition of telemedicin asthma assessments to assure appropriate follow-up care and optimal treatment. We hypothesize that children receiving care through SB-TEAM will experience less asthma- related morbidity compared to children in an enhanced usual care (eUC) comparison group. Further, we anticipate that the benefits will be even greater than those seen in the original SBAT trial, due t the ability to more optimally tailor each child's medication regimen. The SB-TEAM program includes systematic web-based asthma screening, directly observed administration of preventive asthma medications in school, and ongoing monitoring and tailoring of the care regimen using school-based telemedicine. Children in the eUC group will receive asthma screening with notification of their PCP, as well as systematic feedback to the parent and provider to promote appropriate guideline based follow-up care. This application represents a logical extension of our work to improve adherence to effective asthma medications that can reduce health disparities and could ultimately be sustained in communities nationwide.          Urban children with asthma suffer from substantial morbidity and suboptimal preventive care. This project may have a profound impact on public health because it proposes an expansion of an innovative school- based intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines that is specifically designed to promote optimal care within an existing infrastructure. Should it prove successful in reducing symptoms and improving the health of urban children with asthma, it has the potential to serve as a sustainable model for improved asthma care for this population.

"School-Based Asthma Care for Teens (SB-ACT) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood, and despite current advances in therapies, morbidity and mortality continue to increase. Low-income, minority teenagers have disproportionately high rates of asthma morbidity, including excess risk of emergency department care, hospitalization, and death from asthma, compared to white adolescents. Although urban children suffer the largest burden from asthma, they are the least likely group to receive adequate preventive care, and poor adherence plays a significant contributing role in asthma morbidity. Inner city adolescents with asthma are at particular risk of nonadherence.  Thus, there is a substantial amount of suffering that could be prevented with improvements in care. This application builds on our extensive experience with efficacious school-based programs for urban children and teens with asthma. The overall goal is to broadly disseminate a novel system of asthma care throughout the entire city school district ('School Based Asthma Care for Teens'; SBACT), and test its effectiveness in improving adherence and reducing morbidity among urban teens.  The SB-ACT intervention includes two core components. First, adolescents visit the school nurse daily for 6-8 weeks at the start of the school year to receive a trial of directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medications. The goal is for the teen to establish a relationship with the nurse, learn proper medication technique, and experience the benefits and value of daily preventive therapy. Four to 6 weeks after the initiation of DOT, the teen will receive a motivational interviewing (MI) counseling program designed to  enhance the teen's motivation to transition to independent, sustained preventive medication use. We will train community-based nurses affiliated with the local American Lung Association to deliver the MI component. The MI nurse will conduct three counseling sessions with the teen at school, which are designed to capitalize on the teen's experience with DOT and the potential benefits they experienced. Given the complex nature of  asthma care in this population, we plan to evaluate this intervention using a 3-group design in which 430 teens  will be randomly assigned to either; 1) the SB-ACT program (trial of DOT for 6-8 weeks + 3 MI counseling  sessions); 2) DOT-only (DOT only for 6-8 weeks); or 3) an asthma education (AE) comparison group (in-school  asthma education delivered by a trained asthma educator). We include the DOT-only group to evaluate whether this component alone is sufficient to promote sustained adherence without counseling. The AE group is designed to enhance asthma care and control for the attention received in MI counseling. We will assess the effectiveness of the SB-ACT intervention in reducing asthma morbidity, perform an economic sustainability analysis, and evaluate each component of program implementation with a focus on sustainability and dissemination. At the completion of the study, the effectiveness of this system of school-based asthma care will be better defined as a sustainable means to improve care for adolescents and reduce health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urban adolescents with asthma suffer from substantial morbidity and suboptimal preventive care. This project may have a profound impact on public health because it proposes the implementation of an innovative, efficacious intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines throughout an entire urban school district.

"Mentoring and Patient Oriented Research in Asthma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Dr. Diette is Associate Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he has joint appointments in Epidemiology and Environmental Health Sciences at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Since joining the faculty, Dr. Diette has served as mentor to more than 20 trainees, including 14 postdoctoral fellows.  With rare exception, his mentees have gone on to highly productive academic careers, garnering honors and receiving NIH grant support (NRSA, K23, R21, R01 U01 and Project Leader on program grants). The majority of his professional life has been dedicated to the conduct of research, presentation and dissemination of findings and establishing a steady base of research funding from the NIH and other sources. The focus of Dr. Diette's career has been on patient-oriented research in asthma, especially race-based health care disparities and environmental determinants of the disease. The main purpose of this K24 proposal is to provide relief from clinical and administrative duties in order to expand the POR program and dedicate additional time and energy to current and future trainees. Thus, the overall aims of this proposal are: Aim 1: To enhance the candidate's capacity to mentor clinician scientists in patient-oriented research; and Aim 2: To expand the candidate's clinical research program in directions that create new scientific opportunities for him and his mentees.          Dr. Diette directs the ASTHMA-DIET, a program award examining how diet contributes to asthma susceptibility in children and co-directs the Hopkins DISCOVER program, which investigates mechanisms by which allergens and pollutants provoke inflammation and oxidative stress. These programs are the research homes for his current mentees. These multi-project programs bring together broad scientific expertise from allergists, pulmonologists, adult and pediatric medicine, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, environmental health engineers and others. While substantial evidence now exists for the role of the indoor environment in pediatric asthma, there is insufficient evidence of the biologic mechanisms by which allergens and pollutants may provoke inflammation and oxidative stress in inner city adults.  As adults with asthma endure the majority (90%) of mortality attributed to the disease, treatments are inadequate, especially in the area of environmental control.  A major focus of this proposal will be to expand the present research program from inner city children to also include inner city adults. The proposed cohort of 100 inner city adults with asthma will examine the extent to which indoor particulate matter provokes oxidative stress and inflammation.  With this expansion in the research program, the candidate will provide the foundation for future trials in adults of home-based multi- component environmental interventions, goals which are concordant with the career goals of current mentees and will establish the infrastructure for future mentees with a research interest in adult asthma.

"Vitamin D, Steroids, and Asthma in African American Youth  Abstract  Further studies are urgently needed in order to identify effective and sustainable strategies for reducing the dramatic health disparities experienced by disadvantaged, urban, and minority youth with asthma. Vitamin D deficiency is more common among African American (AA) individuals, especially those from urban environments or with obesity. We and others have contributed to increasing evidence that vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to more severe asthma through increased risk of respiratory infection and decreased glucocorticoid sensitivity. Indeed, low vitamin D levels were recently linked with the need for exogenous glucocorticoids and increased asthma severity. Particularly relevant to health disparities, we showed a strong association between vitamin D insufficiency and asthma in urban African American (AA) youth. Because AA youth residing in urban Washington, DC have markedly worse asthma than other racial/ethnic groups (e.g. prevalence rate 20% higher than the national rate 15 and emergency department utilization rates up to 5 times the national rates and nearly 10 times the Healthy People 2010 target rate), we will utilize our access to this population at the extreme of asthma disparities to examine the contribution of vitamin D to disparities in the chronic control and acute severity of asthma. The overall goal of this application is to provide critical epidemiological/molecular information that will inform the interpretation of ongoing and impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma. The knowledge generated by the experiments in this application will be crucial to translation of this inexpensive, easily-accessible potential therapy for asthma. We hypothesize that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels are associated with poor chronic asthma control, worse acute asthma severity, and glucocorticoid insensitivity. AIM 1. Define asthma phenotypic clusters and determine cross- sectional inter- and intra-cluster associations with serum 25(OH)D levels within and between AA and non-AA youth. AIM 2. Determine prospective associations among serum 25(OH)D levels and: (a) chronic asthma control and (b) acute asthma severity within and between AA and non-AA youth. AIM 3. Show the effect of vitamin D on glucorticoid regulation of inflammatory mediators in asthmatic airway epithelial cells.  Narrative  The overall goal of this application is to provide critical epidemiological/molecular information that will inform the interpretation of ongoing and impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma. The knowledge generated by the experiments in this application will be crucial to translation of this inexpensive, easily-accessible potential therapy for asthma.","Vitamin D, Steroids, and Asthma in African American Youth",8795111,R01MD007075,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Cells ', ' auricularum ', ' Visumetazone ', ' Spersadox ', ' Spersadex ', ' Predni-F ', ' Orgadrone ', ' Ocasa ', ' Mymethasone ', ' Millicorten ', ' Methylfluorprednisolone ', ' Loverine ', ' Lokalison-F ', ' Hexadrol ', ' Hexadecadrol ', ' Gammacorten ', ' Fortecortin ', ' Fluorodelta ', ' Dinormon ', ' Dexone ', ' Dexinoral ', ' Dexapos ', ' Dexamonozon ', ' Dexamethasonum ', ' Dexameth ', ' Dexamecortin ', ' Dexalocal ', ' Dexafluorene ', ' Dexafarma ', ' Dexacortin ', ' Dexacortal ', ' Dexace ', ' Dexa-sine ', ' Dexa-Scheroson ', ' Dexa-Rhinosan ', ' Dexa-Mamallet ', ' Dex-4 ', ' Desameton ', ' Desamethasone ', ' Deronil ', ' Deltafluorene ', ' Dekacort ', ' Deenar ', ' Dectancyl ', ' Decasone R.p.

"Mechanisms of IL-17A-mediated enhancement of asthma severity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lung that currently afflicts more than 300 million people worldwide. While asthma is mediated by an excessive Th2 immune response to allergens, recent evidence suggests that production of the Th17 cytokine, IL-17A, is associated with the development of more severe disease. While severe asthmatics are at greatest risk for morbidity or death following acute exacerbations, and can be refractory to therapies that are highly effective in individuals with mild disease, the molecular mechanisms whereby IL-17A contributes to the development of severe allergic asthma are ill-defined. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A facilitates severe asthma would provide additional therapeutic targets for populations underserved by current therapies. Using a mouse model we provide evidence that severe asthma is associated with increased IL-17A production, and is compounded by enhanced Il17ra expression and elevated responsiveness to IL-17A. These alterations in IL-17A production and responsiveness exacerbate IL-13-driven STAT6 activation, gene expression, and airway responses. Our preliminary data suggests that IL-17A-mediated enhancement of IL-13-driven responses occur through two, non-mutually independent mechanisms in mouse cells; 1) by causing the dissociation of a complex including IL-13R¿1 and TRAF3, which normally limits IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation, and 2) by activating transcription factors (NF-¿B, C/EBP¿ and C/EBP¿) which can enhance IL-13/STAT6 driven gene expression. While preliminary studies presented here also suggest that similar mechanisms may operate in human cell lines, the extent to which the observations made in our mouse model apply to humans with severe asthma is unclear. Three specific aims are proposed to identify the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A enhances asthma severity in mice, and humans. Specific Aim 1 will determine if the increased IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation and AHR observed in the presence of IL-17A is the result of the dissociation of the IL- 13R¿1:TRAF3 complex following initiation of IL-17A signaling. Specific Aim 2 will dissect the importance of IL- 17A-driven activation of NF-¿B (canonical versus non-canonical), C/EBP¿ and C/EBP¿ in IL-13/IL-17A synergy in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will directly test whether similar synergistic interactions between IL-13 and IL-17A are observed in asthma relevant, primary human cells. Additionally, we will determine whether severe asthma in children is associated, as it is in the mouse, with increased IL-17A production, IL17RA expression, and IL-17A responsiveness. Collectively, the studies proposed in this application will move us beyond the ""Th2 paradigm"" of allergic asthma, begin to characterize the mechanisms whereby Th17-products trigger the development of severe allergic asthma, and determine whether similar mechanisms may be at play in mice and humans. A better understanding of these mechanisms will enable us to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions in individuals with severe asthma, a population underserved by current therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Elevated IL-17A levels have been linked to the development of severe asthma in humans, a debilitating, treatment-resistant form of allergic asthma that accounts for the majority of asthma-related mortality and morbidity. However, the mechanisms through which IL-17A exacerbates disease severity remain unclear, representing an important knowledge gap that is preventing the development of novel treatments that directly address the unique disease processes driving pathogenesis in severe asthma. The long term goal of the current project is the design of novel therapeutics that specifically disease in severe asthmatics, a population underserved by current treatments.",Mechanisms of IL-17A-mediated enhancement of asthma severity,8842705,R01HL122300,"['Accounting ', ' Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Allergens ', ' Animals ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cells ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"A Self-Regulation Intervention for Older Adults with Asthma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma in older adults has been overlooked, understudied, and inadequately treated. While asthma programs targeting the unique needs of children, teenagers, women, minorities, and other populations have been successfully developed, there are currently none for older adults. This is particularly distressing as the asthma hospitalization rates, mortality rates, quality of life, and control are significantly worsein the elderly as compared to other age groups. It is clear that novel approaches are needed to improve the care in this population.  Our group has been active in the research of asthma in the elderly. We have analyzed national asthma data sets to look for disparities in older adults, have conducted qualitative research to determine factors associated with poor control in the elderly, and have performed a pilot study of a self- regulation intervention which was able to improve outcomes. We also have over 20 years of experience in asthma self-regulation interventions and physician communication enhancement for multiple populations of asthma patients. We will combine these strengths into our current protocol.  The intervention program will be based on the self-regulation theory of behavior, which will enhance the participants' ability to self-manage this chronic condition, actively involve the participant in their own health care management, and produce sustained results. In this application, we will evaluate a self-regulation asthma intervention in a diverse population of older adults. The intervention will be personalized to the challenges and goals each individual faces, which will enhance its applicability in different populations. This intervention will incorporate standard asthma education, complementary techniques for which older adults have expressed a strong interest, and enhanced communication with each participant's physician. Asthma specific outcomes will be assessed at one, six, and 12 months. The primary goal of this intervention is to decrease health care utilization (emergency department, urgent care, hospital, and unscheduled visits) for older adults with asthma. We will also assess the ability to improve quality of life, asthma symptoms, asthma control, lung function parameters, self-efficacy, and cost effectiveness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because adverse asthma outcomes disproportionally affect older adults, yet very little research has been directed towards this population.

"Gene-Environment Analyses of Early Life Exposures and Asthma in Ethnically Diverse Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a multifactorial disease with environmental and genetic contributions. We demonstrated that the harm caused by early-life exposures to air pollution and tobacco varies among different racial/ethnic groups. Our recent genome-wide association studies have identified both shared and ethnic-specific genetic risk factors for asthma and asthma-related traits. Our findings imply that both genes and early-life environmental exposures are important contributors to asthma susceptibility in minority children. We hypothesize that racial/ethnic differences in asthma susceptibility are due to gene-environment interactions resulting from early-life exposure to air pollution and tobacco. We will use existing genome-wide SNP genotypes and two distinct but complimentary approaches-admixture mapping and novel genome-wide GxE interaction scanning methods-to investigate the relationship between genetics, early-life air pollution and tobacco smoke exposures, and asthma risk. Specific Aim 1: Ancestry by environment interaction analysis of asthma in minority children. We will use genome-wide estimates of local chromosomal ancestry (African, European, and Native American) to perform an admixture mapping by environment (AxE) scan in 6,536 Latino and African American children from across the U.S. We will fine map AxE interaction peaks by performing targeted GxE analyses of genotyped and imputed SNPs from CAAPA and the Thousand Genomes Project. Results will be replicated using similar outcomes and exposures in the Mexico City Childhood Asthma Study (MCCAS). Specific Aim 2: Genome-wide by environment (GxE) interaction analysis of asthma in ethnically diverse children with and without asthma. We will use a novel two-step analytical method to perform a genome-wide scan at 38.9 million SNPs for GxE interactions with air pollution and tobacco smoke exposure. Scans will be performed in our combined resource of 8,138 children, as well as within Latino, European, and African American subgroups. Results will be replicated using similar outcomes and exposures in MCCAS. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We will identify genes and genetic loci whereby gene-environment interactions play an important role in asthma etiology, and thus retrieve part of the missing heritability of asthma. We will identify significant shared and ethnic specific gene-environment interactions, which will further our understanding of racial/ethnic differences in asthma susceptibility.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic and early-life environmental exposures are important contributors of asthma risk. Some racial/ethnic groups are more susceptible than others to developing asthma following early-life exposure to air pollution and tobacco smoke. Our goal is to untangle how the interplay between genetics and early-life exposures to air pollution and tobacco explain racial/ethnic differences in asthma risk among Latino and African American children.

"Reducing Asthma Morbidity in High Risk Minority Preschool Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite advances in asthma therapies and the wide-spread dissemination of asthma clinical guidelines, low-income, minority children have disproportionately high morbidity and mortality from asthma. The National Center for Children in Poverty has strongly argued that effective interventions to improve asthma health disparities and reduce harm must begin in early childhood. Previous efficacy studies have suggested that asthma education programs can be effective in improving overall management of asthma for preschool children. However, for these promising asthma intervention strategies to have sustainable public health impact for low-income, minority children they must be integrated within those medical, educational and social structures that serve these young high risk children, such as community clinics, schools and day care programs. Because one of the core missions of federally- funded Head Start programs is to provide preventive health services and screening to their low-income preschool students, Head Start represents an ideal community setting for disseminating early asthma education. We propose to draw on our established health and research partnership with Head Start programs in Baltimore City to test the effectiveness of this home-based asthma education intervention with demonstrated efficacy, when delivered in the context of a Head Start-wide asthma education program. We further propose to partner with Head Start to support and evaluate adoption, maintenance and dissemination of new knowledge gained from this project. Specifically we hypothesize that participants receiving the ABC intervention combined with a HS-level asthma education will have more symptom free days at the 6-, 9-, and 12-month evaluation when compared with participants in the HS- level asthma education alone. We plan to enroll of 406 children age 2-6 years old enrolled in Head Start with symptomatic asthma. Secondary outcome measures include other measures of asthma morbidity (i.e., hospitalizations, ED visits, oral steroid bursts, school absences, and caregiver quality of life). We will also evaluate the mediating effects of outcomes expectancies, self-efficacy, asthma knowledge, motivation, and asthma management practices, as well as moderator effects, such as health literacy, caregiver depression, neighborhood cohesion, family management of asthma, and Head Start adoption and dissemination of an asthma education curriculum.         Despite advances in asthma therapies and the wide-spread dissemination of asthma clinical guidelines, low-income, minority children have disproportionately high morbidity and mortality from asthma. The current study will test the effectiveness of this home-based asthma education intervention with demonstrated efficacy, when delivered in the context of a Head Start-wide asthma education program in improving asthma morbidity.

"The Asthma Action at Erie Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma Action at Erie Trial Asthma prevalence and morbidity has been increasing among children over the last three decades despite significant advances in environmental control and asthma care. The annual costs for children with asthma range between $2.0 and $3.2 billion. Asthma morbidity and its associated costs are not borne equally; they are highest for urban, low income, African American and Puerto Rican children. Community health workers (CHWs) have been growing in popularity as a potential intervention to combat these asthma disparities. CHWs are frontline public health workers who serve as liaisons between health and social services and communities to facilitate access to services and improve the quality and cultural competence of service delivery. The evidence on CHW asthma intervention efficacy has been growing but several critical gaps still exist. The Asthma Action at Erie Trial will test the ability of a CHW intervention with three important modifications to achiev asthma control in high-risk children: 1) CHWs will be integrated into both the clinical and the home setting, 2) A system for directly addressing mental health and psychosocial barriers will be provided, and 3) Participants will be provided only materials and equipment for trigger remediation that are supported by the current medical reimbursement system. A two-arm behavioral randomized controlled trial (N=220) will be conducted in partnership with a federally- qualified health center (FQHC) serving a low income, minority population that is at high-risk for significant asthma morbidity. The intervention arm will receive an integrated CHW home intervention for pediatric asthma education. The comparison arm will received clinic-based certified asthma educator (AE-C) services. Primary Aim 1 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention, relative to clinic-based AE-C education over 12-months, as demonstrated by asthma control. We hypothesize that the CHW arm will have at least 30% fewer days with activity limitation than the AE-C arm at 12-months. Specific Aim 2 is to assess maintenance of intervention efficacy, as demonstrated by asthma control at 18 and 24 months after randomization. Specific Aim 3 is to determine the cost-effectiveness at 12-months of CHW and AE-C intervention delivery, and additional costs or savings related to asthma exacerbations at 12- and 24-months. Specific Aim 4 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention relative to clinic- based AE-C education, as demonstrated by asthma control, among those experiencing depression, stress, and/or a post-traumatic stress disorder. This trial compares the current best practice in asthma self- management education (AE-C services) to an integrated CHW home intervention in which the real-life challenges of patients and the health care system are taken fully into account. This trial will provide clarity a to the expected effect size, cost savings, and resources needed to integrate asthma CHWs into clinical practice. .         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma Action at Erie Trial Support for community health worker (CHW) interventions is increasing rapidly despite an incomplete evidence base. This study uses a rigorous study design to determine the efficacy of a CHW home asthma intervention integrated into the clinic for high-risk children with asthma.

"Genetics of lung function and asthma severity in African Americans     DESCRIPTION: Severe, therapy-resistant asthma is a challenging disorder affecting ~10-15% of all asthmatics that is associated with persistent airway inflammation and progressive lung function deficits despite treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Although the mechanisms underlying severe asthma are poorly understood, racial disparities are evident among affected patients and suggest a potential role for genetics in the modulation of the disorder. In the U.S., African Americans are nearly twice as likely (compared to whites) to have current severe asthma independent of socioeconomic status, resulting in a two-fold increase in hospitalizations and a four-fold increase in asthma death. Furthermore, African Americans are twice as likely to have persistent airflow limitation and progressive loss of lung function despite equivalent treatment. However, African Americans have been poorly represented in asthma studies and thus there is an urgent need for research targeting African Americans to unravel the mechanisms and genetic underpinnings of severe asthma in this high-risk population. Although genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cross-sectional lung function measures in asthma patients, these studies were predominantly conducted in general populations of European whites and thus are of questionable relevance to African Americans. Furthermore, the clinical ""utility"" or ""meaningfulness"" of these SNPs in predicting other relevant asthma outcomes in this population remains unclear. Therefore, through a prospective, genotype- stratified cohort study, this application will determine whether SNPs in a panel of lung function genes predict asthma severity in African American children and adults with persistent asthma treated with ICS. The specific aims are to: 1) stratify and phenotype African American children and adults with persistent asthma by genotype 2) determine whether genotype predicts longitudinal asthma severity in African American children and adults with persistent asthma, and 3) refine the gene model for asthma severity in African American children and adults with ancestral genetic markers. Emory and Wake Forest have a long history of collaboration and together have led the initiative for phenotypic and genomic analyses of severe asthma. The findings generated here are expected to generate novel information on the contribution of genomic variants to severe asthma in African Americans. Given the increased morbidity associated with asthma in African Americans, these findings will lay important groundwork to advance personalized genomics approaches for this challenging and understudied population. This study is also in keeping with the mission of the NINR to improve quality of life by managing the symptoms of chronic illnesses (severe asthma) and to enhance research innovation through application of interdisciplinary approaches to improve the health of asthma patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of asthma is significantly greater in African Americans and is highlighted by increased asthma- related hospitalizations and deaths despite equivalent treatment. To understand whether genetic differences underlie racial disparities associated with asthma, we will conduct a prospective, genotype-stratified cohort study to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a panel of genes predicts asthma severity (lung function decline and exacerbations) in African American children and adults with persistent asthma treated with ICS. These findings will generate novel information on the contribution of genomic variants to severe asthma in African Americans and will lay important groundwork to advance personalized medicine for this challenging and understudied population.            ",Genetics of lung function and asthma severity in African Americans,8825360,R01NR013700,"['Therapeutic Corticosteroid ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' lumen dilator ', ' Bronchodilators ', ' Bronchial-Dilating Agents ', ' Bronchodilator Agents ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Pulmonology ', ' Pulmonary Medicine ', ' Pneumonology ', ' Pneumology ', ' Pulmonary Disease (Specialty) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' forest ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Notch-4/Int-3 Gene ', ' NOTCH4 ', ' Int3 Gene ', ' INT3 ', ' NOTCH4 gene ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Targeted Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' airway epithelium infalmmation ', ' airway inflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' gene panel ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized medicine ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,472606,0.4048564106472622
"The autophagic pathway and atopic asthma: role of IL-33 and ST2 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma represents a major public health burden characterized as an epidemic that disproportionately affects underrepresented minorities and children. The usual source of the lower airway inflammation characteristic of asthma is a Th2-mediated reaction initiated by common environmental allergens. Multiple independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on asthma have identified, as the most consistently associated genes with asthma among diverse ethnic/racial groups. However, the biological role and mechanism of IL-33/ST2 in modulating the innate-adaptive immunity interaction in asthma remains to be defined. Recent evidence suggests that IL-33-activated dendritic cells (DCs) are critical for Th2- mediated allergic airway inflammation. Moreover, autophagy is a core cellular process that contributes to cellular homeostasis with emerging links to the pathogenesis of asthma. Autophagy is involved in the delivery of potential cytoplasmic antigens to the endosome for degradation, processing, activation and presentation by DCs; and its activity is increased in asthmatic airways. We hypothesize that both the IL-33/ST2 and autophagic pathways play a crucial role in asthma and allergic diseases and IL-33/ST2 modulates the innate-adaptive immunity interaction via autophagy in Th2-mediated allergic airway inflammation. We have completed targeted resequencing of ST2 to identify rare variants as well as common variation that is not well ""tagged"" by the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the GWAS platforms in populations of African ancestry. We identified a novel and common haplotype that determines serum levels of soluble ST2 (sST2), which is comprised of three promoter variants that potentially alter transcription factor binding. In silico analyses of asthma GWAS databases identify 11 out of 84 selected key autophagic pathway genes for which variants are significantly associated with risk of asthma in African Americans, suggesting variation in this pathway may universally contribute to asthma risk. In the parent R01 grant to this new application, we have nearly completed whole-genome sequencing of >1,000 asthma cases and non-asthmatic controls comprising the 'Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas' (CAAPA). The resulting unique catalog of genetic variation in >1,000 individuals of African ancestry selected for asthma provides a unique opportunity to identify common and rare variants in the IL-33/ST2 and autophagic pathways. Specific aims of this application are:  (i) To identify rare and common variants in 84 autophagic pathway genes associated with asthma; and (ii) To test IL-33/ST2-mediated autophagic flux as a critical determinant of dendritic cell homeostasis and the mechanisms by which IL-33/ST2 regulates the innate-adaptive immunity interaction in asthmatic patients and non-asthmatic controls (N=20 each group). Results from these studies will provide insight into the pathogenesis, the genetic underpinnings and ethnic disparities of asthma as well as novel targets for therapy in the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Both the IL-33/ST2 and autophagic pathways play a crucial role in Th2-mediated responses in atopic asthma. We have identified polymorphisms in autophagic pathway genes associated with asthma and ST2 haplotype- specific regulation of serum levels of soluble ST2. We will test whether the autophagic pathway as a whole may control risk to asthma, and test whether IL-33/ST2 modulates the innate-adaptive immunity interaction via autophagy.",The autophagic pathway

The California Asthma Summit aligns with AHRQ's priority to fund dissemination and implementation conferences - conferences where research findings and evidence-based information and tools are summarized, communicated and used by organizations and individuals that have the capability to use the information to improve the outcomes, quality, access to, and cost and utilization of health care services. The 200 expected participants will include healthcare providers and representatives from healthcare plans, federal, state and local public health agencies, research institutions, community collaboratives, environmental health and advocacy. Sequoia Foundation will invite a diverse audience with special focus on underserved communities and those disproportionately burdened with asthma, including California's urban centers and rural agricultural communities. The two-day summit will feature six plenary and ten break-out sessions. Participants can either attend health care or community focused breakout sessions throughout the conference. Some sessions will be webcasted in an effort to reach at least another 100 people unable to travel. The California Asthma Summit will share new research by including topics like epigenetics and microbiome influences on asthma, explore topics that challenge current paradigms like the classification of asthma as one disease, and provide timely discussion of topics that will help participants understand the impacts public policies like the Affordable Care Act, clinical reimbursement programs, and climate change mitigation will have on asthma management. The Summit will also include topics that investigate social determinants of health like exposure to stress and trauma, neighborhood health and design, school environments, housing, and risk factors for asthma such as tobacco exposure and obesity. Sequoia Foundation and the California Department of Public Health have put together a strong team of partners to plan the Summit and have demonstrated success as trusted conveners and asthma experts in the state and nationally.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research conference will: 1) allow asthma researchers to share up-to-date information with stakeholders about asthma etiology, healthcare delivery, environmental and community interventions, and implications for public policy; 2) allow public health and healthcare providers to share best-practice programming and materials; 3) provide the opportunity for both groups to connect and learn from each other to plan and develop strategies to address the burden of asthma; and 4) promote implementation of strategies that reduce disparities in asthma outcomes that exist by race, geography, income and age.

"Statewide Implementation of the Head Start Controls Asthma in Preschoolers Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Provided By Applicant): Despite a strong evidence-base for the efficacy of asthma care intervention programs in reducing asthma morbidity among low-income minority children, little progress has been made in implementing and sustaining asthma care programs at the community and state level. In order to reduce asthma disparities it is critical to engage community stakeholders in implementing and sustaining systems of care that reach high-risk children.  Because one of the core missions of federally-funded Head Start programs is to provide preventive health services and screening to their low-income preschool students, Head Start represents an ideal community setting for establishing an Asthma Empowerment Zone. Our multi-disciplinary asthma health disparities collaborative group has a long and successful history of developing and evaluating multi-level community based interventions for asthma management in Head Start. We propose to draw on our established health and research partnership with Maryland Head Start programs, the Maryland State Department of Education Office of Child Care and the Maryland Head Start Association to implement and evaluate a multi-level intervention for pediatric asthma entitled Head Start Controls Asthma in Preschoolers (HS-CAP), built upon our evidence-based asthma interventions. We propose to leverage a recent policy initiative, Maryland EXCELS that provides incentives for child care centers to obtain quality ratings in asthma care. The purpose of this planning grant will be to identify and engage Head Start and other key community stakeholders to conduct a community needs assessment based on the USDHHS community needs assessment toolkit that will inform necessary refinement and adaptations of HS-CAP, and establish strong partnerships to ensure successful implementation of the HS-CAP program. Results of this project will directly inform a controlled trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of the HS-CAP program in improving child asthma outcomes, as well as help identify best practices for implementation of an asthma care program within a statewide early childhood education program, such as Head Start.

"The Asthma Neighborhood: Collaborative for Asthma Equity (CASE) in Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): Hartford, CT is a city of health disparity and inequity with high rates of poverty, unemployment and old housing stock. Hartford children (43% Hispanic (predominantly Puerto Rican) and 38% African American) suffer disproportionately from childhood asthma with high asthma morbidity. The goal of this planning grant is to create an Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP) that engages multiple asthma sectors in Hartford to maximize programmatic synergies and to conduct a community needs assessment, the results of which will be used to refine a clinical trial to evaluate the ACIP. The ACIP identifes children with asthma at risk for poor outcomes, is community-based, grounded in theory and uses electronic technology and community-based participatory research (CBPR) methodologies to create a cross-sector asthma care program. To achieve this goal, this planning grant will create the Hartford Collaborative for Asthma Equity (CASE) (the ""Collaborative""), composed of researchers, families, children with asthma, schools, school-based health clinics, local pharmacy, primary care clinicians, asthma specialists, local and state health departments, community organizations, payers of medical services and housing operators. From each member's individual perspective, the Collaborative will create an asthma neighborhood that collectively supports families. Features of the asthma neighborhood include identifying children with asthma at high risk for poor outcomes; cross-sector, consistent asthma education; and creation of a communication/information sharing platform that includes the child's asthma treatment plan and medical services utilization data. Informed by secondary data and the results of the community needs assessment, the Collaborative will refine a clinical trial that integrates 4 evidence-based interventions (Easy Breathing, an asthma management program for primary care clinicians; a school-based asthma program; a Community Health worker home visitation program adapted to asthma; and Healthy Homes, a home environmental remediation program) into a new model of care for children at risk of poor asthma outcomes. We hypothesize that a cross-sector, integrated system of asthma care will decrease asthma ED visits, hospitalizations and school absences (primary outcomes), will be sustained, reproducible and reach large numbers of children with asthma (process outcomes) and will be effective both in African American and Hispanic/Puerto Rican children, two groups with high asthma morbidity. The specific aims are: 1) to create the Hartford Collaborative for Asthma Equity composed of diverse stakeholders, 2) to conduct a community needs assessment from multiple perspectives and 3) to use the results of the community needs assessment to refine a novel integrated program of care to achieve health equity. (End of Abstract)         Project Narrative Hispanic/Puerto Rican and African American children suffer disproportionately from childhood asthma with high asthma morbidity. The goal of this planning grant is to conduct a community needs assessment and use the results to create an Asthma Care Implementation Plan that integrates multiple effective asthma programs to achieve health equity for children burdened with asthma.

"nmMLCK Contributes to Genetic and Environmental Asthma Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe asthma represents ~10% of all asthma but carries a significantly greater mortality risk especially for African descent (AD) individuals. Environmental factors (such as exposure to particulate matter air pollution or PM) and genetic factors are likely critical to defining susceptibility to severe asthma and provide insights into tis area of serious health disparity. In this regard, the non-muscle isoform of myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK), encoded by MYLK, actively participates in the pathogenesis of vascular barrier disruption and lung inflammatory cell trafficking, each an essential contributor to asthmatic inflammation. In lung endothelial cells (EC), nmMLCK is a multifunctional cytoskeletal mediator central to regulation of EC actin cytoskeletal rearrangement via phosphorylation of myosin light chains (MLCs). Our previous studies further identified that African ancestry is associated with asthma risk with coding and non- coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding nmMLCK, MYLK, over-represented in AD individuals strongly associated with severe asthma. This R01 renewal will characterize the pathobiological functions of MYLK SNPs associated with severe asthma in under-represented minority backgrounds, thereby directly addressing an important health disparity. To address our hypothesis that nmMLCK expression and functional activity (inflammatory regulation) are dysregulated in severe asthma & influenced by SNPs enriched in AD populations, Specific Aim #1 will evaluate MYLK SNPs found in non-hispanic caucasians, Latino & African descent children and adult populations for association with severe asthma. We will conduct mid-throughput genotyping studies in ~4000 asthma patients (European descent, African descent, Latino Puerto Rican, and Latino Mexican)and identify severe asthma-related SNPs. Specific Aim #2 will characterize the effects of severe asthma-associated SNPs and Paticulate Matter (PM) exposure on nmMLCK mRNA expression and function via effects on MYLK 5'UTR promoter activity, 3'UTR binding activity to miRNAs, promoter CpG island methylation, and mRNA secondary structure. Specific Aim #3 will functionally analyze effects of severe asthma-associated MYLK coding SNPs on nmMLCK protein structure and function (kinase activity, protein binding, and lamellipodial dynamics). Finally, Specific Aim #4 will validate these severe asthma-associated SNPs in vivo, and evaluate novel nmMLCK inhibitors designed to diminish PM-exacerbated asthmatic inflammatory lung injury. Supported by compelling published and preliminary data, we believe these integrated translational studies will lead to mechanistic insights into asthma pathobiology and the health disparity of severe asthma while facilitating the development of novel, potentially population-specific, inflammation-reducing therapies for asthma.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Severe asthma, representing ~10% of all asthma, carries a significantly greater mortality and is a key area of serious health disparity with Americans of African descent experiencing greater asthma mortality compared to individuals of European descent. Environmental factors (such as exposure to particulate matter air pollution) and genetic factors in genes such as MYLK may prove to be critical to defining the susceptibility to severe asthma.

"School-Based Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management (SB-TEAM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a first competing renewal of a school-based program designed to reduce morbidity for poor children with asthma by facilitating delivery of guideline-based care and improving adherence to effective preventive asthma medications. In 2006, we implemented the School Based Asthma Therapy (SBAT) trial (R01HL079954) with 530 children from more than 50 urban schools. The primary intervention for the SBAT trial consisted of directly observed administration of preventive asthma medications in school (with dose adjustments according to NHLBI guidelines). Results from this study demonstrate reduced morbidity, decreased absenteeism, and fewer exacerbations for these very high-risk children. This program has the potential to serve as a model for improved asthma care in urban communities, however several factors limit dissemination of the program in its current form. For example, extensive resources were required for screening and implementation of the program, and communications with providers for ongoing monitoring of symptoms were inefficient, often delaying recommended medication adjustments. In order for this program to have sustainable public health impact, we must now test a system that allows for full integration within the school and community systems that serve these children. In this new application we propose the next phase in our research, which represents a critical step in our expanding partnership with the city school district. We propose testing a novel school-based program (SB-TEAM - School-Based Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management), which directly builds on our prior work, for children with persistent asthma in Rochester City Elementary Schools.  We recently developed and pilot-tested the technology for web-based screening and communication for this intervention (RC1HL099432), and now propose a full-scale trial across an entire school district using this technology with the addition of telemedicin asthma assessments to assure appropriate follow-up care and optimal treatment. We hypothesize that children receiving care through SB-TEAM will experience less asthma- related morbidity compared to children in an enhanced usual care (eUC) comparison group. Further, we anticipate that the benefits will be even greater than those seen in the original SBAT trial, due t the ability to more optimally tailor each child's medication regimen. The SB-TEAM program includes systematic web-based asthma screening, directly observed administration of preventive asthma medications in school, and ongoing monitoring and tailoring of the care regimen using school-based telemedicine. Children in the eUC group will receive asthma screening with notification of their PCP, as well as systematic feedback to the parent and provider to promote appropriate guideline based follow-up care. This application represents a logical extension of our work to improve adherence to effective asthma medications that can reduce health disparities and could ultimately be sustained in communities nationwide. Urban children with asthma suffer from substantial morbidity and suboptimal preventive care. This project may have a profound impact on public health because it proposes an expansion of an innovative school- based intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines that is specifically designed to promote optimal care within an existing infrastructure. Should it prove successful in reducing symptoms and improving the health of urban children with asthma, it has the potential to serve as a sustainable model for improved asthma care for this population.",School-Based Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management (SB-TEAM),9061757,R01HL079954,"['Absenteeism ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Programs ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Parents ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Seasons ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Notification ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Interruption ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' comparison group ', ' health economics ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' airway epithelium inflammation ', ' airway inflammation ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' Therapy trial ', ' program dissemination ', ' project dissemination ', ' school district ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' urban children ', ' minority children ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2016,1218127,0.42303430201565567
"The role of ovarian hormones on allergen-mediatedd innate immune airway responses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma prevalence is greater in boys than girls, but around puberty there is a shift in asthma prevalence, and at mid-life women are about two times more likely than men to have asthma. This suggests a role for sex hormones in asthma pathogenesis; however the mechanisms remain unknown. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are important in driving the initial phase of allergic airway inflammation that is associated with asthma. ILC2 are activated by IL-33, TSLP, and IL-25 which are upregulated in response to airway allergens, including Alternaria alternata. Upon stimulation, ILC2 have increased expression of the transcription factors GATA3 and RORα and produce IL-5 and IL-13. IL-5 and IL-13 increase the infiltration of eosinophils, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and mucus production, all hallmarks of asthma. Our preliminary data showed IL- 33-stimulated ILC2 from female mice had significantly increased IL-5 and IL-13 protein expression compared to ILC2 from male mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that the ovarian hormones, 17beta-estradiol (17β-E2) and progesterone (P4), increase ILC2-induced airway inflammation. In Aim 1 we will determine the mechanisms by which sex hormones increase IL-5 and IL-13 production from ILC2. Sham-operated female and male mice, ovariectomized female mice, and orchidectomized male mice will be administered pellets containing vehicle, 17β-E2, P4, and/or testosterone. ILCs will be harvested from the bone marrow and lungs of these mice and stimulated with IL-33 ex vivo. IL-5 and IL-13 protein expression, RORα and GATA3 mRNA expression, and surface expression of ST2, a component of the IL-33 receptor, will then be determined in ILC2. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of ovarian hormones on Alternaria extract (Alt Ex)-induced innate immune-mediated airway inflammation. WT BALB/c female, male, ovariectomized, and orchidectomized mice will be challenged with Alt Ex for 4 days to initiate an innate immune response. We will then determine ILC2 cytokine expression, airway inflammation, AHR, and mucus production. This proposal will delineate a mechanism(s) by which sex hormones regulate ILC2, and it may identify potential therapeutic targets for patients, in particular women, with asthma.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will determine how the sex hormones affect protein secretion from group 2 innate immune lymphoid cells that are associated with increased airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and mucus production seen in asthma. Our findings will determine if sex hormones differentially regulate ILC2 cytokine expression and may determine potential therapeutic targets to for patients, in particular women, with asthma.

"The Asthma Action at Erie Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma Action at Erie Trial Asthma prevalence and morbidity has been increasing among children over the last three decades despite significant advances in environmental control and asthma care. The annual costs for children with asthma range between $2.0 and $3.2 billion. Asthma morbidity and its associated costs are not borne equally; they are highest for urban, low income, African American and Puerto Rican children. Community health workers (CHWs) have been growing in popularity as a potential intervention to combat these asthma disparities. CHWs are frontline public health workers who serve as liaisons between health and social services and communities to facilitate access to services and improve the quality and cultural competence of service delivery. The evidence on CHW asthma intervention efficacy has been growing but several critical gaps still exist. The Asthma Action at Erie Trial will test the ability of a CHW intervention with three important modifications to achiev asthma control in high-risk children: 1) CHWs will be integrated into both the clinical and the home setting, 2) A system for directly addressing mental health and psychosocial barriers will be provided, and 3) Participants will be provided only materials and equipment for trigger remediation that are supported by the current medical reimbursement system. A two-arm behavioral randomized controlled trial (N=220) will be conducted in partnership with a federally- qualified health center (FQHC) serving a low income, minority population that is at high-risk for significant asthma morbidity. The intervention arm will receive an integrated CHW home intervention for pediatric asthma education. The comparison arm will received clinic-based certified asthma educator (AE-C) services. Primary Aim 1 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention, relative to clinic-based AE-C education over 12-months, as demonstrated by asthma control. We hypothesize that the CHW arm will have at least 30% fewer days with activity limitation than the AE-C arm at 12-months. Specific Aim 2 is to assess maintenance of intervention efficacy, as demonstrated by asthma control at 18 and 24 months after randomization. Specific Aim 3 is to determine the cost-effectiveness at 12-months of CHW and AE-C intervention delivery, and additional costs or savings related to asthma exacerbations at 12- and 24-months. Specific Aim 4 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention relative to clinic- based AE-C education, as demonstrated by asthma control, among those experiencing depression, stress, and/or a post-traumatic stress disorder. This trial compares the current best practice in asthma self- management education (AE-C services) to an integrated CHW home intervention in which the real-life challenges of patients and the health care system are taken fully into account. This trial will provide clarity a to the expected effect size, cost savings, and resources needed to integrate asthma CHWs into clinical practice. . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma Action at Erie Trial Support for community health worker (CHW) interventions is increasing rapidly despite an incomplete evidence base. This study uses a rigorous study design to determine the efficacy of a CHW home asthma intervention integrated into the clinic for high-risk children with asthma.

"Social adversities and asthma: a new phenotype? ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a common and challenging disease of childhood that disproportionately affects poor minority populations. These populations also experience an excess of social adversities, which are important risk factors for asthma morbidity. However, the response to these adversities is variable: poverty increases the odds of asthma in African Americans, yet decreases it in Mexican Americans. Thus, there is a knowledge gap in our ability to identify individuals vulnerable to social adversities and truly at high-risk for poor asthma outcomes. I am seeking a Mentored NIH K23 Career Development Award to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading, independent researcher in asthma health outcomes. To move towards this goal, my overall objective for this award is to identify disadvantaged minority children at risk for poor asthma outcomes. My central hypothesis is a profile of demographic, social, and environmental characteristics coupled with stress-related biomarkers will predict which individuals are at high risk for poor asthma outcomes, and that this profile will vary by race/ethnicity. This will be testd with the following three aims. Specific Aim 1: Estimate the association between social adversities at individual- and community-levels with asthma susceptibility and morbidity. Social adversities have been identified from administered questionnaire, and geocoded census data obtained from personal address history through a cross-sectional study of 6200 children with and without asthma. Specific Aim 2: Examine if social adversities are associated with biomarkers of stress that may influence asthma susceptibility and morbidity. Stress-related biomarkers will be measured and a link between the biomarkers and asthma outcomes will be examined separately in African American and Latino children. Specific Aim 3: Identify a phenotype susceptible to social adversities and examine how it modifies the course of asthma using a longitudinal approach. A phenotype, or type of asthma, associated with social adversities amongst those with asthma will be identified. Participants with the identified phenotype will be recruited from the original study and followed to understand how this asthma type behaves over time in the presence of social adversities. This proposal will result in identifying an asthma phenotype that will allows us to target individuals at high-risk for poor asthma outcomes related to social adversities. This contribution is significant as utilizing stress related biomarkers may allow us to better risk stratify individuals and, potentially, capture them prior to adverse health outcomes occurring. A multi-disciplinary mentoring committee with diverse expertise: asthma (Drs. Burchard, Cabana), health disparities research (Drs. Burchard, Bibbins-Domingo, Cabana), biostatistics (Dr. Sen), and implementation sciences (Drs. Cattamanchi, Ackerman), will guide the progress of the research agenda. Their mentorship, as well as a focused training and research plan facilitated by a K23 award, will develop my expertise in health disparities research in asthma.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American and Latino children experience an excess of poor asthma outcomes and social adversities. We are limited in our ability to identify the individuals who are the most susceptible to social adversities. With this proposal, a phenotype of asthma will be identified that will better discriminate individuals at high risk for poor asthma outcomes. This will allow for the development and application of targeted interventions designed to minimize the effect of social adversities and, thus, improve asthma outcomes in vulnerable populations.        ",Social adversities and asthma: a new phenotype?,9033656,K23HL125551,"['Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Affect ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Household ', ' Influentials ', ' Lipids ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Poverty ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate ', ' Prasterone Sulfate ', ' Dehydroisoandrosterone Sulfate ', ' DHEA Sulfate ', ' DHA Sulfate ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' GALA ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' pulmonary function ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Endocrine ', ' experience ', ' income insurance ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' minority children ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2016,204987,0.4590780589726761
"Mechanisms of IL-17A-mediated enhancement of asthma severity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lung that currently afflicts more than 300 million people worldwide. While asthma is mediated by an excessive Th2 immune response to allergens, recent evidence suggests that production of the Th17 cytokine, IL-17A, is associated with the development of more severe disease. While severe asthmatics are at greatest risk for morbidity or death following acute exacerbations, and can be refractory to therapies that are highly effective in individuals with mild disease, the molecular mechanisms whereby IL-17A contributes to the development of severe allergic asthma are ill-defined. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A facilitates severe asthma would provide additional therapeutic targets for populations underserved by current therapies. Using a mouse model we provide evidence that severe asthma is associated with increased IL-17A production, and is compounded by enhanced Il17ra expression and elevated responsiveness to IL-17A. These alterations in IL-17A production and responsiveness exacerbate IL-13-driven STAT6 activation, gene expression, and airway responses. Our preliminary data suggests that IL-17A-mediated enhancement of IL-13-driven responses occur through two, non-mutually independent mechanisms in mouse cells; 1) by causing the dissociation of a complex including IL-13R�1 and TRAF3, which normally limits IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation, and 2) by activating transcription factors (NF-�B, C/EBP� and C/EBP�) which can enhance IL-13/STAT6 driven gene expression. While preliminary studies presented here also suggest that similar mechanisms may operate in human cell lines, the extent to which the observations made in our mouse model apply to humans with severe asthma is unclear. Three specific aims are proposed to identify the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A enhances asthma severity in mice, and humans. Specific Aim 1 will determine if the increased IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation and AHR observed in the presence of IL-17A is the result of the dissociation of the IL- 13R�1:TRAF3 complex following initiation of IL-17A signaling. Specific Aim 2 will dissect the importance of IL- 17A-driven activation of NF-�B (canonical versus non-canonical), C/EBP� and C/EBP� in IL-13/IL-17A synergy in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will directly test whether similar synergistic interactions between IL-13 and IL-17A are observed in asthma relevant, primary human cells. Additionally, we will determine whether severe asthma in children is associated, as it is in the mouse, with increased IL-17A production, IL17RA expression, and IL-17A responsiveness. Collectively, the studies proposed in this application will move us beyond the ""Th2 paradigm"" of allergic asthma, begin to characterize the mechanisms whereby Th17-products trigger the development of severe allergic asthma, and determine whether similar mechanisms may be at play in mice and humans. A better understanding of these mechanisms will enable us to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions in individuals with severe asthma, a population underserved by current therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Elevated IL-17A levels have been linked to the development of severe asthma in humans, a debilitating, treatment-resistant form of allergic asthma that accounts for the majority of asthma-related mortality and morbidity. However, the mechanisms through which IL-17A exacerbates disease severity remain unclear, representing an important knowledge gap that is preventing the development of novel treatments that directly address the unique disease processes driving pathogenesis in severe asthma.

"The effect of a housing mobility program on environmental exposures and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Asthma morbidity continues to be a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods despite the availability of highly effective controller medications. Major contributors to the disproportionatey high asthma morbidity in this population are exposure to pest allergens (mouse and cockroach) and indoor pollutants (particulate matter (PM) due to second hand smoke and neighborhood PM). Efforts to reduce these exposures using home environmental interventions (EIs) have had only modest effects on measures of asthma symptoms and they have had little effect on reducing acute care visits or on improving lung function which are critical markers of high health care costs and poor long-term outcomes. The limited efficacy of EIs in this high-risk population is likely due to only modest reductions of indoor allergens and pollutants achieved by EIs. Housing mobility programs offer an alternative intervention with the strong potential to achieve large reductions in allergens and pollutants and thereby improve asthma health across a broad range of indicators including acute visits and lung function. We propose to conduct such a study in the context of the Baltimore Mobility Program (BMP), the nation's largest mobility program. We have partnered with BMP, and together have found that among families in BMP who have moved away from Baltimore City, pest allergen and PM exposures are much lower than in the homes of similar children living in Baltimore City. Our preliminary data and findings to date provide strong support for the hypothesis that moving to good quality housing in a better neighborhood through a housing mobility program will result in improvements in asthma outcomes, and that these improvements will be mediated by reductions in exposure to pest allergens and indoor PM. Through prospectively recruiting and following families as they enter into the Baltimore Mobility Program, we seek to address the following specific aims: (1) To determine the effect of moving from a low-income urban neighborhood to good quality housing in a better neighborhood on asthma-related outcomes by comparing outcomes among 5-17 year old children with persistent asthma who move to similar children who do not move, and (2) To estimate the causal effects of reducing indoor pest allergens and PM by moving to better housing on asthma outcomes using principal stratification, a statistical method for causal inference in environmental studies. The proposed study has the potential to have significant implications for the role of housing policy as a tool to address asthma disparities.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma morbidity continues to be a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods, and the major contributors are thought to be due to exposures to pest allergens and indoor pollution. Reduction of home allergens and pollution is very difficult in homes in low-income urban neighborhoods where outdoor pollution is high and pest infestation is endemic, and housing mobility programs, which offer counseling and financial assistance for families to move to better neighborhoods, have strong potential to achieve large reductions in allergens and pollutants and thereby reduce asthma morbidity. Through prospectively recruiting and following families as they enter into the Baltimore Housing Mobility Program, we will determine the effect of moving from a low-income urban neighborhood to good quality housing in a better neighborhood on asthma-related outcomes among children with asthma.              ",The effect of a housing mobility program on environmental exposures and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children,9006550,R01ES026170,"['high efficiency particulate air filter ', ' HEPA cleaner ', ' HEPA Filtration ', ' HEPA Filter ', ' Indoor pollutant ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' indoor allergen ', ' mouse allergen ', ' minority children ', ' Section 8 ', ' Affect ', ' Allergens ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Baltimore ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Cockroaches ', ' Dictyoptera ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' financial assistance ', ' Financial Support ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' IgE ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Exhalation ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' pollutant ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' voucher ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' cockroach allergen ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Modification ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' environmental intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIEHS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,675664,0.1840893626729233
"Effects of Cumulative Risk on Asthma Outcomes in Urban Children and Adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric asthma disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minority children and children living in low-income, urban areas. In addition to increased asthma morbidity and healthcare use, children from urban areas are at risk for additional stressors (e.g., poverty, neighborhood stress) that can contribute to poor asthma outcomes. The continual activation of the stress response without adequate buffering (i.e., toxic stress) has been associated with the development of illnesses, including asthma. However, limited research has examined the processes related to toxic stress that may increase asthma morbidity in urban children who already carry an asthma diagnosis. The proposed study will use innovative technology (ecological momentary assessment [EMA] delivered via smartphone) to assess processes that place urban children at increased risk for poor asthma outcomes. Specifically, this study will investigate the association between a cumulative risk model of stress and child asthma outcomes (ages 7-12) in a low-income, urban sample of 60 families (87% African American), as well as the potential for caregiver support related to asthma care to serve as a protective factor in this association. Data collected from urban families with a child with persistent asthma as part of the CARE Study (Childhood Asthma in Richmond Families; Targeted Research Grant, Society of Pediatric Psychology; R. Everhart, PI) will be analyzed. This study will also examine whether a cumulative risk model is a stronger predictor of asthma outcomes in urban children than any one risk factor. Additionally, the proposed study will assess the ecological validity of two widely used stress measures. Given developmental differences between younger children and adolescents, the proposed study will also develop a new adolescent-specific cumulative risk model of stress and test its association with asthma outcomes in adolescents from urban settings. Original data will be collected from a sample of 60 urban adolescents with asthma (13-17 years) and their caregivers. Families will complete an initial research session and then adolescents will use a handheld spirometer for 14 days. Specifically the proposed study hypothesizes that: 1) more cumulative risk will be associated with poorer asthma outcomes in both groups (i.e., younger children and adolescents); 2) higher levels of caregiver support for the child's asthma care will minimize the effects of cumulative ris on child and adolescent asthma outcomes; 3) the cumulative risk model will be a stronger predictor of asthma outcomes than any one factor; 4) the adolescent-specific cumulative risk model will account for more variance in adolescent asthma outcomes than the model generated for the younger age group, and 5) higher scores on the baseline stress scales will be related to more stressors reported on the EMA daily surveys. Results will inform future research aimed at improving asthma outcomes among low-income, urban children and adolescents by better understanding the association between stress and asthma outcomes in a group most at risk for experiencing high rates of asthma morbidity and healthcare utilization.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will examine the effects of a cumulative risk model of stress on asthma outcomes in urban children and adolescents with asthma. Taking into account a toxic stress framework, the proposed study will test whether caregiver support for the child's asthma care buffers the relationship between cumulative risk and asthma outcomes.

"ACTION Intervention: Physical Activity in Minority Women with Asthma ABSTRACT Asthma is a highly prevalent chronic disease that disproportionately impacts African American (AA) women. AA women have poorer asthma-related quality of life and higher rates of asthma exacerbations, healthcare utilization and mortality compared to Caucasian women. Further, AA women are less physically active than any other subgroup of adults, which may help explain the asthma health disparities, found between AA and Caucasian women. Physical inactivity among individuals with asthma is associated with poor asthma control and respiratory function, greater health care utilization, and poorer quality of life. Given the connection between poor asthma outcomes and physical inactivity, addressing physical activity (PA) among sedentary AA women with asthma is imperative. Physical activity demonstrated improvement in asthma outcomes specifically asthma control, quality of life and healthcare utilization. Despite these benefits, fewer than 25% of AA women with asthma engage in regular physical activity. The ACTION intervention: physicAl aCtiviTy In minOrity womeN with asthma is a 8-month community-based walking intervention refined to be applicable for sedentary AA women with asthma. This application proposes to obtain and incorporate stakeholder input on the barriers and facilitators to engaging in physical activity with asthma to a validated community-based walking intervention. Once modified, we will pre-pilot the intervention in 10 participants, refine further in response to participant feedback and then test the feasibility, acceptability and estimate the efficacy of the intervention in a randomized controlled pilot of 80 participants within a pragmatic community setting convenient for sedentary AA women. Through coursework, hands-on experience and strong mentorship this project will provide the dedicated candidate with the necessary skills to become an independent investigator and build an impactful research program on designing and implementing health promotion interventions to improve asthma outcomes in minority populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Physical inactivity in asthma is associated with worse asthma outcomes and African American women are disproportionately impacted by both physical inactivity and asthma. Research aimed at addressing the unique asthma-related and cultural-specific barriers to physical activity in this vulnerable population of women is needed. The proposed study will modify a validated community-based walking intervention specific to the needs of sedentary African American women with asthma and evaluate the impact of the intervention on physical activity and asthma specific indicators to reduce the burden of asthma in sedentary African American women.  ",ACTION Intervention: Physical Activity in Minority Women with Asthma,9163908,K01HL133370,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Interview ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Physicians ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Safety ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Woman ', ' Walking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' moderate physical activity ', ' Moderate Exercise ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Modification ', ' cost ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' community safety ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' community setting ', ' public health priorities ', ' power analysis ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ', ' exercise regimen ', ' Exercise routine ', ' walking intervention ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,K01,2016,185155,0.3399383224865739
"Multi-Level Understanding of Social Contributors to SES Disparities in Asthma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in health outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES) are one of the most pressing public health problems our society faces today. In line with PAR-10-136's interest in multi-level approaches to understanding health disparities, we focus on childhood asthma and investigate factors simultaneously across neighborhood, family, and individual levels; we consider both physical environment and social environment exposures together; and we examine various levels of biological processes (organ systems, cellular, genomic) that drive asthma pathophysiology, all within a single project that seeks to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the causes of asthma disparities. The first aim is to understand how neighborhood, family, and individual-level social factors both shape and are shaped by one another, and how they collectively affect asthma disparities. The second aim is to measure social and physical exposures concurrently in order to explain how they interact to affect asthma disparities. The third aim is to create biologically plausible models for how social contexts contribute to health disparities by characterizing pathways at multiple levels biologicall (organ systems, cellular, genomic) that can explain how social contexts come to affect asthma disparities. This study will recruit a sample of 300 families from varying SES backgrounds who have a child ages 10-18 with persistent asthma. Families will participate in laboratory assessments of individual- and family-level social processes as well as child biological measures. Information on neighborhood characteristics will be linked from geographic information system maps of pollution exposures and maps of the social characteristics of communities created by a research consortium locally. In order to establish the temporal precedence of each of the 'levels' of factors, clinical outcomes will be tracked across a 1 year follow up period via monthly monitoring of symptoms as well as from hospitalization data obtained from provincial health records. Creating models that explain how neighborhood, family, and individual factors simultaneously contribute to asthma disparities is critical for developing a more holistic picture of how social contexts affect disease progression. These models will in turn shape our approaches to interventions. For example, interventions to improve medication adherence may not be effective if they do not acknowledge the broader social factors (e.g., neighborhood and family stress) that affect families' abilities to keep up with medication regimens. Assessing interactive effects between factors will also allow us to identify specific conditions under which potential targets of intervention would make the biggest differences in mitigating the pathophysiological processes underlying asthma. The overall goal of this project is to develop a more sophisticated understanding of why asthma disparities by SES exist and to identify the constellation of factors that would need to be targeted simultaneously in order to effectively alleviate these disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive, multi-level models that convincingly explain the multitude of ways in which low socioeconomic status (SES) is able to have pervasive effects on health are important for developing interventions that can maximally reduce health disparities. The proposed project will investigate social and physical environment factors across neighborhood, family, and individual levels in an effort to understand disparities by SES in childhood asthma. The overarching goal is to develop more sophisticated models of how social and physical environments affect and interact with one another to contribute to disease progression differentially in low SES children.",Multi-Level Understanding of Social Contributors to SES Disparities in Asthma,9122464,R01HL108723,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Allergens ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' authoritarian ', ' Authoritarianism ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Shapes ', ' Pollution ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Exhalation ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' health record ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' airway epithelium inflammation ', ' airway inflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,389294,0.30235554550389326
"Spatio-temporal models of allergenic pollen for human exposure and health investigations 4.4.7: Project Summary Pollen allergies afflict over 35 million Americans, and the economic cost of treating these allergies exceeds 12 billion dollars annually. The effects on human health are considerable because pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing asthma and can trigger fatal asthma attacks. Despite the importance of these public health concerns, urban areas are filled with plants that produce allergenic pollen, many of which are intentionally cultivated. This preventable situation is caused by a lack of knowledge concerning: 1) how pollen production and dispersal from individual plants leads to heterogeneity in airborne allergenic pollen concentrations on small spatial scales (e.g., tens to hundreds of meters); and 2) the extent to which exposure to allergenic pollen is responsible for triggering asthma attacks and other respiratory symptoms. This project's objective is to quantify these processes and show how allergenic pollen producing plants affect human health. The main components of this research include: • Characterizing pollen production and spatial dispersal patterns using a pollen sampling  field study focused on Norway maple (Acer platanoides), white mulberry (Morus alba),  box elder (Acer negundo), and common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia); • Creating a spatially explicit model of airborne pollen concentrations as a function of  plant composition using a comprehensive street tree database; • Adding a temporal dimension to the spatial pollen count predictions using  meteorological data, daily pollen count data from a National Allergy Bureau pollen  counting station, and a small citizen science plant phenology monitoring program; and • Linking pollen exposure to health effects including asthma attacks and respiratory  symptoms, using existing datasets collected in the study area, Detroit, MI. These include  respiratory related hospital visits extracted from geocoded Medicaid claims data and  cohort studies that tracked 255 children's respiratory health for >12 months. Understanding the contribution of particular plants to pollen concentrations in urban areas has will allow land owners, municipalities and others to actively manage plant composition to reduce allergenic pollen exposure and its health effects. These translational benefits are especially important in both highly vegetated and ""shrinking"" cities, such as Detroit, where large vacant areas are providing habitat for allergenic plants that likely exacerbate health disparities. 4.4.8: Project narrative Allergenic pollen triggers asthma attacks and causes severe allergic reactions, but little is known about how much airborne pollen particular people are exposed to. This study will quantify allergenic pollen production and dispersal in an urban area, estimate where and when pollen concentrations are high, and test how exposure affects respiratory disease.",Spatio-temporal models of allergenic pollen for human exposure and health investigations,9191743,F32ES026477,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Boxing ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Medicaid ', ' Meteorology ', ' Norway ', ' Plants ', ' Pollen ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' airway symptom ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' pulmonary function ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Blooms ', ' Blossoms ', ' Flowers ', ' Mulberry ', ' Morus ', ' Maple ', ' Acer ', ' Ragweed ', ' Ambrosia ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' meter ', ' respiratory ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' field study ', ' Municipalities ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' land use ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Habitats ', ' case control ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Plant Sources ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Allergic Reaction ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Minority ', ' exposed human population ', ' human exposure ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' respiratory health ', ' citizen science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2016,57842,0.27855278148007767
"Mechanisms of IL-17A-mediated enhancement of asthma severity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lung that currently afflicts more than 300 million people worldwide. While asthma is mediated by an excessive Th2 immune response to allergens, recent evidence suggests that production of the Th17 cytokine, IL-17A, is associated with the development of more severe disease. While severe asthmatics are at greatest risk for morbidity or death following acute exacerbations, and can be refractory to therapies that are highly effective in individuals with mild disease, the molecular mechanisms whereby IL-17A contributes to the development of severe allergic asthma are ill-defined. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A facilitates severe asthma would provide additional therapeutic targets for populations underserved by current therapies. Using a mouse model we provide evidence that severe asthma is associated with increased IL-17A production, and is compounded by enhanced Il17ra expression and elevated responsiveness to IL-17A. These alterations in IL-17A production and responsiveness exacerbate IL-13-driven STAT6 activation, gene expression, and airway responses. Our preliminary data suggests that IL-17A-mediated enhancement of IL-13-driven responses occur through two, non-mutually independent mechanisms in mouse cells; 1) by causing the dissociation of a complex including IL-13R¿1 and TRAF3, which normally limits IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation, and 2) by activating transcription factors (NF-¿B, C/EBP¿ and C/EBP¿) which can enhance IL-13/STAT6 driven gene expression. While preliminary studies presented here also suggest that similar mechanisms may operate in human cell lines, the extent to which the observations made in our mouse model apply to humans with severe asthma is unclear. Three specific aims are proposed to identify the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A enhances asthma severity in mice, and humans. Specific Aim 1 will determine if the increased IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation and AHR observed in the presence of IL-17A is the result of the dissociation of the IL- 13R¿1:TRAF3 complex following initiation of IL-17A signaling. Specific Aim 2 will dissect the importance of IL- 17A-driven activation of NF-¿B (canonical versus non-canonical), C/EBP¿ and C/EBP¿ in IL-13/IL-17A synergy in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will directly test whether similar synergistic interactions between IL-13 and IL-17A are observed in asthma relevant, primary human cells. Additionally, we will determine whether severe asthma in children is associated, as it is in the mouse, with increased IL-17A production, IL17RA expression, and IL-17A responsiveness. Collectively, the studies proposed in this application will move us beyond the ""Th2 paradigm"" of allergic asthma, begin to characterize the mechanisms whereby Th17-products trigger the development of severe allergic asthma, and determine whether similar mechanisms may be at play in mice and humans. A better understanding of these mechanisms will enable us to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions in individuals with severe asthma, a population underserved by current therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Elevated IL-17A levels have been linked to the development of severe asthma in humans, a debilitating, treatment-resistant form of allergic asthma that accounts for the majority of asthma-related mortality and morbidity. However, the mechanisms through which IL-17A exacerbates disease severity remain unclear, representing an important knowledge gap that is preventing the development of novel treatments that directly address the unique disease processes driving pathogenesis in severe asthma.

"Improving Patient-Centered Outcomes after Discharge among Patients Hospitalized with Asthma Exacerbations by Focusing on a Transition-to-Home Plan with Community Health Workers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic disease, affecting more than 10% of American children (>7 million children <18 years)1 and disproportionately impacting urban, minority, and disadvantaged children.2 Despite the evidence-based guidelines for standardized care from the NIH,3 overall morbidity among youth with asthma, whether measured by attack rates, emergency department (ED) visits, or hospitalizations, has not significantly decreased in the last decade.4 Striking disparities persist among youth with asthma, as socio- economically disadvantaged, urban, and minority children throughout the United States incur a disproportionate share of asthma-related morbidity.2,5 The overall ED visit rate for asthma, for example, among non-Hispanic African Americans (AAs) aged 0-17 years is 4.1 times greater than that among non-Hispanic whites, while the ED visit rate among Hispanics in the same age group is 1.8 times greater than non-Hispanic whites. Similarly, the asthma death rate among non-Hispanic AAs aged 0-17 years is 7.3 times greater than that among non-Hispanic whites, while the death rate among Hispanics in the same age group is 1.2 times greater than non-Hispanic whites.5 In a recent study to prioritize comparative effectiveness research in hospital pediatrics, asthma ranked as the #1 leading non-surgical diagnose for pediatric hospital admission, totaling costs of $570 million annually.6 Of striking importance for the health care system is that asthma is also in the top diagnoses for all-cause readmissions, with 80% of these asthma readmissions deemed potentially preventable readmissions.7 In this career training award, with a strong mentorship team, I propose a highly patient-centered approach to identifying and improving optimal outcomes for patients and families transitioning home after inpatient admissions for asthma exacerbations. Using the care coordination framework proposed by the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in June 2014,8 my mentors and I will utilize principles of patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) and comparative effectiveness research (CER) to design and pilot a program of community health worker (CHW)-facilitated transition-to-home focusing on the changeover of care from inpatient to outpatient for patients hospitalized with asthma exacerbation. This project is highly significant (addressing a vulnerable transition for patients admitted with a common and costly pediatric chronic illness with high rate of preventable readmissions) and highly innovative (using a qualitative approach to identify stakeholders' perspectives to refine AHRQ's care coordination framework to improve the transition from hospital to home by utilizing CHW and pilot testing feasibility and acceptability, and patient-centered outcomes). Our overall aim is to develop and evaluate a patient-centered transition-to-home plan leveraging CHWs to target high risk pediatric patients requiring hospital admission for asthma exacerbations.

"Vitamin D, Steroids, and Asthma in African American Youth Abstract  Further studies are urgently needed in order to identify effective and sustainable strategies for reducing the dramatic health disparities experienced by disadvantaged, urban, and minority youth with asthma. Vitamin D deficiency is more common among African American (AA) individuals, especially those from urban environments or with obesity. We and others have contributed to increasing evidence that vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to more severe asthma through increased risk of respiratory infection and decreased glucocorticoid sensitivity. Indeed, low vitamin D levels were recently linked with the need for exogenous glucocorticoids and increased asthma severity. Particularly relevant to health disparities, we showed a strong association between vitamin D insufficiency and asthma in urban African American (AA) youth. Because AA youth residing in urban Washington, DC have markedly worse asthma than other racial/ethnic groups (e.g. prevalence rate 20% higher than the national rate 15 and emergency department utilization rates up to 5 times the national rates and nearly 10 times the Healthy People 2010 target rate), we will utilize our access to this population at the extreme of asthma disparities to examine the contribution of vitamin D to disparities in the chronic control and acute severity of asthma. The overall goal of this application is to provide critical epidemiological/molecular information that will inform the interpretation of ongoing and impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma. The knowledge generated by the experiments in this application will be crucial to translation of this inexpensive, easily-accessible potential therapy for asthma. We hypothesize that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels are associated with poor chronic asthma control, worse acute asthma severity, and glucocorticoid insensitivity. AIM 1.

"Gene-Environment Analyses of Early Life Exposures and Asthma in Ethnically Diverse Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a multifactorial disease with environmental and genetic contributions. We demonstrated that the harm caused by early-life exposures to air pollution and tobacco varies among different racial/ethnic groups. Our recent genome-wide association studies have identified both shared and ethnic-specific genetic risk factors for asthma and asthma-related traits. Our findings imply that both genes and early-life environmental exposures are important contributors to asthma susceptibility in minority children. We hypothesize that racial/ethnic differences in asthma susceptibility are due to gene-environment interactions resulting from early-life exposure to air pollution and tobacco. We will use existing genome-wide SNP genotypes and two distinct but complimentary approaches-admixture mapping and novel genome-wide GxE interaction scanning methods-to investigate the relationship between genetics, early-life air pollution and tobacco smoke exposures, and asthma risk. Specific Aim 1: Ancestry by environment interaction analysis of asthma in minority children. We will use genome-wide estimates of local chromosomal ancestry (African, European, and Native American) to perform an admixture mapping by environment (AxE) scan in 6,536 Latino and African American children from across the U.S. We will fine map AxE interaction peaks by performing targeted GxE analyses of genotyped and imputed SNPs from CAAPA and the Thousand Genomes Project. Results will be replicated using similar outcomes and exposures in the Mexico City Childhood Asthma Study (MCCAS). Specific Aim 2: Genome-wide by environment (GxE) interaction analysis of asthma in ethnically diverse children with and without asthma. We will use a novel two-step analytical method to perform a genome-wide scan at 38.9 million SNPs for GxE interactions with air pollution and tobacco smoke exposure. Scans will be performed in our combined resource of 8,138 children, as well as within Latino, European, and African American subgroups. Results will be replicated using similar outcomes and exposures in MCCAS. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We will identify genes and genetic loci whereby gene-environment interactions play an important role in asthma etiology, and thus retrieve part of the missing heritability of asthma. We will identify significant shared and ethnic specific gene-environment interactions, which will further our understanding of racial/ethnic differences in asthma susceptibility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic and early-life environmental exposures are important contributors of asthma risk. Some racial/ethnic groups are more susceptible than others to developing asthma following early-life exposure to air pollution and tobacco smoke. Our goal is to untangle how the interplay between genetics and early-life exposures to air pollution and tobacco explain racial/ethnic differences in asthma risk among Latino and African American children.

"Asthma symptom perception feedback intervention for ethnic minority adolescents DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under-perception of asthma symptoms in children is a major risk factor for emergency department visits, hospitalizations, near-fatal and fatal asthma attacks. Puerto Rican and Black children have greater asthma morbidity and mortality rates than all other racial/ethnic groups. Interventions targeting asthma symptom perception and medication adherence may help to close the asthma health disparities gap in ethnic minority children. However, there is a paucity of literature on interventions to improve children's asthma symptom perception accuracy. This R01 study builds upon two of the PI's prior asthma symptom perception grants on ethnic minority, inner-city children with asthma. Children who saw their peak expiratory flow (PEF) after entering a PEF prediction on an electronic spirometer were less likely to under-perceive asthma symptoms and had greater adherence with controller medication use than children who did not see their PEF. The proposed double-blind, comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial consists of two arms: PEF feedback (N = 130) versus control feedback (N = 130). Participants will include Latino and Black children with asthma ages 7-17 years old and their primary caregivers. Children will be recruited from clinics in the Bronx, NY. The primary aims are to examine the effectiveness of PEF prediction with feedback versus control feedback on 1) under-perception of asthma symptoms and 2) adherence to controller medications at post- intervention and across a 1-year follow-up, and 3) under-perception assessed in clinic, asthma control, and emergency health care use across a 1-year follow-up. An exploratory aim examines the hypothesized pathway that the intervention reduces under-perception of symptoms and increases children's and parents' asthma management self-efficacy, resulting in greater medication adherence and improved asthma control. Participants will complete a baseline visit followed by 3 weeks of PEF prediction without feedback using a programmable, electronic spirometer. Participants will then return to receive random group assignment by reprogramming their spirometer, showing either the actual PEF or a brief, positive message (""Great job in remembering to use your peak flow meter!""). For the next 6 weeks, all children will guess their PEF and receive feedback (actual PEF value or control feedback). Predictions of PEF will be locked in before children blow into the device. Participants will return for a post-intervention visit after 6 weeks, and the device reprogrammed to provide no feedback for the next 4 weeks to assess sustainability of effects. A 1-month post-intervention visit will take place to download the symptom perception data from home. Adherence to controller medications will be monitored by electronic devices. Additional follow-up sessions will take place at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-intervention to collect adherence data, conduct spirometry and assess asthma control, which will be rated by providers who are blinded to intervention group, using national guidelines. Medical record abstraction will compare emergency health care use for asthma between groups across the 12-month post-intervention period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An intervention to improve asthma symptom perception has great potential to reduce the immense ethnic disparities that exist in asthma outcomes. Prediction of peak expiratory flow followed by feedback can be applied on a large-scale level due to the accessibility of peak flow meters, brevity of the intervention, and immediate learning effects. Guessing peak expiratory flow can be appealing for children, and it does not require any cultural adaptation due to the common language of peak expiratory flow.",Asthma symptom perception feedback intervention for ethnic minority adolescents,9260996,R01HL128260,"['Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Age ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' lumen dilator ', ' Bronchodilators ', ' Bronchial-Dilating Agents ', ' Bronchodilator Agents ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Control Groups ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feedback ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Spirometry ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vital capacity ', ' Forced Vital Capacity ', ' Work ', ' Bronchoconstriction ', ' Bronchial Constriction ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Self Management ', ' Blinded ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Mexican ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' meter ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dominican ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Peak Expiratory Flow ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' ER care ', ' ED care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' post intervention ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' group intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' arm ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' primary caregiver ', ' primary care giver ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' minority children ', ' Cuban ', ' ']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2016,805311,0.3240361705378685
"School-Based Asthma Care for Teens (SB-ACT) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood, and despite current advances in therapies, morbidity and mortality continue to increase. Low-income, minority teenagers have disproportionately high rates of asthma morbidity, including excess risk of emergency department care, hospitalization, and death from asthma, compared to white adolescents. Although urban children suffer the largest burden from asthma, they are the least likely group to receive adequate preventive care, and poor adherence plays a significant contributing role in asthma morbidity. Inner city adolescents with asthma are at particular risk of nonadherence.  Thus, there is a substantial amount of suffering that could be prevented with improvements in care. This application builds on our extensive experience with efficacious school-based programs for urban children and teens with asthma. The overall goal is to broadly disseminate a novel system of asthma care throughout the entire city school district ('School Based Asthma Care for Teens'; SBACT), and test its effectiveness in improving adherence and reducing morbidity among urban teens.  The SB-ACT intervention includes two core components. First, adolescents visit the school nurse daily for 6-8 weeks at the start of the school year to receive a trial of directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medications. The goal is for the teen to establish a relationship with the nurse, learn proper medication technique, and experience the benefits and value of daily preventive therapy. Four to 6 weeks after the initiation of DOT, the teen will receive a motivational interviewing (MI) counseling program designed to  enhance the teen's motivation to transition to independent, sustained preventive medication use. We will train community-based nurses affiliated with the local American Lung Association to deliver the MI component. The MI nurse will conduct three counseling sessions with the teen at school, which are designed to capitalize on the teen's experience with DOT and the potential benefits they experienced. Given the complex nature of  asthma care in this population, we plan to evaluate this intervention using a 3-group design in which 430 teens  will be randomly assigned to either; 1) the SB-ACT program (trial of DOT for 6-8 weeks + 3 MI counseling  sessions); 2) DOT-only (DOT only for 6-8 weeks); or 3) an asthma education (AE) comparison group (in-school  asthma education delivered by a trained asthma educator). We include the DOT-only group to evaluate whether this component alone is sufficient to promote sustained adherence without counseling. The AE group is designed to enhance asthma care and control for the attention received in MI counseling. We will assess the effectiveness of the SB-ACT intervention in reducing asthma morbidity, perform an economic sustainability analysis, and evaluate each component of program implementation with a focus on sustainability and dissemination. At the completion of the study, the effectiveness of this system of school-based asthma care will be better defined as a sustainable means to improve care for adolescents and reduce health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urban adolescents with asthma suffer from substantial morbidity and suboptimal preventive care. This project may have a profound impact on public health because it proposes the implementation of an innovative, efficacious intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines throughout an entire urban school district. Built upon our extensive prior work in the city schools, this program has the potential t serve as a sustainable model to improve asthma care for this understudied population and reduce health disparities.",School-Based Asthma Care for Teens (SB-ACT),9065642,R18HL116244,"['Absenteeism ', ' Accounting ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Belief ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nurses ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Nurse Training Schools ', ' Nursing Schools ', ' secondary education ', ' Secondary Schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' satisfaction ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Guideline Adherence ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' age group ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' Directly Observed Therapy ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' American Lung Association ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' ER care ', ' ED care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' post intervention ', ' comparison group ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' chronic care model ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' demographics ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' intervention effect ', ' arm ', ' Therapy trial ', ' school district ', ' improved outcome ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' urban children ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R18,2016,728470,0.41219125723709243
"A Self-Regulation Intervention for Older Adults with Asthma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma in older adults has been overlooked, understudied, and inadequately treated. While asthma programs targeting the unique needs of children, teenagers, women, minorities, and other populations have been successfully developed, there are currently none for older adults. This is particularly distressing as the asthma hospitalization rates, mortality rates, quality of life, and control are significantly worsein the elderly as compared to other age groups. It is clear that novel approaches are needed to improve the care in this population.  Our group has been active in the research of asthma in the elderly. We have analyzed national asthma data sets to look for disparities in older adults, have conducted qualitative research to determine factors associated with poor control in the elderly, and have performed a pilot study of a self- regulation intervention which was able to improve outcomes. We also have over 20 years of experience in asthma self-regulation interventions and physician communication enhancement for multiple populations of asthma patients. We will combine these strengths into our current protocol.  The intervention program will be based on the self-regulation theory of behavior, which will enhance the participants' ability to self-manage this chronic condition, actively involve the participant in their own health care management, and produce sustained results. In this application, we will evaluate a self-regulation asthma intervention in a diverse population of older adults. The intervention will be personalized to the challenges and goals each individual faces, which will enhance its applicability in different populations. This intervention will incorporate standard asthma education, complementary techniques for which older adults have expressed a strong interest, and enhanced communication with each participant's physician. Asthma specific outcomes will be assessed at one, six, and 12 months. The primary goal of this intervention is to decrease health care utilization (emergency department, urgent care, hospital, and unscheduled visits) for older adults with asthma. We will also assess the ability to improve quality of life, asthma symptoms, asthma control, lung function parameters, self-efficacy, and cost effectiveness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because adverse asthma outcomes disproportionally affect older adults, yet very little research has been directed towards this population. The proposed intervention directly addresses the National Institute on Aging's mission of extending and improving the healthy, active years of life.",A Self-Regulation Intervention for Older Adults with Asthma,9066103,R01AG043401,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Locales ', ' Respiratory Function Tests ', ' Lung Function Tests ', ' Pulmonary function tests ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' airway symptom ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Spirometry ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Sample Size ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Exhalation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' intervention effect ', ' urgent care ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,310554,0.2839664889054269
"Epigenetic Variation and Childhood Asthma in Puerto Ricans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Puerto Rican (PR) children have the highest prevalence, morbidity and mortality from asthma of all ethnic groups in the United States. Recent evidence suggests that heritable and/or de novo changes in gene expression that occur without alterations in DNA sequence (epigenetic) influence the pathogenesis of asthma. In contrast to a large number of genetic studies, few studies have examined the epigenetics of asthma. The best studied epigenetic mechanism is DNA methylation, the covalent addition of a methyl group to a cytosine residue occurring mostly in a CpG site (i.e., DNA sequence with a cytosine next to a guanine). We hypothesize that DNA methylation of CpG sites in/near genes relevant to immune response and lung function influence the pathogenesis of asthma in PR children. To test this hypothesis, we will first conduct a genome-wide study of methylation (GWM) and asthma in 80 members of 40 pairs of PR monozygotic (MZ) twins ages 6 to 14 years (20 pairs of MZ twins discordant for asthma and 20 pairs of MZ twins concordant for asthma) using DNA from white blood cells (WBCs) and nasal epithelial cells (Specific Aim 1). In parallel with this twin study, we will conduct a GWM and asthma and its intermediate phenotypes (lung function measures and allergy markers) in a) 760 PR children with (cases, n=380) and without (controls, n=380) asthma using DNA from WBCs, and b) 500 PR children with (n=250) and without (n=250) asthma using DNA from nasal epithelium (Specific Aim 2). We will then assess whether selected environmental/lifestyle (EL) exposures (environmental tobacco smoke, vitamin D insufficiency and maternal/child psychosocial stress) are associated with the top methylation findings from Sp. Aim 2 (Specific Aim 3a). Finally, we will validate selected methylation measurements from our prior aims by conducting pyrosequencing assays and gene expression studies in a subset of study participants. We will then then conduct replication studies in an independent cohort (Asthma BRIDGE [Specific Aim 3b]). This proposal should identify novel epigenetic markers of asthma (including environmentally-induced asthma) in PR children. To achieve this goal, we have assembled an experienced multidisciplinary research team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of DNA methylation changes associated with asthma in Puerto Rican children should yield novel biomarkers of asthma, including environmentally-induced asthma.

"The role of ovarian hormones on allergen-mediatedd innate immune airway responses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma prevalence is greater in boys than girls, but around puberty there is a shift in asthma prevalence, and at mid-life women are about two times more likely than men to have asthma. This suggests a role for sex hormones in asthma pathogenesis; however the mechanisms remain unknown. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are important in driving the initial phase of allergic airway inflammation that is associated with asthma. ILC2 are activated by IL-33, TSLP, and IL-25 which are upregulated in response to airway allergens, including Alternaria alternata. Upon stimulation, ILC2 have increased expression of the transcription factors GATA3 and RORα and produce IL-5 and IL-13. IL-5 and IL-13 increase the infiltration of eosinophils, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and mucus production, all hallmarks of asthma. Our preliminary data showed IL- 33-stimulated ILC2 from female mice had significantly increased IL-5 and IL-13 protein expression compared to ILC2 from male mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that the ovarian hormones, 17beta-estradiol (17β-E2) and progesterone (P4), increase ILC2-induced airway inflammation. In Aim 1 we will determine the mechanisms by which sex hormones increase IL-5 and IL-13 production from ILC2. Sham-operated female and male mice, ovariectomized female mice, and orchidectomized male mice will be administered pellets containing vehicle, 17β-E2, P4, and/or testosterone. ILCs will be harvested from the bone marrow and lungs of these mice and stimulated with IL-33 ex vivo. IL-5 and IL-13 protein expression, RORα and GATA3 mRNA expression, and surface expression of ST2, a component of the IL-33 receptor, will then be determined in ILC2. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of ovarian hormones on Alternaria extract (Alt Ex)-induced innate immune-mediated airway inflammation. WT BALB/c female, male, ovariectomized, and orchidectomized mice will be challenged with Alt Ex for 4 days to initiate an innate immune response. We will then determine ILC2 cytokine expression, airway inflammation, AHR, and mucus production. This proposal will delineate a mechanism(s) by which sex hormones regulate ILC2, and it may identify potential therapeutic targets for patients, in particular women, with asthma.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will determine how the sex hormones affect protein secretion from group 2 innate immune lymphoid cells that are associated with increased airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and mucus production seen in asthma. Our findings will determine if sex hormones differentially regulate ILC2 cytokine expression and may determine potential therapeutic targets to for patients, in particular women, with asthma.

"Genetics of lung function and asthma severity in African Americans     DESCRIPTION: Severe, therapy-resistant asthma is a challenging disorder affecting ~10-15% of all asthmatics that is associated with persistent airway inflammation and progressive lung function deficits despite treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Although the mechanisms underlying severe asthma are poorly understood, racial disparities are evident among affected patients and suggest a potential role for genetics in the modulation of the disorder. In the U.S., African Americans are nearly twice as likely (compared to whites) to have current severe asthma independent of socioeconomic status, resulting in a two-fold increase in hospitalizations and a four-fold increase in asthma death. Furthermore, African Americans are twice as likely to have persistent airflow limitation and progressive loss of lung function despite equivalent treatment. However, African Americans have been poorly represented in asthma studies and thus there is an urgent need for research targeting African Americans to unravel the mechanisms and genetic underpinnings of severe asthma in this high-risk population. Although genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cross-sectional lung function measures in asthma patients, these studies were predominantly conducted in general populations of European whites and thus are of questionable relevance to African Americans. Furthermore, the clinical ""utility"" or ""meaningfulness"" of these SNPs in predicting other relevant asthma outcomes in this population remains unclear. Therefore, through a prospective, genotype- stratified cohort study, this application will determine whether SNPs in a panel of lung function genes predict asthma severity in African American children and adults with persistent asthma treated with ICS. The specific aims are to: 1) stratify and phenotype African American children and adults with persistent asthma by genotype 2) determine whether genotype predicts longitudinal asthma severity in African American children and adults with persistent asthma, and 3) refine the gene model for asthma severity in African American children and adults with ancestral genetic markers. Emory and Wake Forest have a long history of collaboration and together have led the initiative for phenotypic and genomic analyses of severe asthma. The findings generated here are expected to generate novel information on the contribution of genomic variants to severe asthma in African Americans. Given the increased morbidity associated with asthma in African Americans, these findings will lay important groundwork to advance personalized genomics approaches for this challenging and understudied population. This study is also in keeping with the mission of the NINR to improve quality of life by managing the symptoms of chronic illnesses (severe asthma) and to enhance research innovation through application of interdisciplinary approaches to improve the health of asthma patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of asthma is significantly greater in African Americans and is highlighted by increased asthma- related hospitalizations and deaths despite equivalent treatment. To understand whether genetic differences underlie racial disparities associated with asthma, we will conduct a prospective, genotype-stratified cohort study to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a panel of genes predicts asthma severity (lung function decline and exacerbations) in African American children and adults with persistent asthma treated with ICS. These findings will generate novel information on the contribution of genomic variants to severe asthma in African Americans and will lay important groundwork to advance personalized medicine for this challenging and understudied population.            ",Genetics of lung function and asthma severity in African Americans,9037522,R01NR013700,"['Human Genetics ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Pulmonary Medicine ', ' Pneumonology ', ' Pneumology ', ' Pulmonology ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' forest ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Oncogene INT3 ', ' NOTCH4 ', ' NOTCH3 ', ' Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus Integration Site 3 ', ' INT3 ', ' Drosophila Homolog of NOTCH 4 ', ' Drosophila Homolog of NOTCH 3 ', ' NOTCH4 gene ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Targeted Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' airway epithelium inflammation ', ' airway inflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' gene panel ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' asthmatic ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Genetic study ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genomic effort ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' lumen dilator ', ' Bronchodilators ', ' Bronchial-Dilating Agents ', ' Bronchodilator Agents ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,480192,0.4048564106472622
"SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The proliferation of smartphones and sensors has made continuous monitoring of physiology, environment, and public health notifications possible. However, personalized digital health and patient empowerment will become reality only if massive multisensory and multimodal observational data is processed within patient context and made actionable to enable early detection; better diagnosis, effective prevention and treatment of the disease; and improve the quality of life. This research will be performed in the context of asthma, which affects 300 million people and claims over 250,000 lives worldwide annually. According to CDC, 9.3% of US children have asthma. Understanding asthma and its management is challenging; it is a multifactorial disease with subjective causes and symptoms, and extant diagnosis and treatment guidelines can be improved using evidence-based action recommendation. With the advent of mobile and connected sensors, timely information about asthma triggers has become available, and its exploitation requires precisely understanding and quantifying the sensed data's role for preventive and proactive assessment of asthma. In this application led by computer scientists and a practicing clinician, we address the central problem of deriving actionable information from data monitored using kHealth technology. Through a pilot study, we have tested our kHealth kit equipped on several pediatric patients under the guidance of a clinical doctor for reliable data collection and patient operation, with promising initial results. We build on this foundation by addressing the problem of semantic representation, integration, abstraction, and personalized interpretation of heterogeneous observations spanning physiological, environmental data, and online data in the context of medical knowledge. Our primary hypothesis is that an evidence-based approach to asthma can help doctors determine more precisely the cause, severity and control of asthma, and can alert patients to seek timely clinical assistance to better manage asthma. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This application direclty relates to NICHD mission of improving health of children, with focus on asthma that affects a significant population.

"Mentoring and Patient Oriented Research in Asthma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Dr. Diette is Associate Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he has joint appointments in Epidemiology and Environmental Health Sciences at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Since joining the faculty, Dr. Diette has served as mentor to more than 20 trainees, including 14 postdoctoral fellows.  With rare exception, his mentees have gone on to highly productive academic careers, garnering honors and receiving NIH grant support (NRSA, K23, R21, R01 U01 and Project Leader on program grants). The majority of his professional life has been dedicated to the conduct of research, presentation and dissemination of findings and establishing a steady base of research funding from the NIH and other sources. The focus of Dr. Diette's career has been on patient-oriented research in asthma, especially race-based health care disparities and environmental determinants of the disease. The main purpose of this K24 proposal is to provide relief from clinical and administrative duties in order to expand the POR program and dedicate additional time and energy to current and future trainees. Thus, the overall aims of this proposal are: Aim 1: To enhance the candidate's capacity to mentor clinician scientists in patient-oriented research; and Aim 2: To expand the candidate's clinical research program in directions that create new scientific opportunities for him and his mentees.          Dr. Diette directs the ASTHMA-DIET, a program award examining how diet contributes to asthma susceptibility in children and co-directs the Hopkins DISCOVER program, which investigates mechanisms by which allergens and pollutants provoke inflammation and oxidative stress. These programs are the research homes for his current mentees. These multi-project programs bring together broad scientific expertise from allergists, pulmonologists, adult and pediatric medicine, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, environmental health engineers and others. While substantial evidence now exists for the role of the indoor environment in pediatric asthma, there is insufficient evidence of the biologic mechanisms by which allergens and pollutants may provoke inflammation and oxidative stress in inner city adults.  As adults with asthma endure the majority (90%) of mortality attributed to the disease, treatments are inadequate, especially in the area of environmental control.  A major focus of this proposal will be to expand the present research program from inner city children to also include inner city adults. The proposed cohort of 100 inner city adults with asthma will examine the extent to which indoor particulate matter provokes oxidative stress and inflammation.  With this expansion in the research program, the candidate will provide the foundation for future trials in adults of home-based multi- component environmental interventions, goals which are concordant with the career goals of current mentees and will establish the infrastructure for future mentees with a research interest in adult asthma. NARRATIVE  This award will have two major impacts on public health. First, it will expand the pool of researchers capable of patient oriented research, which is necessary for translation of research findings into viable asthma treatments. Second, the research program will add to the knowledge of how to reduce the burden of asthma in inner city adults, a group that suffers disproportionate morbidity and mortality from the disease.",Mentoring and Patient Oriented Research in Asthma,9068098,K24ES021098,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Allergens ', ' Appointment ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Award ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' IgE ', ' Inflammation ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Environmental Protection ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' inner city ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' member ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' NRSA ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' Adult asthma ', ' environmental intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Indoor environment ', ' asthmatic ', ' mouse allergen ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' associate professor ', ' associate faculty ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NIEHS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2016,185487,0.3144499978171081
"Ancestry-Environmental Exposure Interactions and Asthma Risk in Admixed Population Project Summary/Abstract The burden of asthma is disproportionately high among minority children, in particular children of African descent. African American (AA) children are four times more likely to be hospitalized and seven times more likely to die from asthma than non-AAs. Recent studies have identified genetic and environmental exposure factors that contribute to asthma risk; however, the extent to which these factors interact to explain a person’s risk to asthma remains largely unknown. Our long-term goal is to develop a program of study that would lead to an in-depth understanding of the complex interplay between genetic and non-genetic causes of asthma among AA children, and establish the utility of this information to reduce and predict asthma risk in children. The objective of this study is to investigate the interactions between genetic ancestry and environmental exposure risk factors contributing to asthma risk in AA children using a well characterized cohort with banked DNA samples, environmental exposure and clinical data as well as ancestry informative markers. We hypothesize that genetic variants with large allele frequency differences and variation in environmental exposures between African and European ancestry may be partly responsible for the current difference in asthma risk in African American admixed ancestry. Moreover, ancestry and environmental exposure may jointly influence the variation and development of asthma. Two Specific Aims are proposed to test our hypothesis and achieve our proposed plan: Aim 1) Determine local and global genetic ancestry in AA asthmatic children using ancestry informative markers (AIMs); and Aim 2) Identify interactions between local ancestry and environmental exposure risk factors. The proposed study is highly significant (it addresses a major public health issue given the high burden of asthma among minority children) and highly innovative (it dissects the genetic and non- genetic causes of asthma disparities using ancestry mapping). Ultimately, this research may provide the link and insight between asthma and genetic and non-genetic factors and has potential avenues for intervention. Success in this R03 application will provide key knowledge and data to apply for fundable R01 grant application related to racial disparities in childhood asthma. We therefore believe that this pilot study along with future studies will uncover fundamental information about whether genetic factors and selected environmental exposure factors as well as their interactions can affect asthma risk and prediction, thereby reducing the burden of asthma on patients and their families and improving their quality of life. 1 Project Narrative Despite advances in asthma care, African American (AA) are 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 7 times more likely to die from asthma than non-AAs; it is unclear whether this disparity solely represents differences in environmental exposure (e.g., traffic, mold), genetic predisposition, or a combination of the two. In this pilot study, we will determine the role of ancestry variation and its interaction with environmental exposure factors in modulating asthma risk. Our long-term goal is to develop a program of study that would lead to an in-depth understanding of the complex interplay between genetic and non-genetic causes of asthma, and establish the utility of this information to reduce and predict asthma risk in children.",Ancestry-Environmental Exposure Interactions and Asthma Risk in Admixed Population,9170155,R03HL133713,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Allergens ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Funding ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Genetic ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Molds ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Tobacco smoke ', ' Clinic ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' trafficking ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Sampling ', ' DNA bank ', ' DNA Library ', ' repository ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' asthmatic ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' study population ', ' minority children ', ' ']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R03,2016,78000,0.3469470813602109
"Reducing Asthma Morbidity in High Risk Minority Preschool Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite advances in asthma therapies and the wide-spread dissemination of asthma clinical guidelines, low-income, minority children have disproportionately high morbidity and mortality from asthma. The National Center for Children in Poverty has strongly argued that effective interventions to improve asthma health disparities and reduce harm must begin in early childhood. Previous efficacy studies have suggested that asthma education programs can be effective in improving overall management of asthma for preschool children. However, for these promising asthma intervention strategies to have sustainable public health impact for low-income, minority children they must be integrated within those medical, educational and social structures that serve these young high risk children, such as community clinics, schools and day care programs. Because one of the core missions of federally- funded Head Start programs is to provide preventive health services and screening to their low-income preschool students, Head Start represents an ideal community setting for disseminating early asthma education. We propose to draw on our established health and research partnership with Head Start programs in Baltimore City to test the effectiveness of this home-based asthma education intervention with demonstrated efficacy, when delivered in the context of a Head Start-wide asthma education program. We further propose to partner with Head Start to support and evaluate adoption, maintenance and dissemination of new knowledge gained from this project. Specifically we hypothesize that participants receiving the ABC intervention combined with a HS-level asthma education will have more symptom free days at the 6-, 9-, and 12-month evaluation when compared with participants in the HS- level asthma education alone. We plan to enroll of 406 children age 2-6 years old enrolled in Head Start with symptomatic asthma. Secondary outcome measures include other measures of asthma morbidity (i.e., hospitalizations, ED visits, oral steroid bursts, school absences, and caregiver quality of life). We will also evaluate the mediating effects of outcomes expectancies, self-efficacy, asthma knowledge, motivation, and asthma management practices, as well as moderator effects, such as health literacy, caregiver depression, neighborhood cohesion, family management of asthma, and Head Start adoption and dissemination of an asthma education curriculum. Despite advances in asthma therapies and the wide-spread dissemination of asthma clinical guidelines, low-income, minority children have disproportionately high morbidity and mortality from asthma. The current study will test the effectiveness of this home-based asthma education intervention with demonstrated efficacy, when delivered in the context of a Head Start-wide asthma education program in improving asthma morbidity.

"Pediatric Asthma Disparities: The Role of Sleep and Immune Balance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K24 application proposes a mentorship program in patient-oriented research in multi-level contributors to pediatric asthma health disparities, wih a focus on sleep and immune balance. The K24 Candidate is an Associate Professor (Research) in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior of the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, with a history of funding in behavioral interventions and longitudinal research aimed at improving asthma outcomes in urban children and addressing health disparities in pediatric asthma. Training Plan: The candidate will obtain additional training in asthma clinical immunology and sleep physiology, including state-of the art methods to assess immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep, and in-lab methods to assess sleep phenomenology through experimental approaches. Research Plan: The research proposed involves an innovative investigation of the effects of experimental sleep disruption on immune balance (Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio-Th1/Th2R; plasma IL-6 -pIL-6), and associated changes in asthma- related lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) and daytime performance in urban children with persistent asthma (8-10 years old). Forty children and their primary caregiver will each participate in a within-subjects protocol, with two experimental sleep conditions: baseline sleep (1 overnight, in-lab polysomnographic (PSG) sleep study), followed by sleep fragmentation (1 overnight, in-lab PSG). Prior to each condition, children will follow a 6-day sleep stabilization schedule at home. We will monitor sleep and lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) daily to confirm eligibility and adherence to sleep criteria, and assess asthma status. We include assessments of immune biomarkers and daytime performance following each condition. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentoring Plan: The proposed mentoring plan offers opportunities for mentorship of postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty with interests in POR. Mentees will be involved in ongoing longitudinal and intervention studies on pediatric asthma disparities, including the proposed research, which will focus on biological-based processes that contribute to asthma and sleep in urban children. A strong emphasis is placed on the recruitment and selection of minority mentees. This overall plan capitalizes on the rich resources and training opportunities available to postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty at Brown Medical School, including several T32 fellowship programs, numerous junior faculty with K awards and small grants, a commitment to diversity in training, seminars in research design, ethics, and statistics, and an established infrastructure for evaluation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pediatric health disparities in the area of asthma and sleep continue to exist. Urban poverty and poorly controlled asthma can both adversely impact sleep quality by disrupting the continuity of nighttime sleep. Increased asthma symptoms and sleep disruption have each been linked with changes in immune balance. The immune imbalance associated with asthma in children may be greater in the context of sleep disruption, and this may adversely impact daytime functioning and increase inflammation that can bring on asthma symptoms. This K24 application will provide mentorship in patient-oriented research to post-doctoral fellows, residents, and junior faculty interested in multi-level contributing factors to disparities in pediatric asthma. The research proposed involves the implementation of an experimental approach to examine the effects of sleep disruption on immune imbalance, asthma-related lung function, and daytime performance in urban children (ages 8-10) with persistent, allergic asthma. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentorship goals involve providing training to post-doctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty, particularly those from minority backgrounds, in patient-oriented research focused on pediatric health disparities. The proposed career training activities to enhance knowledge and assessment of asthma clinical immunology and sleep physiology, will allow for more broadened opportunities for mentorship to trainees. In addition to the proposed research, mentees will be provided with multiple, ongoing opportunities for training in patient-oriented research on pediatric asthma health disparities.

"Text2Breathe: Enhance Parent Communication to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases, such as asthma, disproportionately affect African American (AA) children. A key recommendation of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma is partnership between healthcare providers and patients (and their parents, for children). Facilitating parents' open communication with providers regarding healthcare status and concerns can equip them to more effectively partner with their child's primary care provider (PCP). Thus, improving the health communication skills of African American (AA) parents could improve parent's adherence to treatment recommendations including utilization of the primary care for asthma care, and ultimately improve their child's asthma health outcomes. Our team recently completed a randomized controlled trial of an in- person health communication intervention that resulted in more partnerships with PCPs for asthma care and lower urgent care usage, but effects were not sustained past 2 months post-intervention. Mobile technology, such as Short Message Service (SMS, ""text messaging""), is a low-cost means of extending the dosage and scope of this intervention and may be particularly useful among AAs, for whom the use of SMS is widespread. The proposed study involves a SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention (Text2Breathe) designed to equip urban, low-income AA parents with tools/techniques to empower parents to more effectively communicate with their children's PCP. 268 AA parents of children attending an emergency department asthma education clinic will be randomized to usual care or Text2Breathe. The Text2Breathe group will receive ongoing individualized text messages providing instruction about asthma care communication during the year- long intervention period. Outcome data on parental self-efficacy and outcome expectations, adherence to asthma care treatment recommendations (e.g., primary care utilization), and child asthma outcomes will be collected via structured telephone interviews at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-enrollment. This trial can reduce pediatric health disparities by verifying the efficacy of a SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention that can extend to other chronic conditions and have health and policy implications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this text messaging intervention is to equip African American parents to effectively communicate with primary care providers about their child's asthma care needs. Increasing parents' self-efficacy is expected to enhance their adherence to treatment recommendations, specifically utilization of primary care and self- management, and thus improve children's asthma health outcomes. Results of the trial of this intervention can have broad impact on reducing pediatric health disparities because, if efficacious, this SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention can be extended to other chronic disease contexts where parent- provider communication is important.",Text2Breathe: Enhance Parent Communication to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities,9065943,R01MD007740,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Genetics of lung function and asthma severity in African Americans     DESCRIPTION: Severe, therapy-resistant asthma is a challenging disorder affecting ~10-15% of all asthmatics that is associated with persistent airway inflammation and progressive lung function deficits despite treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Although the mechanisms underlying severe asthma are poorly understood, racial disparities are evident among affected patients and suggest a potential role for genetics in the modulation of the disorder. In the U.S., African Americans are nearly twice as likely (compared to whites) to have current severe asthma independent of socioeconomic status, resulting in a two-fold increase in hospitalizations and a four-fold increase in asthma death. Furthermore, African Americans are twice as likely to have persistent airflow limitation and progressive loss of lung function despite equivalent treatment. However, African Americans have been poorly represented in asthma studies and thus there is an urgent need for research targeting African Americans to unravel the mechanisms and genetic underpinnings of severe asthma in this high-risk population. Although genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cross-sectional lung function measures in asthma patients, these studies were predominantly conducted in general populations of European whites and thus are of questionable relevance to African Americans. Furthermore, the clinical ""utility"" or ""meaningfulness"" of these SNPs in predicting other relevant asthma outcomes in this population remains unclear. Therefore, through a prospective, genotype- stratified cohort study, this application will determine whether SNPs in a panel of lung function genes predict asthma severity in African American children and adults with persistent asthma treated with ICS. The specific aims are to: 1) stratify and phenotype African American children and adults with persistent asthma by genotype 2) determine whether genotype predicts longitudinal asthma severity in African American children and adults with persistent asthma, and 3) refine the gene model for asthma severity in African American children and adults with ancestral genetic markers. Emory and Wake Forest have a long history of collaboration and together have led the initiative for phenotypic and genomic analyses of severe asthma. The findings generated here are expected to generate novel information on the contribution of genomic variants to severe asthma in African Americans. Given the increased morbidity associated with asthma in African Americans, these findings will lay important groundwork to advance personalized genomics approaches for this challenging and understudied population. This study is also in keeping with the mission of the NINR to improve quality of life by managing the symptoms of chronic illnesses (severe asthma) and to enhance research innovation through application of interdisciplinary approaches to improve the health of asthma patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of asthma is significantly greater in African Americans and is highlighted by increased asthma- related hospitalizations and deaths despite equivalent treatment. To understand whether genetic differences underlie racial disparities associated with asthma, we will conduct a prospective, genotype-stratified cohort study to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a panel of genes predicts asthma severity (lung function decline and exacerbations) in African American children and adults with persistent asthma treated with ICS. These findings will generate novel information on the contribution of genomic variants to severe asthma in African Americans and will lay important groundwork to advance personalized medicine for this challenging and understudied population.            ",Genetics of lung function and asthma severity in African Americans,9245570,R01NR013700,"['Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' lumen dilator ', ' Bronchodilators ', ' Bronchial-Dilating Agents ', ' Bronchodilator Agents ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Joints ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Pulmonology ', ' Pulmonary Medicine ', ' Pneumonology ', ' Pneumology ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' forest ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' novel ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' NOTCH4 gene ', ' Oncogene INT3 ', ' NOTCH4 ', ' Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus Integration Site 3 ', ' INT3 ', ' Drosophila Homolog of NOTCH 4 ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Targeted Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' airway epithelium inflammation ', ' airway inflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' gene panel ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' asthmatic ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Genetic study ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genomic effort ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,472176,0.4048564106472622
"Translating an Efficacious Illness Management Intervention for African American Youth with Poorly Controlled Asthma to Real World Settings There is a critical need to develop interventions to reduce barriers to optimal asthma management and reduce the significant risk for asthma-related morbidity experienced by minority children, especially African- American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma. There are few clinical trials focusing on African-American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma, and intervention studies targeting African-American adolescents with asthma in general or African-American children with poorly controlled asthma in particular are characterized by methodological limitations and/or limited effects on objective health outcomes. Multisystemic Therapy-Health Care (MST-HC) is an intensive, multi-component, home-based psychotherapy that targets the multiple causes of poor adolescent asthma management across individual, family and community systems. In a randomized clinical trial, we showed that MST-HC was significantly more effective than home-based family support in improving adherence to controller medications and improving lung functioning among African- American adolescents with moderate to severe, poorly controlled asthma up to six months after the completion of the intervention. In addition, MST-HC reduced asthma-related hospitalizations and associated ED visits. The primary purpose of the proposed study is to adapt MST-HC for use in real world, public healthcare settings and test it in a T3 translational trial. The new intervention, Reach for Control (RFC), will be housed in a pediatric emergency department (ED) at Children's Hospital of Michigan (CHM)and will be adapted for delivery by community health workers (CHWs). The design is an effectiveness-implementation “Hybrid 1” design where the primary aims are to determine the effectiveness of an evidence-based intervention in a real-world setting, and the secondary aims are to gather information about the context for implementation and barriers/ facilitators to implementation. For our effectiveness aim, we will conduct a randomized effectiveness trial with 170 high risk adolescents with poorly controlled asthma seen in the ED for an asthma exacerbation. RFC will be delivered by Wayne Children's Healthcare Access Program, a community agency providing health care services to underserved children in the Detroit area and will be compared to the agency's standard care intervention for youth with poorly controlled asthma. For our implementation aims, we will evaluate the effectiveness of identification, screening and referral to RFC by ED clinical staff via a clinical pathway. We will study barriers and facilitators to the implementation of RFC (both its integration within the ED and delivery by CHWs) using a mixed methods approach. We will also develop and evaluate an efficient and effective method of measuring CHW fidelity to RFC and conduct a cost analysis that will inform decisions such as treatment dose and CHW caseload in future real-world implementations. If successful, the study has the potential to improve quality of life for a vulnerable population while reducing healthcare costs.   There is a critical need to develop and disseminate successful illness management interventions for African American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma. The purpose of the proposed study is to adapt and test an evidence-based intervention for these adolescents for use in real world, pediatric emergency departments (EDs) and evaluate factors affecting intervention implementation.

"Peer-Administered Asthma Self-Management Intervention in Urban Middle Schools Project Summary/Abstract: Health disparities in pediatric asthma persist, with Latino children demonstrating increased asthma morbidity. Middle school children have greater morbidity than children from any other age group, yet there are no school- based asthma management programs developed for this group. To address these gaps, we have developed and piloted a novel group-based intervention: ASMAS (Asthma Self-MAnagement in Schools) in two geographic areas with a high proportion of urban, Latino children with asthma: Providence, Rhode Island, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. ASMAS is a 4-session, peer-facilitated asthma self-management intervention specific to the school setting for Latino middle school (6th-8th graders) children. It is delivered by trained Latino High School Juniors and Seniors with asthma, adapts guidelines-based self-management to the urban school setting, and is consistent with Latino children's cultural backgrounds. In our pilot RCT, ASMAS improved asthma outcomes and self-management for the targeted groups. Our proposed approach involves a hybrid design including a large-scale randomized, controlled trial investigating the effect of ASMAS, and an evaluation of the implementation process to inform future plans to test ASMAS in additional urban settings. Our first aim is to evaluate the effects of ASMAS on asthma health outcomes (e.g., control, symptom free days, absences, lung function) and asthma self-management (skills, knowledge and self-efficacy, availability of rescue inhaler and action plan at school) in a sample of 432 Latino middle school children with asthma in Providence, RI and San Juan, PR (216 per site; 72 per condition). 6th to 8th grade middle schoolers will be enrolled then randomly assigned to 1) ASMAS, or 2) Asthma Education plus Child Health control condition, or 3) a no treatment control condition (9 groups of each condition per site; 8 children per group). Student and primary caregiver assessments will occur at baseline, end of treatment (directly following the intervention), and at three, 4-month post intervention follow-ups. Our second aim is to conduct a mixed-methods, multi-stakeholder process evaluation using the RE-AIM framework,48-50 with students, caregivers, HS Peers, school administrators and additional community stakeholders invested in supporting students' asthma care. We will begin to develop implementation strategies with key stakeholders to better prepare for future large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of ASMAS and its implementation in additional urban centers. Relative to controls, over 1 year, we expect that ASMAS participants will have improved asthma outcomes and self- management. We also expect treatment effects on asthma outcomes will be mediated through changes in self- management in all children, and moderated by acculturative stress and language proficiency in RI children. The proposed work offers a critical opportunity to evaluate ASMAS for improving asthma outcomes for children at high risk on a larger-scale and to develop avenues for sustainability and future dissemination with state and community stakeholders. Project Narrative Health disparities in pediatric asthma persist, with Latino children demonstrating increased asthma morbidity. Middle school children with asthma have greater morbidity than children from any other age group and spend a majority of their day in school, where they must manage any asthma. We developed and piloted a novel group- based intervention - ASMAS (Asthma Self-MAnagement in Schools) in two geographic areas with a high prevalence of urban and Latino children with asthma: Providence, Rhode Island, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. ASMAS is a 4-session, peer-facilitated asthma self-management intervention specific to the school setting for Latino middle school (6th-8th graders) children. It is delivered by trained High School Juniors and Seniors of Latino descent with asthma. We demonstrated the preliminary effects of ASMAS for improving asthma outcomes and self-management relative to controls. In this proposal, we will evaluate ASMAS through a large- scaled Randomized Control Trial with urban middle school students who have persistent asthma in Providence, RI and San Juan, Puerto Rico and we will identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of ASMAS.

"West Philadelphia Asthma Care Implementation Plan Project Summary/Abstract:  The Community Asthma Prevention Program (CAPP) has a two-decade history of utilizing CHWs to improve asthma outcomes of children in Philadelphia. Building on this foundation, we established a network of stakeholders, The West Philadelphia Asthma Care Collaborative (WEPACC), with representation from public housing, healthcare, community, and schools. As a result of assessment of local needs, resource mapping, and months of planning, we designed an asthma care implementation program with the broad objective of integrating home, school, healthcare system, and community for school-aged asthmatic children in West Philadelphia. We will accomplish this goal using CHWs to deliver sustainable patient-centered evidence- based interventions. The evidence-based interventions include (1) a primary care-based Yes We Can intervention with home visitation and (2) a comprehensive and rigorously evaluated school-based intervention, Open Airways for schools and School Based Asthma Therapy. CHWs will function as the hub of each interventions, serving either as primary care CHWs or school CHWs to provide a network of education, care coordination support, and to facilitate communication for families of children with asthma between the four sectors. This project is innovative in that it seeks to integrate interventions in a comprehensive and sustainable manner to reduce asthma disparities in poor, minority children.  Using a factorial design, we will recruit and randomize 600 asthmatic children (ages 6-12 years) from three inner-city primary care clinics who attend one of 23 West Philadelphia schools to one of four study conditions: both interventions (both primary care and school CHWs intervention), primary care CHW or school- CHW alone, or control and follow for one year. We will accomplish the following objectives: Specific Aim 1. Compare effectiveness of the primary care and school interventions to improve asthma control and reduce symptom days using main and simple effects from the factorial design. Specific Aim 2. Explore moderators and mechanisms of effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions. Specific Aim 3. Use mixed methods to explore implementation determinants and outcomes of school intervention that promote effectiveness, fidelity and sustainability Specific Aim 4. Examine the costs, savings, and cost effectiveness associated with the intervention and implementation strategies to promote sustainability 1 Project Narrative: This project uses community health workers or lay health educators to implement asthma interventions that have been proven to work in order to connect the caregiver, community, school and health sectors.

"An Asthma Collaboration to Reduce Childhood Asthma Disparities on the Navajo Nation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Asthma prevalence among children on the Navajo Nation, the largest tribal reservation in the United States, is 2-3 times that of the general population and fueled by health disparities that include devastating poverty, multiple environmental pollutants, and large travel distances to obtain healthcare. Delivery of evidence-based asthma care through the Indian Health Service (IHS), the only healthcare system on the reservation, is inconsistent. While schools and communities identify pediatric asthma as a strong concern, no comprehensive asthma care implementation plan has been previously introduced. Therefore, this proposed study will combine two previously tested programs, one focused on training providers and one on school-based education and monitoring, to build a comprehensive, integrated, team-based Asthma Care Implementation Program to address medical care, family, home, and community to improve the health of Navajo children with asthma. A one-year engagement phase has resulted in strong support from Navajo Nation organizations including the President and Vice President of the Navajo Nation, governmental organizations, healthcare centers, schools, and communities in the three participating agencies (Fort Defiance, Chinle, and Tuba City). Approval of the proposed study by the Navajo Nation Human Research Review Board has been obtained. Key recommendations from communities including use of existing resources such as the Navajo Epidemiology Center, Navajo Health Department, local media, lay health workers, and ongoing involvement of stakeholders are included in this plan. Using a stepped-wedge design, the intervention will be introduced sequentially into three agencies. A mixed-methods analysis strategy will be employed that includes annual examination of asthma exacerbations through the IHS database (primary outcome), interviews with 300 families with a child with asthma, and key informant interviews with healthcare providers and school teachers and nurses. During the sustainability phase, meetings will be held with multiple organizations including local chapter houses to share outcome data, gather feedback, and plan for future dissemination to other agencies and reservations. The RE-AIM framework will be employed to evaluate the implementation process and facilitate dissemination to other tribal populations.

"Gene-Environment Analyses of Early Life Exposures and Asthma in Ethnically Diverse Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a multifactorial disease with environmental and genetic contributions. We demonstrated that the harm caused by early-life exposures to air pollution and tobacco varies among different racial/ethnic groups. Our recent genome-wide association studies have identified both shared and ethnic-specific genetic risk factors for asthma and asthma-related traits. Our findings imply that both genes and early-life environmental exposures are important contributors to asthma susceptibility in minority children. We hypothesize that racial/ethnic differences in asthma susceptibility are due to gene-environment interactions resulting from early-life exposure to air pollution and tobacco. We will use existing genome-wide SNP genotypes and two distinct but complimentary approaches-admixture mapping and novel genome-wide GxE interaction scanning methods-to investigate the relationship between genetics, early-life air pollution and tobacco smoke exposures, and asthma risk. Specific Aim 1: Ancestry by environment interaction analysis of asthma in minority children. We will use genome-wide estimates of local chromosomal ancestry (African, European, and Native American) to perform an admixture mapping by environment (AxE) scan in 6,536 Latino and African American children from across the U.S. We will fine map AxE interaction peaks by performing targeted GxE analyses of genotyped and imputed SNPs from CAAPA and the Thousand Genomes Project. Results will be replicated using similar outcomes and exposures in the Mexico City Childhood Asthma Study (MCCAS). Specific Aim 2: Genome-wide by environment (GxE) interaction analysis of asthma in ethnically diverse children with and without asthma. We will use a novel two-step analytical method to perform a genome-wide scan at 38.9 million SNPs for GxE interactions with air pollution and tobacco smoke exposure. Scans will be performed in our combined resource of 8,138 children, as well as within Latino, European, and African American subgroups. Results will be replicated using similar outcomes and exposures in MCCAS. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We will identify genes and genetic loci whereby gene-environment interactions play an important role in asthma etiology, and thus retrieve part of the missing heritability of asthma. We will identify significant shared and ethnic specific gene-environment interactions, which will further our understanding of racial/ethnic differences in asthma susceptibility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic and early-life environmental exposures are important contributors of asthma risk. Some racial/ethnic groups are more susceptible than others to developing asthma following early-life exposure to air pollution and tobacco smoke.

"SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The proliferation of smartphones and sensors has made continuous monitoring of physiology, environment, and public health notifications possible. However, personalized digital health and patient empowerment will become reality only if massive multisensory and multimodal observational data is processed within patient context and made actionable to enable early detection; better diagnosis, effective prevention and treatment of the disease; and improve the quality of life. This research will be performed in the context of asthma, which affects 300 million people and claims over 250,000 lives worldwide annually. According to CDC, 9.3% of US children have asthma. Understanding asthma and its management is challenging; it is a multifactorial disease with subjective causes and symptoms, and extant diagnosis and treatment guidelines can be improved using evidence-based action recommendation. With the advent of mobile and connected sensors, timely information about asthma triggers has become available, and its exploitation requires precisely understanding and quantifying the sensed data's role for preventive and proactive assessment of asthma. In this application led by computer scientists and a practicing clinician, we address the central problem of deriving actionable information from data monitored using kHealth technology. Through a pilot study, we have tested our kHealth kit equipped on several pediatric patients under the guidance of a clinical doctor for reliable data collection and patient operation, with promising initial results. We build on this foundation by addressing the problem of semantic representation, integration, abstraction, and personalized interpretation of heterogeneous observations spanning physiological, environmental data, and online data in the context of medical knowledge. Our primary hypothesis is that an evidence-based approach to asthma can help doctors determine more precisely the cause, severity and control of asthma, and can alert patients to seek timely clinical assistance to better manage asthma. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This application direclty relates to NICHD mission of improving health of children, with focus on asthma that affects a significant population. The kHealth system uses multiple sensors, mobile application and intelligent, personalized processing to predict health risks associated with asthma in children to develop a preventative and proactive approach to asthma management.",SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care,9294106,R01HD087132,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Ventolin ', ' Salbutamol ',

"nmMLCK Contributes to Genetic and Environmental Asthma Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe asthma represents ~10% of all asthma but carries a significantly greater mortality risk especially for African descent (AD) individuals. Environmental factors (such as exposure to particulate matter air pollution or PM) and genetic factors are likely critical to defining susceptibility to severe asthma and provide insights into tis area of serious health disparity. In this regard, the non-muscle isoform of myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK), encoded by MYLK, actively participates in the pathogenesis of vascular barrier disruption and lung inflammatory cell trafficking, each an essential contributor to asthmatic inflammation. In lung endothelial cells (EC), nmMLCK is a multifunctional cytoskeletal mediator central to regulation of EC actin cytoskeletal rearrangement via phosphorylation of myosin light chains (MLCs). Our previous studies further identified that African ancestry is associated with asthma risk with coding and non- coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding nmMLCK, MYLK, over-represented in AD individuals strongly associated with severe asthma. This R01 renewal will characterize the pathobiological functions of MYLK SNPs associated with severe asthma in under-represented minority backgrounds, thereby directly addressing an important health disparity. To address our hypothesis that nmMLCK expression and functional activity (inflammatory regulation) are dysregulated in severe asthma & influenced by SNPs enriched in AD populations, Specific Aim #1 will evaluate MYLK SNPs found in non-hispanic caucasians, Latino & African descent children and adult populations for association with severe asthma. We will conduct mid-throughput genotyping studies in ~4000 asthma patients (European descent, African descent, Latino Puerto Rican, and Latino Mexican)and identify severe asthma-related SNPs. Specific Aim #2 will characterize the effects of severe asthma-associated SNPs and Paticulate Matter (PM) exposure on nmMLCK mRNA expression and function via effects on MYLK 5'UTR promoter activity, 3'UTR binding activity to miRNAs, promoter CpG island methylation, and mRNA secondary structure. Specific Aim #3 will functionally analyze effects of severe asthma-associated MYLK coding SNPs on nmMLCK protein structure and function (kinase activity, protein binding, and lamellipodial dynamics). Finally, Specific Aim #4 will validate these severe asthma-associated SNPs in vivo, and evaluate novel nmMLCK inhibitors designed to diminish PM-exacerbated asthmatic inflammatory lung injury. Supported by compelling published and preliminary data, we believe these integrated translational studies will lead to mechanistic insights into asthma pathobiology and the health disparity of severe asthma while facilitating the development of novel, potentially population-specific, inflammation-reducing therapies for asthma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Severe asthma, representing ~10% of all asthma, carries a significantly greater mortality and is a key area of serious health disparity with Americans of African descent experiencing greater asthma mortality compared to individuals of European descent. Environmental factors (such as exposure to particulate matter air pollution) and genetic factors in genes such as MYLK may prove to be critical to defining the susceptibility to severe asthma.

"The role of ovarian hormones on allergen-mediatedd innate immune airway responses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma prevalence is greater in boys than girls, but around puberty there is a shift in asthma prevalence, and at mid-life women are about two times more likely than men to have asthma. This suggests a role for sex hormones in asthma pathogenesis; however the mechanisms remain unknown. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are important in driving the initial phase of allergic airway inflammation that is associated with asthma. ILC2 are activated by IL-33, TSLP, and IL-25 which are upregulated in response to airway allergens, including Alternaria alternata. Upon stimulation, ILC2 have increased expression of the transcription factors GATA3 and RORα and produce IL-5 and IL-13. IL-5 and IL-13 increase the infiltration of eosinophils, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and mucus production, all hallmarks of asthma. Our preliminary data showed IL- 33-stimulated ILC2 from female mice had significantly increased IL-5 and IL-13 protein expression compared to ILC2 from male mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that the ovarian hormones, 17beta-estradiol (17β-E2) and progesterone (P4), increase ILC2-induced airway inflammation. In Aim 1 we will determine the mechanisms by which sex hormones increase IL-5 and IL-13 production from ILC2. Sham-operated female and male mice, ovariectomized female mice, and orchidectomized male mice will be administered pellets containing vehicle, 17β-E2, P4, and/or testosterone. ILCs will be harvested from the bone marrow and lungs of these mice and stimulated with IL-33 ex vivo. IL-5 and IL-13 protein expression, RORα and GATA3 mRNA expression, and surface expression of ST2, a component of the IL-33 receptor, will then be determined in ILC2. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of ovarian hormones on Alternaria extract (Alt Ex)-induced innate immune-mediated airway inflammation. WT BALB/c female, male, ovariectomized, and orchidectomized mice will be challenged with Alt Ex for 4 days to initiate an innate immune response. We will then determine ILC2 cytokine expression, airway inflammation, AHR, and mucus production. This proposal will delineate a mechanism(s) by which sex hormones regulate ILC2, and it may identify potential therapeutic targets for patients, in particular women, with asthma.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will determine how the sex hormones affect protein secretion from group 2 innate immune lymphoid cells that are associated with increased airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and mucus production seen in asthma. Our findings will determine if sex hormones differentially regulate ILC2 cytokine expression and may determine potential therapeutic targets to for patients, in particular women, with asthma.

"Pediatric Asthma Disparities: The Role of Sleep and Immune Balance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K24 application proposes a mentorship program in patient-oriented research in multi-level contributors to pediatric asthma health disparities, wih a focus on sleep and immune balance. The K24 Candidate is an Associate Professor (Research) in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior of the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, with a history of funding in behavioral interventions and longitudinal research aimed at improving asthma outcomes in urban children and addressing health disparities in pediatric asthma. Training Plan: The candidate will obtain additional training in asthma clinical immunology and sleep physiology, including state-of the art methods to assess immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep, and in-lab methods to assess sleep phenomenology through experimental approaches. Research Plan: The research proposed involves an innovative investigation of the effects of experimental sleep disruption on immune balance (Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio-Th1/Th2R; plasma IL-6 -pIL-6), and associated changes in asthma- related lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) and daytime performance in urban children with persistent asthma (8-10 years old). Forty children and their primary caregiver will each participate in a within-subjects protocol, with two experimental sleep conditions: baseline sleep (1 overnight, in-lab polysomnographic (PSG) sleep study), followed by sleep fragmentation (1 overnight, in-lab PSG). Prior to each condition, children will follow a 6-day sleep stabilization schedule at home. We will monitor sleep and lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) daily to confirm eligibility and adherence to sleep criteria, and assess asthma status. We include assessments of immune biomarkers and daytime performance following each condition. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentoring Plan: The proposed mentoring plan offers opportunities for mentorship of postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty with interests in POR. Mentees will be involved in ongoing longitudinal and intervention studies on pediatric asthma disparities, including the proposed research, which will focus on biological-based processes that contribute to asthma and sleep in urban children. A strong emphasis is placed on the recruitment and selection of minority mentees. This overall plan capitalizes on the rich resources and training opportunities available to postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty at Brown Medical School, including several T32 fellowship programs, numerous junior faculty with K awards and small grants, a commitment to diversity in training, seminars in research design, ethics, and statistics, and an established infrastructure for evaluation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pediatric health disparities in the area of asthma and sleep continue to exist. Urban poverty and poorly controlled asthma can both adversely impact sleep quality by disrupting the continuity of nighttime sleep. Increased asthma symptoms and sleep disruption have each been linked with changes in immune balance. The immune imbalance associated with asthma in children may be greater in the context of sleep disruption, and this may adversely impact daytime functioning and increase inflammation that can bring on asthma symptoms. This K24 application will provide mentorship in patient-oriented research to post-doctoral fellows, residents, and junior faculty interested in multi-level contributing factors to disparities in pediatric asthma. The research proposed involves the implementation of an experimental approach to examine the effects of sleep disruption on immune imbalance, asthma-related lung function, and daytime performance in urban children (ages 8-10) with persistent, allergic asthma. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentorship goals involve providing training to post-doctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty, particularly those from minority backgrounds, in patient-oriented research focused on pediatric health disparities. The proposed career training activities to enhance knowledge and assessment of asthma clinical immunology and sleep physiology, will allow for more broadened opportunities for mentorship to trainees.

"Ancestry-Environmental Exposure Interactions and Asthma Risk in Admixed Population Project Summary/Abstract The burden of asthma is disproportionately high among minority children, in particular children of African descent. African American (AA) children are four times more likely to be hospitalized and seven times more likely to die from asthma than non-AAs. Recent studies have identified genetic and environmental exposure factors that contribute to asthma risk; however, the extent to which these factors interact to explain a person’s risk to asthma remains largely unknown. Our long-term goal is to develop a program of study that would lead to an in-depth understanding of the complex interplay between genetic and non-genetic causes of asthma among AA children, and establish the utility of this information to reduce and predict asthma risk in children. The objective of this study is to investigate the interactions between genetic ancestry and environmental exposure risk factors contributing to asthma risk in AA children using a well characterized cohort with banked DNA samples, environmental exposure and clinical data as well as ancestry informative markers. We hypothesize that genetic variants with large allele frequency differences and variation in environmental exposures between African and European ancestry may be partly responsible for the current difference in asthma risk in African American admixed ancestry. Moreover, ancestry and environmental exposure may jointly influence the variation and development of asthma. Two Specific Aims are proposed to test our hypothesis and achieve our proposed plan: Aim 1) Determine local and global genetic ancestry in AA asthmatic children using ancestry informative markers (AIMs); and Aim 2) Identify interactions between local ancestry and environmental exposure risk factors. The proposed study is highly significant (it addresses a major public health issue given the high burden of asthma among minority children) and highly innovative (it dissects the genetic and non- genetic causes of asthma disparities using ancestry mapping). Ultimately, this research may provide the link and insight between asthma and genetic and non-genetic factors and has potential avenues for intervention. Success in this R03 application will provide key knowledge and data to apply for fundable R01 grant application related to racial disparities in childhood asthma. We therefore believe that this pilot study along with future studies will uncover fundamental information about whether genetic factors and selected environmental exposure factors as well as their interactions can affect asthma risk and prediction, thereby reducing the burden of asthma on patients and their families and improving their quality of life. 1 Project Narrative Despite advances in asthma care, African American (AA) are 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 7 times more likely to die from asthma than non-AAs; it is unclear whether this disparity solely represents differences in environmental exposure (e.g., traffic, mold), genetic predisposition, or a combination of the two. In this pilot study, we will determine the role of ancestry variation and its interaction with environmental exposure factors in modulating asthma risk. Our long-term goal is to develop a program of study that would lead to an in-depth understanding of the complex interplay between genetic and non-genetic causes of asthma, and establish the utility of this information to reduce and predict asthma risk in children.",Ancestry-Environmental Exposure Interactions and Asthma Risk in Admixed Population,9338301,R03HL133713,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Allergens ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Funding ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Molds ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Tobacco smoke ', ' Clinic ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Sampling ', ' DNA Library ', ' DNA bank ', ' repository ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' asthmatic ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' study population ', ' minority children ', ' ']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R03,2017,78000,0.3469470813602109
"Rhode Island Asthma Integrated Response Program (RI-AIR) Project Summary/Abstract: Greater Providence, Rhode Island is comprised of several urban “core” cities of high poverty and significant pediatric asthma disparity. The RI-Asthma Integrated Response (RI-AIR) Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP) is a comprehensive system of identification, screening and intervention for pediatric asthma. Core components include: a 1) state of the art technology platform (the RI-AIR information data system, or RI-AIR IDS) to integrate data from LifeChart (EHR), REDCap (research data system), and KIDSNet (state-based database of child health information), 2) algorithm for stratification of asthma management services based on level of asthma control/risk, 3) multilevel school-based education (CASE) to family/child/school system for children whose asthma is not well-controlled, 4) intensive home-based intervention (HARP) for children with poorly controlled asthma, and 5) enhanced coordination between caregiver, school nurse, and health care provider to promote integration across sectors of care. The first aim of the proposed work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the RI-AIR ACIP using a randomized, stepped wedge design. During Years 2-4, we will provide our intervention sequentially to sixteen high-risk communities involving approximately 1500 urban, ethnically diverse children (aged 2-12) with asthma and their families. We will evaluate both individual-level (e.g., asthma control) and community-specific outcomes (i.e., rates of ED a multi-level process evaluation of the RI-AIR ACIP during implementation (Years 2-5). We will assess penetration within identified communities and school districts, and evaluate characteristics of families that accept and complete the intervention vs. those who do not. We will determine fidelity of the RI-AIR IDS technology platform in assigning interventions according to asthma control/risk, and treatment fidelity and dose delivered of the HARP and CASE programs. We will use focus groups and provider surveys to determine facilitators of and barriers to visits) for children with asthma. The second aim of this application involves conducting effective implementation. The third aim involves conducting a mixed-methods evaluation of the sustainability of the RI-AIR ACIP, with ongoing input from our community stakeholders during Years 5-6. We define sustainability as continued capacity, continued activities, and continued benefits. We expect over 1 year, participants receiving the RI-AIR ACIP will have improved asthma control and fewer symptom free days relative to baseline. We expect over 1 year, relative to baseline, caregivers will have improved asthma knowledge, self-efficacy, asthma QOL, and indicators of effective disease management. We expect over 1 year, communities receiving the RI-AIR ACIP will have reduced ED visits and hospitalizations relative to their baseline year, and relative to targeted communities that have not yet received RI-AIR. We plan to demonstrate that RI-AIR ACIP is a replicable, evidence-based and cost-saving model that improves asthma outcomes for children at most risk, and can be disseminated to other urban communities to address asthma disparities. Project Narrative Pediatric asthma is a significant public health problem. Striking asthma disparities continue despite available clinical guidelines to manage asthma in home and school settings. There is a crucial need for coordinated systems of asthma care. This proposal will evaluate the effectiveness of the RI-Asthma Integrated Response (RI-AIR) Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP), a comprehensive system of identification, screening and intervention for pediatric asthma, targeted toward high-risk communities in greater Providence, RI. The RI- AIR ACIP is based on home and school interventions for pediatric asthma that have established efficacy, with input from the RI-AIR Collaborative, an established group of key stakeholders involved in the care of children with asthma in the state. The end-products of this project will be a sustainable, disseminable intervention model to address asthma management barriers to children at highest risk for poor disease outcomes.",Rhode Island Asthma Integrated Response Program (RI-AIR),9386479,U01HL138677,"['Algorithms ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Inhalators ', ' Inhaler ', ' Insurance ', ' Investments ', ' Methods ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Poverty ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Cost Savings ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Stratification ', ' Process ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' school district ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ']",NHLBI,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,U01,2017,826281,0.482616978940731
"A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention for Rural Latino Children K23 Abstract A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention  for Rural Latino Children DESCRIPTION: Rural Latino children with asthma suffer high rates of uncontrolled asthma symptoms, emergency department visits, and repeat hospitalizations. This vulnerable population must negotiate micro and macro level challenges that impact asthma management, including language barriers, primary care access, parental time off from work, insurance coverage, distance from specialty sites, and documentation status. There are few proven interventions that address asthma management embedded within this unique context. Using a bio-ecological approach, we will determine the feasibility of a patient-centered collaborative program between rural Latino children with asthma and their families, school based nursing, and primary care providers, facilitated by the use of a smart phone based mobile application (mobile app) with a Spanish-language interface. We hypothesize that improving communication through a collaborative, patient-centered intervention will improve asthma management, empower the patient and family, decrease outcome disparities, and decrease direct and indirect costs. The specific aims of this study include: 1) Produce and validate a Spanish translation of an existing asthma management app and evaluate its usability with Latino parents of children with asthma; 2) Develop and evaluate a triadic, patient-centered asthma intervention preliminary protocol, facilitated by the bilingual mobile app validated in aim 1; and 3) Investigate the feasibility of the patient-centered asthma intervention from aim 2 using a wait list randomized control trial (RCT) to investigate the effects of the intervention on school days missed and medication adherence. The results of this study will be used to support a full scale randomized control trial R01 grant application in Year 4 of this award. The career development award will provide Dr. Estrada the mentoring and training needed to develop knowledge and skills in rural asthma disparities research, intervention development and program evaluation, and integration of technology- based interventions. At the close of the award, she will be positioned to design, implement, and evaluate research that will significantly impact rural asthma disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is growing evidence that rural asthma rates are similar to urban asthma rates, yet prior research has focused on urban population groups and interventions. Additionally, rural Latino children with asthma have unique challenges and barriers that contribute to health outcomes disparities. The findings from the proposed research will support the development of a targeted and cost-effective intervention that may improve asthma outcomes in this vulnerable population group.",A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention for Rural Latino Children,9385900,K23HL133596,"['Affect ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Award ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Language ', ' Mentors ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' South Carolina ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Transportation ', ' Urban Population ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Population Group ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Population Intervention ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Indirect Costs ', ' Facilities and Administrative Costs ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' Home visitation ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' usability ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,K23,2017,145657,0.4020677342516417
"Spatio-temporal models of allegenic pollen for human exposure and health investigations 4.4.7: Project Summary Pollen allergies afflict over 35 million Americans, and the economic cost of treating these allergies exceeds 12 billion dollars annually. The effects on human health are considerable because pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing asthma and can trigger fatal asthma attacks. Despite the importance of these public health concerns, urban areas are filled with plants that produce allergenic pollen, many of which are intentionally cultivated. This preventable situation is caused by a lack of knowledge concerning: 1) how pollen production and dispersal from individual plants leads to heterogeneity in airborne allergenic pollen concentrations on small spatial scales (e.g., tens to hundreds of meters); and 2) the extent to which exposure to allergenic pollen is responsible for triggering asthma attacks and other respiratory symptoms. This project's objective is to quantify these processes and show how allergenic pollen producing plants affect human health. The main components of this research include: • Characterizing pollen production and spatial dispersal patterns using a pollen sampling  field study focused on Norway maple (Acer platanoides), white mulberry (Morus alba),  box elder (Acer negundo), and common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia); • Creating a spatially explicit model of airborne pollen concentrations as a function of  plant composition using a comprehensive street tree database; • Adding a temporal dimension to the spatial pollen count predictions using  meteorological data, daily pollen count data from a National Allergy Bureau pollen  counting station, and a small citizen science plant phenology monitoring program; and • Linking pollen exposure to health effects including asthma attacks and respiratory  symptoms, using existing datasets collected in the study area, Detroit, MI. These include  respiratory related hospital visits extracted from geocoded Medicaid claims data and  cohort studies that tracked 255 children's respiratory health for >12 months. Understanding the contribution of particular plants to pollen concentrations in urban areas has will allow land owners, municipalities and others to actively manage plant composition to reduce allergenic pollen exposure and its health effects. These translational benefits are especially important in both highly vegetated and ""shrinking"" cities, such as Detroit, where large vacant areas are providing habitat for allergenic plants that likely exacerbate health disparities. 4.4.8: Project narrative Allergenic pollen triggers asthma attacks and causes severe allergic reactions, but little is known about how much airborne pollen particular people are exposed to. This study will quantify allergenic pollen production and dispersal in an urban area, estimate where and when pollen concentrations are high, and test how exposure affects respiratory disease.",Spatio-temporal models of allegenic pollen for human exposure and health investigations,9404513,F32ES026477,"['Trees ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' pulmonary function ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Morus ', ' Mulberry ', ' Acer ', ' Maple ', ' Ambrosia ', ' Ragweed ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' meter ', ' respiratory ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Municipalities ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' Acer negundo ', ' Box Elder ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' land use ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Habitats ', ' case control ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Plant Sources ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Allergic Reaction ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' exposed human population ', ' human exposure ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' respiratory health ', ' citizen science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' minority communities ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Medicaid ', ' Meteorology ', ' Norway ', ' Plants ', ' Pollen ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' airway symptom ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2017,1800,0.27855278148007767
"Mechanisms of IL-17A-mediated enhancement of asthma severity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lung that currently afflicts more than 300 million people worldwide. While asthma is mediated by an excessive Th2 immune response to allergens, recent evidence suggests that production of the Th17 cytokine, IL-17A, is associated with the development of more severe disease. While severe asthmatics are at greatest risk for morbidity or death following acute exacerbations, and can be refractory to therapies that are highly effective in individuals with mild disease, the molecular mechanisms whereby IL-17A contributes to the development of severe allergic asthma are ill-defined. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A facilitates severe asthma would provide additional therapeutic targets for populations underserved by current therapies. Using a mouse model we provide evidence that severe asthma is associated with increased IL-17A production, and is compounded by enhanced Il17ra expression and elevated responsiveness to IL-17A. These alterations in IL-17A production and responsiveness exacerbate IL-13-driven STAT6 activation, gene expression, and airway responses. Our preliminary data suggests that IL-17A-mediated enhancement of IL-13-driven responses occur through two, non-mutually independent mechanisms in mouse cells; 1) by causing the dissociation of a complex including IL-13R�1 and TRAF3, which normally limits IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation, and 2) by activating transcription factors (NF-�B, C/EBP� and C/EBP�) which can enhance IL-13/STAT6 driven gene expression. While preliminary studies presented here also suggest that similar mechanisms may operate in human cell lines, the extent to which the observations made in our mouse model apply to humans with severe asthma is unclear. Three specific aims are proposed to identify the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A enhances asthma severity in mice, and humans. Specific Aim 1 will determine if the increased IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation and AHR observed in the presence of IL-17A is the result of the dissociation of the IL- 13R�1:TRAF3 complex following initiation of IL-17A signaling. Specific Aim 2 will dissect the importance of IL- 17A-driven activation of NF-�B (canonical versus non-canonical), C/EBP� and C/EBP� in IL-13/IL-17A synergy in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will directly test whether similar synergistic interactions between IL-13 and IL-17A are observed in asthma relevant, primary human cells. Additionally, we will determine whether severe asthma in children is associated, as it is in the mouse, with increased IL-17A production, IL17RA expression, and IL-17A responsiveness. Collectively, the studies proposed in this application will move us beyond the ""Th2 paradigm"" of allergic asthma, begin to characterize the mechanisms whereby Th17-products trigger the development of severe allergic asthma, and determine whether similar mechanisms may be at play in mice and humans. A better understanding of these mechanisms will enable us to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions in individuals with severe asthma, a population underserved by current therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Elevated IL-17A levels have been linked to the development of severe asthma in humans, a debilitating, treatment-resistant form of allergic asthma that accounts for the majority of asthma-related mortality and morbidity.

"A Patient Advocate to improve real-world asthma management for inner city adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Few interventions to improve asthma management have targeted low-income minority adults and even fewer have focused on the real-world practice where care is provided for these patients. We adapted a patient navigator, here called a Patient Advocate (PA), a term preferred by patients, as a means of facilitating and maintaining access to chronic care for adults with moderate or severe asthma and prevalent chronic morbidities recruited from clinics serving low-income urban neighborhoods. The intervention, informed by focus groups of patients and providers, activates and empowers both groups, integrating activities with proven efficacy. Its feasibility and acceptability were demonstrated in RC1 HL099612 this project, implemented in a variety of practices, tests its comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness. Our PA coaches, models, and assists with preparations for a visit with the asthma doctor attends the visit with permission of participant and provider and confirms understanding. The PA facilitates scheduling, obtaining insurance coverage, overcoming patients' unique social and administrative barriers to carrying out medical advice, and transfer of information between providers and patients. PA activities are individualized, multimodal, take account of  comorbidities, and are generalizable to other chronic diseases. The PAs, highly valued by patients in RC1HL099612, are recent college graduates interested in health-related or education careers, research experience, working with patients, and generally having the same race/ethnicity distribution as potential  subjects.   We will enroll 300 adults wit moderate-severe asthma into a randomized clinical trial testing whether the  PA intervention, compared to usual care, is associated with better and sustained asthma control (Specific Aim  1) and other asthma outcomes (prednisone bursts, ED visits, hospitalizations, quality of life, FEV1) (Specific  Aim 2) relative to baseline. Secondary aims will assess mediators and moderators of the PA-asthma outcome relationship. Specific Aim 3 evaluates the intervention's cost-effectiveness. We will explore intervention's impact on providers in post-study focus groups. This proposal is innovative and significant because it 1) compares the effectiveness of  the PA to usual  care, 2) focuses on inner-city low-income predominantly minority adults who experience high asthma morbidity,  3) uses a real-world behavioral intervention tested for sustainability in an RCT design, 4) tests a multi-faceted  individualized intervention which considers comorbidities as it provides a model of chronic asthma  management and is thus generalizable to patients with other chronic diseases and comorbidities, 5) examines  patient-provider communication, 6) uses a unique PA, 7) considers both English- and Spanish-speaking  patients, and 8) assesses the cost-effectiveness of the intervention relative to UC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Few interventions to improve asthma management have targeted low-income minority asthmatic adults and even fewer have focused on the real-world practice where care is provided for these patients.

"Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication and Social Adversity (ASTHMA) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Pediatric asthma has a substantial public health burden with numerous contributing risk factors in the physical, social, and health care environments. This burden is elevated among low-income minority children living in urban areas, related in part to multi-factorial residential exposures. There are numerous complex feedback loops among risk factors, with interventions potentially inducing behavioral responses that modify levels of other risk factors. Given these characteristics, pediatric asthma is an ideal candidate for systems science tools to prioritize among risk factors and design intervention strategies. However, there have been few applications of systems science techniques to asthma, and no applications to date that take account of multiple risk factors with housing, social and behavioral components. Discrete event simulation (DES), a systems science approach that involves modeling a complex system in which individuals can be tracked over time, multiple attributes can be incorporated simultaneously, and interactions and non-linear effects can be incorporated, is ideally suited for this application. This project (the Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication, and Social Adversity - ASTHMA) builds upon the only DES model of pediatric asthma or the physical environment, leveraging data from a longstanding electronic health record (EHR) database, and extensive neighborhood contextual data available from a BU center of environmental health disparities. Building on prior expertise and the strength of an established interdisciplinary team we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: To build the Boston Children’s Healthcare Disparities Repository (BCHDR), a large database of predominantly low-income and racial/ethnic minority asthmatic children extracted from the BMC EHR, and use it to develop associations among key predictors of lung function, medication prescription and adherence, social adversity, asthma outcomes, and healthcare utilization. Aim 2: To predict exposure to indoor pollutants and environmental conditions across a range of housing types, resident behaviors, and sociodemographic characteristics, in a manner useful for DES modeling. Aim 3: To expand the existing DES model to capture the variability in housing, sociodemographic, and neighborhood environments for asthmatic children in the BCHDR, and evaluate the influence of implemented or proposed policies addressing housing conditions, medication adherence, and aspects of social adversity on asthma outcomes. These data and methods collectively allow us to develop unique insights about the individual and cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on asthma outcomes, as well as about how candidate interventions would influence asthma outcomes given the multiple pathways and complex behavioral responses. While we focus on data specific to Boston to ensure internal consistency, our methods and insights will generalize to other urban settings, our housing modeling approach can be expanded to any are in the US, and our discrete event simulation code and methodology for extracting and analyzing clinical and social risk factor data from an EHR could be adapted to other circumstances. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication, and Social Adversity (ASTHMA) will yield a simulation model that can characterize the effects of indoor environmental exposures, social risk factors, medication adherence, and neighborhood contextual factors on asthma outcomes among low-income children. ASTHMA will incorporate indoor air quality models, building simulations, statistical models using medical and social adversity data from electronic health records, and GIS derived neighborhood contextual variables, with sufficient data to characterize feedback loops and interactions among risk factors. We will develop insight about how candidate interventions – related to housing construction and management, community, individual, and public housing policies – in low-income housing can influence chemical exposures, social stressors, and corresponding health outcomes.","Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication and Social Adversity (ASTHMA)",9286518,R01ES027816,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' Boston ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Crime ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' Humidity ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' Publishing ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Ventilation ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Measures ', ' Indoor Air Quality ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' stressor ', ' pollutant ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Published Database ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Department of Energy ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' community intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' intervention effect ', ' simulation software ', ' Indoor pollutant ', ' asthmatic ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' model building ', ' minority children ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' fine particles ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' PM2.5 ', ' data resource ', ' urban setting ', ' ']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,553972,0.30352371910305587
"School-Based Asthma Care for Teens (SB-ACT) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood, and despite current advances in therapies, morbidity and mortality continue to increase. Low-income, minority teenagers have disproportionately high rates of asthma morbidity, including excess risk of emergency department care, hospitalization, and death from asthma, compared to white adolescents. Although urban children suffer the largest burden from asthma, they are the least likely group to receive adequate preventive care, and poor adherence plays a significant contributing role in asthma morbidity. Inner city adolescents with asthma are at particular risk of nonadherence.  Thus, there is a substantial amount of suffering that could be prevented with improvements in care. This application builds on our extensive experience with efficacious school-based programs for urban children and teens with asthma. The overall goal is to broadly disseminate a novel system of asthma care throughout the entire city school district ('School Based Asthma Care for Teens'; SBACT), and test its effectiveness in improving adherence and reducing morbidity among urban teens.  The SB-ACT intervention includes two core components. First, adolescents visit the school nurse daily for 6-8 weeks at the start of the school year to receive a trial of directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medications. The goal is for the teen to establish a relationship with the nurse, learn proper medication technique, and experience the benefits and value of daily preventive therapy. Four to 6 weeks after the initiation of DOT, the teen will receive a motivational interviewing (MI) counseling program designed to  enhance the teen's motivation to transition to independent, sustained preventive medication use. We will train community-based nurses affiliated with the local American Lung Association to deliver the MI component. The MI nurse will conduct three counseling sessions with the teen at school, which are designed to capitalize on the teen's experience with DOT and the potential benefits they experienced. Given the complex nature of  asthma care in this population, we plan to evaluate this intervention using a 3-group design in which 430 teens  will be randomly assigned to either; 1) the SB-ACT program (trial of DOT for 6-8 weeks + 3 MI counseling  sessions); 2) DOT-only (DOT only for 6-8 weeks); or 3) an asthma education (AE) comparison group (in-school  asthma education delivered by a trained asthma educator). We include the DOT-only group to evaluate whether this component alone is sufficient to promote sustained adherence without counseling. The AE group is designed to enhance asthma care and control for the attention received in MI counseling. We will assess the effectiveness of the SB-ACT intervention in reducing asthma morbidity, perform an economic sustainability analysis, and evaluate each component of program implementation with a focus on sustainability and dissemination. At the completion of the study, the effectiveness of this system of school-based asthma care will be better defined as a sustainable means to improve care for adolescents and reduce health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urban adolescents with asthma suffer from substantial morbidity and suboptimal preventive care. This project may have a profound impact on public health because it proposes the implementation of an innovative, efficacious intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines throughout an entire urban school district. Built upon our extensive prior work in the city schools, this program has the potential t serve as a sustainable model to improve asthma care for this understudied population and reduce health disparities.",School-Based Asthma Care for Teens (SB-ACT),9281862,R18HL116244,"['Absenteeism ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Belief ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nurses ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Nursing Schools ', ' Nurse Training Schools ', ' Secondary Schools ', ' secondary education ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' satisfaction ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Guideline Adherence ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' age group ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Modeling ', ' Directly Observed Therapy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' American Lung Association ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' ER care ', ' ED care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' post intervention ', ' comparison group ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' chronic care model ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' demographics ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' arm ', ' Therapy trial ', ' attentional control ', ' school district ', ' improved outcome ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' urban children ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' urban school ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R18,2017,711956,0.41219125723709243
"Mechanisms of IL-17A-mediated enhancement of asthma severity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lung that currently afflicts more than 300 million people worldwide. While asthma is mediated by an excessive Th2 immune response to allergens, recent evidence suggests that production of the Th17 cytokine, IL-17A, is associated with the development of more severe disease. While severe asthmatics are at greatest risk for morbidity or death following acute exacerbations, and can be refractory to therapies that are highly effective in individuals with mild disease, the molecular mechanisms whereby IL-17A contributes to the development of severe allergic asthma are ill-defined. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A facilitates severe asthma would provide additional therapeutic targets for populations underserved by current therapies. Using a mouse model we provide evidence that severe asthma is associated with increased IL-17A production, and is compounded by enhanced Il17ra expression and elevated responsiveness to IL-17A. These alterations in IL-17A production and responsiveness exacerbate IL-13-driven STAT6 activation, gene expression, and airway responses. Our preliminary data suggests that IL-17A-mediated enhancement of IL-13-driven responses occur through two, non-mutually independent mechanisms in mouse cells; 1) by causing the dissociation of a complex including IL-13R�1 and TRAF3, which normally limits IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation, and 2) by activating transcription factors (NF-�B, C/EBP� and C/EBP�) which can enhance IL-13/STAT6 driven gene expression. While preliminary studies presented here also suggest that similar mechanisms may operate in human cell lines, the extent to which the observations made in our mouse model apply to humans with severe asthma is unclear. Three specific aims are proposed to identify the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A enhances asthma severity in mice, and humans. Specific Aim 1 will determine if the increased IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation and AHR observed in the presence of IL-17A is the result of the dissociation of the IL- 13R�1:TRAF3 complex following initiation of IL-17A signaling. Specific Aim 2 will dissect the importance of IL- 17A-driven activation of NF-�B (canonical versus non-canonical), C/EBP� and C/EBP� in IL-13/IL-17A synergy in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will directly test whether similar synergistic interactions between IL-13 and IL-17A are observed in asthma relevant, primary human cells. Additionally, we will determine whether severe asthma in children is associated, as it is in the mouse, with increased IL-17A production, IL17RA expression, and IL-17A responsiveness. Collectively, the studies proposed in this application will move us beyond the ""Th2 paradigm"" of allergic asthma, begin to characterize the mechanisms whereby Th17-products trigger the development of severe allergic asthma, and determine whether similar mechanisms may be at play in mice and humans. A better understanding of these mechanisms will enable us to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions in individuals with severe asthma, a population underserved by current therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Elevated IL-17A levels have been linked to the development of severe asthma in humans, a debilitating, treatment-resistant form of allergic asthma that accounts for the majority of asthma-related mortality and morbidity.

"Asthma symptom perception feedback intervention for ethnic minority adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under-perception of asthma symptoms in children is a major risk factor for emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and near-fatal/fatal asthma attacks. Puerto Rican and Black children have greater asthma morbidity and mortality rates than all other racial/ethnic groups. Interventions targeting asthma symptom perception and medication adherence may help close this asthma health disparities gap. There are no RCT studies to date designed to improve asthma symptom perception in ethnic minority children. This R01 study builds upon this new investigator PI's prior grants. We demonstrated that children who did not receive peak expiratory flow (PEF) feedback under-perceived asthma symptoms 42% of the time vs. 15% for the PEF feedback group and had lower controller medication adherence (27.5% vs. 48.8%).  The proposed randomized controlled trial consists of two arms: PEF feedback (N = 130) versus control feedback (N = 130). Latino and Black adolescents with asthma ages 10-17 years old and their caregivers will be recruited from clinics in the Bronx, NY. The primary aims are to examine the efficacy of PEF prediction with feedback versus control feedback on 1) under-perception of asthma symptoms 2) controller medication adherence and 3) asthma control and emergency health care use. These aims will be examined across a 1- year follow-up. An exploratory aim examines the hypothesized pathway that the PEF intervention reduces under-perception of symptoms, shifts illness representations toward the professional model and increases adolescents' and parents' asthma management self-efficacy, resulting in greater medication adherence and improved asthma control. The baseline visit for all families consists of standardized asthma education followed by 3 weeks of PEF prediction without feedback using a programmable, electronic spirometer. Participants then will be randomized to intervention group and their spirometer reprogrammed, showing either the actual PEF and daily asthma management messages (PEF feedback group) or a brief, positive message (control feedback group). For the next 6 weeks, all adolescents will predict their PEF, which will be locked in before blowing into the device. Families will return at mid-intervention and post-intervention to receive verbal individualized feedback on symptom perception and problem-solving skills training (PEF feedback group) or supportive counseling (control feedback group). All adolescents will play ""Quest for the Code"" to reinforce the baseline asthma education. At the post-intervention visit, the spirometer will be reprogrammed for all adolescents to provide no feedback for the next 4 weeks. These symptom perception data will be downloaded at 1-month post-intervention. Controller medication adherence will be monitored by electronic devices. Post-intervention sessions will take place at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to collect adherence data and conduct spirometry. Physicians will be blinded to group assignment and rate asthma control using national guidelines. A 12-month retrospective medical record abstraction will compare emergency health care use for asthma between groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An intervention to improve asthma symptom perception has great potential to reduce the immense ethnic disparities that exist in asthma outcomes. Prediction of peak expiratory flow followed by feedback can be applied on a large-scale level due to the accessibility of peak flow meters, brevity of the intervention, and immediate learning effects. Guessing peak expiratory flow can be appealing for adolescents, and it does not require any cultural adaptation due to the common language of peak expiratory flow.

"Social adversities and asthma: a new phenotype? ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a common and challenging disease of childhood that disproportionately affects poor minority populations. These populations also experience an excess of social adversities, which are important risk factors for asthma morbidity. However, the response to these adversities is variable: poverty increases the odds of asthma in African Americans, yet decreases it in Mexican Americans. Thus, there is a knowledge gap in our ability to identify individuals vulnerable to social adversities and truly at high-risk for poor asthma outcomes. I am seeking a Mentored NIH K23 Career Development Award to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading, independent researcher in asthma health outcomes. To move towards this goal, my overall objective for this award is to identify disadvantaged minority children at risk for poor asthma outcomes. My central hypothesis is a profile of demographic, social, and environmental characteristics coupled with stress-related biomarkers will predict which individuals are at high risk for poor asthma outcomes, and that this profile will vary by race/ethnicity. This will be testd with the following three aims. Specific Aim 1: Estimate the association between social adversities at individual- and community-levels with asthma susceptibility and morbidity. Social adversities have been identified from administered questionnaire, and geocoded census data obtained from personal address history through a cross-sectional study of 6200 children with and without asthma. Specific Aim 2: Examine if social adversities are associated with biomarkers of stress that may influence asthma susceptibility and morbidity. Stress-related biomarkers will be measured and a link between the biomarkers and asthma outcomes will be examined separately in African American and Latino children. Specific Aim 3: Identify a phenotype susceptible to social adversities and examine how it modifies the course of asthma using a longitudinal approach. A phenotype, or type of asthma, associated with social adversities amongst those with asthma will be identified. Participants with the identified phenotype will be recruited from the original study and followed to understand how this asthma type behaves over time in the presence of social adversities. This proposal will result in identifying an asthma phenotype that will allows us to target individuals at high-risk for poor asthma outcomes related to social adversities. This contribution is significant as utilizing stress related biomarkers may allow us to better risk stratify individuals and, potentially, capture them prior to adverse health outcomes occurring. A multi-disciplinary mentoring committee with diverse expertise: asthma (Drs. Burchard, Cabana), health disparities research (Drs. Burchard, Bibbins-Domingo, Cabana), biostatistics (Dr. Sen), and implementation sciences (Drs. Cattamanchi, Ackerman), will guide the progress of the research agenda. Their mentorship, as well as a focused training and research plan facilitated by a K23 award, will develop my expertise in health disparities research in asthma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American and Latino children experience an excess of poor asthma outcomes and social adversities. We are limited in our ability to identify the individuals who are the most susceptible to social adversities. With this proposal, a phenotype of asthma will be identified that will better discriminate individuals at high risk for poor asthma outcomes. This will allow for the development and application of targeted interventions designed to minimize the effect of social adversities and, thus, improve asthma outcomes in vulnerable populations.",Social adversities and asthma: a new phenotype?,9199229,K23HL125551,"['Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Affect ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Household ', ' Influentials ', ' Lipids ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Poverty ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Prasterone Sulfate ', ' Dehydroisoandrosterone Sulfate ', ' DHEA Sulfate ', ' DHA Sulfate ', ' Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' GALA ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' pulmonary function ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' experience ', ' income insurance ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' minority children ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2017,204859,0.4590780589726761
"The effect of a housing mobility program on environmental exposures and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Asthma morbidity continues to be a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods despite the availability of highly effective controller medications. Major contributors to the disproportionatey high asthma morbidity in this population are exposure to pest allergens (mouse and cockroach) and indoor pollutants (particulate matter (PM) due to second hand smoke and neighborhood PM). Efforts to reduce these exposures using home environmental interventions (EIs) have had only modest effects on measures of asthma symptoms and they have had little effect on reducing acute care visits or on improving lung function which are critical markers of high health care costs and poor long-term outcomes. The limited efficacy of EIs in this high-risk population is likely due to only modest reductions of indoor allergens and pollutants achieved by EIs. Housing mobility programs offer an alternative intervention with the strong potential to achieve large reductions in allergens and pollutants and thereby improve asthma health across a broad range of indicators including acute visits and lung function. We propose to conduct such a study in the context of the Baltimore Mobility Program (BMP), the nation's largest mobility program. We have partnered with BMP, and together have found that among families in BMP who have moved away from Baltimore City, pest allergen and PM exposures are much lower than in the homes of similar children living in Baltimore City. Our preliminary data and findings to date provide strong support for the hypothesis that moving to good quality housing in a better neighborhood through a housing mobility program will result in improvements in asthma outcomes, and that these improvements will be mediated by reductions in exposure to pest allergens and indoor PM. Through prospectively recruiting and following families as they enter into the Baltimore Mobility Program, we seek to address the following specific aims: (1) To determine the effect of moving from a low-income urban neighborhood to good quality housing in a better neighborhood on asthma-related outcomes by comparing outcomes among 5-17 year old children with persistent asthma who move to similar children who do not move, and (2) To estimate the causal effects of reducing indoor pest allergens and PM by moving to better housing on asthma outcomes using principal stratification, a statistical method for causal inference in environmental studies. The proposed study has the potential to have significant implications for the role of housing policy as a tool to address asthma disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma morbidity continues to be a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods, and the major contributors are thought to be due to exposures to pest allergens and indoor pollution. Reduction of home allergens and pollution is very difficult in homes in low-income urban neighborhoods where outdoor pollution is high and pest infestation is endemic, and housing mobility programs, which offer counseling and financial assistance for families to move to better neighborhoods, have strong potential to achieve large reductions in allergens and pollutants and thereby reduce asthma morbidity. Through prospectively recruiting and following families as they enter into the Baltimore Housing Mobility Program, we will determine the effect of moving from a low-income urban neighborhood to good quality housing in a better neighborhood on asthma-related outcomes among children with asthma.",The effect of a housing mobility program on environmental exposures and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children,9229021,R01ES026170,"['Affect ', ' Allergens ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Baltimore ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Cockroaches ', ' Dictyoptera ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' financial assistance ', ' Financial Support ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' IgE ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Exhalation ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' pollutant ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' secondhand smoking ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoking ', ' second hand smoke ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cockroach allergen ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Modification ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 years of age ', ' environmental intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' high efficiency particulate air filter ', ' HEPA cleaner ', ' HEPA Filtration ', ' HEPA Filter ', ' Indoor pollutant ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' indoor allergen ', ' mouse allergen ', ' minority children ', ' Section 8 ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIEHS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,677387,0.1840893626729233
"Text2Breathe: Enhance Parent Communication to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases, such as asthma, disproportionately affect African American (AA) children. A key recommendation of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma is partnership between healthcare providers and patients (and their parents, for children). Facilitating parents' open communication with providers regarding healthcare status and concerns can equip them to more effectively partner with their child's primary care provider (PCP). Thus, improving the health communication skills of African American (AA) parents could improve parent's adherence to treatment recommendations including utilization of the primary care for asthma care, and ultimately improve their child's asthma health outcomes. Our team recently completed a randomized controlled trial of an in- person health communication intervention that resulted in more partnerships with PCPs for asthma care and lower urgent care usage, but effects were not sustained past 2 months post-intervention. Mobile technology, such as Short Message Service (SMS, ""text messaging""), is a low-cost means of extending the dosage and scope of this intervention and may be particularly useful among AAs, for whom the use of SMS is widespread. The proposed study involves a SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention (Text2Breathe) designed to equip urban, low-income AA parents with tools/techniques to empower parents to more effectively communicate with their children's PCP. 268 AA parents of children attending an emergency department asthma education clinic will be randomized to usual care or Text2Breathe. The Text2Breathe group will receive ongoing individualized text messages providing instruction about asthma care communication during the year- long intervention period. Outcome data on parental self-efficacy and outcome expectations, adherence to asthma care treatment recommendations (e.g., primary care utilization), and child asthma outcomes will be collected via structured telephone interviews at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-enrollment. This trial can reduce pediatric health disparities by verifying the efficacy of a SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention that can extend to other chronic conditions and have health and policy implications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this text messaging intervention is to equip African American parents to effectively communicate with primary care providers about their child's asthma care needs. Increasing parents' self-efficacy is expected to enhance their adherence to treatment recommendations, specifically utilization of primary care and self- management, and thus improve children's asthma health outcomes. Results of the trial of this intervention can have broad impact on reducing pediatric health disparities because, if efficacious, this SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention can be extended to other chronic disease contexts where parent- provider communication is important.",Text2Breathe: Enhance Parent Communication to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities,9241255,R01MD007740,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Investigating the Relationships among Neighborhood Factors and Asthma Control in African American Children PROJECT SUMMARY Over 2.3 million children in the US have uncontrolled asthma, defined by ≥2 symptom days per week, >1 symptom night per month, activity limitation, and use of rescue medications >2 days per week. African American children are disproportionately affected by uncontrolled asthma; they are 4.1 times more likely to be treated in emergency departments and 7.6 times more likely to die from asthma than are non-Hispanic White children. Racial disparities in childhood asthma have been partially attributed to differential exposures to growing up in poverty, living in unsafe and stressful neighborhoods, and unhealthy physical environments (air pollution, poor quality of housing, presence of pests in the home, and exposure to secondhand smoke). Although many of these neighborhood level factors are difficult to change, one potentially modifiable factor that may improve asthma control is the availability of greenspace. Defined as land with grass, trees, or other vegetation, greenspace has been linked to decreases in stress, heat, and air-pollution, variables associated with better asthma control in children. However, the few studies that have directly examined the relationship between the availability of neighborhood greenspace and asthma have yielded mixed results. One reason for the mixed results may be that none have accounted for critical contextual factors that could influence children’s use of the greenspace in urban cities such as neighborhood safety. Parents living in unsafe neighborhoods are likely to keep their children indoors, thereby increasing their children’s exposures to indoor asthma triggers and limiting the potential health benefits of neighborhood greenspace. Controlling for indoor asthma triggers in children’s homes, this study will examine the associations among neighborhood greenspace, neighborhood safety, and level of asthma control in an existing sample of 222 predominantly low-income, African American children in Baltimore City. The specific aims of this descriptive, cross-sectional study are to examine: 1) the association between neighborhood greenspace and level of asthma control; 2) the associations among two indicators of neighborhood safety (neighborhood violent crime rate and parent perceptions of neighborhood safety), and level of asthma control; and 3) the extent to which neighborhood safety may moderate the association between neighborhood greenspace and level of asthma control. I will use multiple measures and informants to capture study variables including geocoding, neighborhood crime statistics, parent reports, and physiologic measures. The proposed research training plan is foundational to a program of study focused on developing skills in neighborhood level research of health disparities affecting children living in urban poverty. This research aligns with the National Institute of Nursing Research’s mission to promote wellness by investigating the complex relationships between environment and the trajectory of non-communicable disease with an emphasis on health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Uncontrolled asthma, which disproportionately affects African American children and those living in low-income neighborhoods, is a significant public health problem.

"ACTION Intervention: Physical Activity in Minority Women with Asthma ABSTRACT Asthma is a highly prevalent chronic disease that disproportionately impacts African American (AA) women. AA women have poorer asthma-related quality of life and higher rates of asthma exacerbations, healthcare utilization and mortality compared to Caucasian women. Further, AA women are less physically active than any other subgroup of adults, which may help explain the asthma health disparities, found between AA and Caucasian women. Physical inactivity among individuals with asthma is associated with poor asthma control and respiratory function, greater health care utilization, and poorer quality of life. Given the connection between poor asthma outcomes and physical inactivity, addressing physical activity (PA) among sedentary AA women with asthma is imperative. Physical activity demonstrated improvement in asthma outcomes specifically asthma control, quality of life and healthcare utilization. Despite these benefits, fewer than 25% of AA women with asthma engage in regular physical activity. The ACTION intervention: physicAl aCtiviTy In minOrity womeN with asthma is a 8-month community-based walking intervention refined to be applicable for sedentary AA women with asthma. This application proposes to obtain and incorporate stakeholder input on the barriers and facilitators to engaging in physical activity with asthma to a validated community-based walking intervention. Once modified, we will pre-pilot the intervention in 10 participants, refine further in response to participant feedback and then test the feasibility, acceptability and estimate the efficacy of the intervention in a randomized controlled pilot of 80 participants within a pragmatic community setting convenient for sedentary AA women. Through coursework, hands-on experience and strong mentorship this project will provide the dedicated candidate with the necessary skills to become an independent investigator and build an impactful research program on designing and implementing health promotion interventions to improve asthma outcomes in minority populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Physical inactivity in asthma is associated with worse asthma outcomes and African American women are disproportionately impacted by both physical inactivity and asthma. Research aimed at addressing the unique asthma-related and cultural-specific barriers to physical activity in this vulnerable population of women is needed. The proposed study will modify a validated community-based walking intervention specific to the needs of sedentary African American women with asthma and evaluate the impact of the intervention on physical activity and asthma specific indicators to reduce the burden of asthma in sedentary African American women.  ",ACTION Intervention: Physical Activity in Minority Women with Asthma,9392877,K01HL133370,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Interview ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Safety ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Walking ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Moderate Exercise ', ' moderate physical activity ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Modification ', ' cost ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' community safety ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' community setting ', ' public health priorities ', ' power analysis ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ', ' exercise regimen ', ' Exercise routine ', ' walking intervention ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,K01,2017,185155,0.3399383224865739
"Investigating Overweight/Obesity as a Susceptibility Factor for Secondhand Smoke in Childhood Asthma PROJECT SUMMARY  Childhood asthma and obesity are pressing health epidemics in the United States that disproportionately impact children who are minorities and come from households with lower incomes. Asthma in obese children tends to be more severe and refractory to treatment. An emerging explanatory hypothesis is that these children may be more vulnerable to components of air pollution. Secondhand smoke is a dominant source of indoor air pollution, particularly in the inner city, where up to 80% of children with asthma are regularly exposed. The differential effects of secondhand smoke based on weight are not known.  We hypothesize that secondhand smoke is preferentially deleterious to overweight or obese children with asthma, and that this relationship may correlate with differences in inflammation and oxidative stress. Because obesity is associated with basal elevations in inflammation and because asthma is associated with enhanced inflammation and oxidative stress, we believe that this is a plausible biologic mechanism.  We have discovered compelling preliminary evidence from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) that children who are overweight or obese report greater symptoms when exposed to secondhand smoke as compared to normal weight children. This project extends the results of this analysis to a local level, in more well-characterized cohorts of children who have both symptom and blood biomarker assessment. This study will be performed in (1) two large observational cohorts of children with asthma, comparing those who are and are not exposed to secondhand smoke, and in (2) an interventional cohort of children with asthma who are all exposed to secondhand smoke and have subsequent reductions in secondhand smoke exposure through the use of an advanced air purifier, comparing differences in asthma improvement between those who are normal weight and overweight or obese.  As body mass index is an imperfect marker for adiposity, this project will also examine if other different measures of adiposity, waist circumference and percentage body fat as estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, perform better than body mass index in identifying this vulnerable group. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood asthma and obesity are epidemics of increasing prevalence in the United States, and obese children with asthma tend to have more severe illness. One possible explanation is that overweight and obese children are more vulnerable to secondhand smoke, which is still very common despite significant public health interventions, especially in urban environments. Determining if this is true, and why it happens, is important to improve our understanding of childhood asthma and to better target interventions for the approximately one million children who have asthma, are overweight or obese, and are exposed to secondhand smoke.",Investigating Overweight/Obesity as a Susceptibility Factor for Secondhand Smoke in Childhood Asthma,9392616,F32ES028578,"['Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Baltimore ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' environmental testing ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Immersion Investigative Technique ', ' Immersion ', ' Inflammation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' airway symptom ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Indoor Air Pollution ', ' Mediating ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Bioelectrical Impedance ', ' Biolectric Impedance ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Refractory ', ' Biological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Body fat ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Investigation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' waist circumference ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' secondhand smoking ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoking ', ' second hand smoke ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Low income ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' urinary ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' evidence base ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' operation ', ' public health intervention ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to cigarette smoke ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' cigarette smoke exposure ', ' ']",NIEHS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,79078,0.31806503714587986
"BACKGROUND: Bettering Asthma Care in Kids - Geographic Social Determinants Data to Understand Disparities Project Summary/Abstract  Latino children with asthma have worse outcomes from their asthma than non-Hispanic white children. In the medical literature, the degree to which these outcomes are the result of limited access, underutilization, poor quality of care, or social & environmental factors is unclear. A fuller understanding of asthma outcomes in Latino children is hampered by scientific evidence that has relied upon cross-sectional studies with a limited time capture, or subjective surveys vulnerable to response biases. Additionally, some evidence in the health services literature suggests that social determinants of health (individual- and community-level economic, social, and environmental factors), including Hispanic subgroup (Mexican ancestry, Puerto Rican ancestry, etc) affect asthma care and outcomes. It is uncertain, however, which social determinants are most strongly associated with Latino children's asthma care.  The proposed project intends to fill these gaps in knowledge regarding the nature of asthma care disparities in Latino children and the relative contribution of social determinants of health to these disparities, by utilizing an objective, longitudinal, and robust linkage of data sources encompassing thousands of vulnerable children across multiple states. We will leverage a unique data resource from a large, national network of community health centers with shared electronic health record data that is linked to community-level social determinants of health data. This large, longitudinal dataset contains unprecedented data linkages which will let us assess disparities in asthma care, evaluate which social determinants affect utilization and disparities, and determine which of these may do so most significantly over time. We will also specifically develop methods to use community Hispanic subgroup information to estimate the individual subgroups of patient seen in our clinics (which is information not usually present in electronic health records), and how preventive service use differs among these groups  Understanding the relative impact of social determinants of health on asthma care in Latino children will: 1. Enable more informed policy decisions to improve the care of this vulnerable population, 2. facilitate strategic partnerships between healthcare providers and community agencies poised to intervene in social factors in the lives of Latino children, and 3. help clinical providers understand their patients' barriers to care utilization, and further point-of-care efforts to address the barriers that influence children's utilization of recommended health care services for their asthma. Project Narrative  Latino children with asthma have worse outcomes from their condition than non-Hispanic whites. Many demographic and social factors affect the health care of these children, but it is unknown which specific factors most significantly affect the care provided. This project will use a highly innovative, linked database that combines electronic health care data and community information to better understand which factors, including Hispanic subgroup, most heavily affect the care utilized by Latino children with asthma.",BACKGROUND: Bettering Asthma Care in Kids - Geographic Social Determinants Data to Understand Disparities,9445277,R01MD011404,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Geography ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Housing ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Nomads ', ' Migrant ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Mexican ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' preference ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' health data ', ' asthmatic ', ' built environment ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' data resource ', ' ']",NIMHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,543998,0.24659028218487994
"The Asthma Action at Erie Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma Action at Erie Trial Asthma prevalence and morbidity has been increasing among children over the last three decades despite significant advances in environmental control and asthma care. The annual costs for children with asthma range between $2.0 and $3.2 billion. Asthma morbidity and its associated costs are not borne equally; they are highest for urban, low income, African American and Puerto Rican children. Community health workers (CHWs) have been growing in popularity as a potential intervention to combat these asthma disparities. CHWs are frontline public health workers who serve as liaisons between health and social services and communities to facilitate access to services and improve the quality and cultural competence of service delivery. The evidence on CHW asthma intervention efficacy has been growing but several critical gaps still exist. The Asthma Action at Erie Trial will test the ability of a CHW intervention with three important modifications to achiev asthma control in high-risk children: 1) CHWs will be integrated into both the clinical and the home setting, 2) A system for directly addressing mental health and psychosocial barriers will be provided, and 3) Participants will be provided only materials and equipment for trigger remediation that are supported by the current medical reimbursement system. A two-arm behavioral randomized controlled trial (N=220) will be conducted in partnership with a federally- qualified health center (FQHC) serving a low income, minority population that is at high-risk for significant asthma morbidity. The intervention arm will receive an integrated CHW home intervention for pediatric asthma education. The comparison arm will received clinic-based certified asthma educator (AE-C) services. Primary Aim 1 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention, relative to clinic-based AE-C education over 12-months, as demonstrated by asthma control. We hypothesize that the CHW arm will have at least 30% fewer days with activity limitation than the AE-C arm at 12-months. Specific Aim 2 is to assess maintenance of intervention efficacy, as demonstrated by asthma control at 18 and 24 months after randomization. Specific Aim 3 is to determine the cost-effectiveness at 12-months of CHW and AE-C intervention delivery, and additional costs or savings related to asthma exacerbations at 12- and 24-months. Specific Aim 4 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention relative to clinic- based AE-C education, as demonstrated by asthma control, among those experiencing depression, stress, and/or a post-traumatic stress disorder. This trial compares the current best practice in asthma self- management education (AE-C services) to an integrated CHW home intervention in which the real-life challenges of patients and the health care system are taken fully into account. This trial will provide clarity a to the expected effect size, cost savings, and resources needed to integrate asthma CHWs into clinical practice. . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma Action at Erie Trial Support for community health worker (CHW) interventions is increasing rapidly despite an incomplete evidence base. This study uses a rigorous study design to determine the efficacy of a CHW home asthma intervention integrated into the clinic for high-risk children with asthma.

"Investigating the Relationships among Neighborhood Factors and Asthma Control in African American Children PROJECT SUMMARY Over 2.3 million children in the US have uncontrolled asthma, defined by ≥2 symptom days per week, >1 symptom night per month, activity limitation, and use of rescue medications >2 days per week. African American children are disproportionately affected by uncontrolled asthma; they are 4.1 times more likely to be treated in emergency departments and 7.6 times more likely to die from asthma than are non-Hispanic White children. Racial disparities in childhood asthma have been partially attributed to differential exposures to growing up in poverty, living in unsafe and stressful neighborhoods, and unhealthy physical environments (air pollution, poor quality of housing, presence of pests in the home, and exposure to secondhand smoke). Although many of these neighborhood level factors are difficult to change, one potentially modifiable factor that may improve asthma control is the availability of greenspace. Defined as land with grass, trees, or other vegetation, greenspace has been linked to decreases in stress, heat, and air-pollution, variables associated with better asthma control in children. However, the few studies that have directly examined the relationship between the availability of neighborhood greenspace and asthma have yielded mixed results. One reason for the mixed results may be that none have accounted for critical contextual factors that could influence children’s use of the greenspace in urban cities such as neighborhood safety. Parents living in unsafe neighborhoods are likely to keep their children indoors, thereby increasing their children’s exposures to indoor asthma triggers and limiting the potential health benefits of neighborhood greenspace. Controlling for indoor asthma triggers in children’s homes, this study will examine the associations among neighborhood greenspace, neighborhood safety, and level of asthma control in an existing sample of 222 predominantly low-income, African American children in Baltimore City. The specific aims of this descriptive, cross-sectional study are to examine: 1) the association between neighborhood greenspace and level of asthma control; 2) the associations among two indicators of neighborhood safety (neighborhood violent crime rate and parent perceptions of neighborhood safety), and level of asthma control; and 3) the extent to which neighborhood safety may moderate the association between neighborhood greenspace and level of asthma control. I will use multiple measures and informants to capture study variables including geocoding, neighborhood crime statistics, parent reports, and physiologic measures. The proposed research training plan is foundational to a program of study focused on developing skills in neighborhood level research of health disparities affecting children living in urban poverty. This research aligns with the National Institute of Nursing Research’s mission to promote wellness by investigating the complex relationships between environment and the trajectory of non-communicable disease with an emphasis on health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Uncontrolled asthma, which disproportionately affects African American children and those living in low-income neighborhoods, is a significant public health problem. This study will examine the benefits of neighborhood greenspace (i.e., land with grass, trees, and other vegetation), which has been shown to reduce air pollution and promote physical activity, on level of asthma control in African American children living in low-income neighborhoods.

"Peer-Administered Asthma Self-Management Intervention in Urban Middle Schools Project Summary/Abstract: Health disparities in pediatric asthma persist, with Latino children demonstrating increased asthma morbidity. Middle school children have greater morbidity than children from any other age group, yet there are no school- based asthma management programs developed for this group. To address these gaps, we have developed and piloted a novel group-based intervention: ASMAS (Asthma Self-MAnagement in Schools) in two geographic areas with a high proportion of urban, Latino children with asthma: Providence, Rhode Island, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. ASMAS is a 4-session, peer-facilitated asthma self-management intervention specific to the school setting for Latino middle school (6th-8th graders) children. It is delivered by trained Latino High School Juniors and Seniors with asthma, adapts guidelines-based self-management to the urban school setting, and is consistent with Latino children's cultural backgrounds. In our pilot RCT, ASMAS improved asthma outcomes and self-management for the targeted groups. Our proposed approach involves a hybrid design including a large-scale randomized, controlled trial investigating the effect of ASMAS, and an evaluation of the implementation process to inform future plans to test ASMAS in additional urban settings. Our first aim is to evaluate the effects of ASMAS on asthma health outcomes (e.g., control, symptom free days, absences, lung function) and asthma self-management (skills, knowledge and self-efficacy, availability of rescue inhaler and action plan at school) in a sample of 432 Latino middle school children with asthma in Providence, RI and San Juan, PR (216 per site; 72 per condition). 6th to 8th grade middle schoolers will be enrolled then randomly assigned to 1) ASMAS, or 2) Asthma Education plus Child Health control condition, or 3) a no treatment control condition (9 groups of each condition per site; 8 children per group). Student and primary caregiver assessments will occur at baseline, end of treatment (directly following the intervention), and at three, 4-month post intervention follow-ups. Our second aim is to conduct a mixed-methods, multi-stakeholder process evaluation using the RE-AIM framework,48-50 with students, caregivers, HS Peers, school administrators and additional community stakeholders invested in supporting students' asthma care. We will begin to develop implementation strategies with key stakeholders to better prepare for future large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of ASMAS and its implementation in additional urban centers. Relative to controls, over 1 year, we expect that ASMAS participants will have improved asthma outcomes and self- management. We also expect treatment effects on asthma outcomes will be mediated through changes in self- management in all children, and moderated by acculturative stress and language proficiency in RI children. The proposed work offers a critical opportunity to evaluate ASMAS for improving asthma outcomes for children at high risk on a larger-scale and to develop avenues for sustainability and future dissemination with state and community stakeholders. Project Narrative Health disparities in pediatric asthma persist, with Latino children demonstrating increased asthma morbidity. Middle school children with asthma have greater morbidity than children from any other age group and spend a majority of their day in school, where they must manage any asthma. We developed and piloted a novel group- based intervention - ASMAS (Asthma Self-MAnagement in Schools) in two geographic areas with a high prevalence of urban and Latino children with asthma: Providence, Rhode Island, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. ASMAS is a 4-session, peer-facilitated asthma self-management intervention specific to the school setting for Latino middle school (6th-8th graders) children. It is delivered by trained High School Juniors and Seniors of Latino descent with asthma. We demonstrated the preliminary effects of ASMAS for improving asthma outcomes and self-management relative to controls. In this proposal, we will evaluate ASMAS through a large- scaled Randomized Control Trial with urban middle school students who have persistent asthma in Providence, RI and San Juan, Puerto Rico and we will identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of ASMAS. These results will allow us to prepare for future, large-scale dissemination in other urban school settings.",Peer-Administered Asthma Self-Management Intervention in Urban Middle Schools,9572430,R01MD012225,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Play ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Quality Control ', ' Records ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Administrator ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Penetration ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Sample Size ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' age group ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' eighth grade ', ' 8th grade ', ' eleventh grade ', ' high school junior ', ' 11th grade ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' junior high school ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dominican ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' post intervention ', ' pilot trial ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' rescue inhaler ', ' asthma reliever ', ' asthma controller ', ' asthma MDI ', ' asthma inhaler ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' treatment effect ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' symptom improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' intervention effect ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Middle School Student ', ' attentional control ', ' school district ', ' primary care giver ', ' primary caregiver ', ' urban children ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' urban school ', ' urban setting ', ' Child Health ', ' clinical implementation ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIMHD,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2018,761480,0.42882070450118714
"Investigating Overweight/Obesity as a Susceptibility Factor for Secondhand Smoke in Childhood Asthma PROJECT SUMMARY  Childhood asthma and obesity are pressing health epidemics in the United States that disproportionately impact children who are minorities and come from households with lower incomes. Asthma in obese children tends to be more severe and refractory to treatment. An emerging explanatory hypothesis is that these children may be more vulnerable to components of air pollution. Secondhand smoke is a dominant source of indoor air pollution, particularly in the inner city, where up to 80% of children with asthma are regularly exposed. The differential effects of secondhand smoke based on weight are not known.  We hypothesize that secondhand smoke is preferentially deleterious to overweight or obese children with asthma, and that this relationship may correlate with differences in inflammation and oxidative stress. Because obesity is associated with basal elevations in inflammation and because asthma is associated with enhanced inflammation and oxidative stress, we believe that this is a plausible biologic mechanism.  We have discovered compelling preliminary evidence from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) that children who are overweight or obese report greater symptoms when exposed to secondhand smoke as compared to normal weight children. This project extends the results of this analysis to a local level, in more well-characterized cohorts of children who have both symptom and blood biomarker assessment. This study will be performed in (1) two large observational cohorts of children with asthma, comparing those who are and are not exposed to secondhand smoke, and in (2) an interventional cohort of children with asthma who are all exposed to secondhand smoke and have subsequent reductions in secondhand smoke exposure through the use of an advanced air purifier, comparing differences in asthma improvement between those who are normal weight and overweight or obese.  As body mass index is an imperfect marker for adiposity, this project will also examine if other different measures of adiposity, waist circumference and percentage body fat as estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, perform better than body mass index in identifying this vulnerable group. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood asthma and obesity are epidemics of increasing prevalence in the United States, and obese children with asthma tend to have more severe illness. One possible explanation is that overweight and obese children are more vulnerable to secondhand smoke, which is still very common despite significant public health interventions, especially in urban environments. Determining if this is true, and why it happens, is important to improve our understanding of childhood asthma and to better target interventions for the approximately one million children who have asthma, are overweight or obese, and are exposed to secondhand smoke.",Investigating Overweight/Obesity as a Susceptibility Factor for Secondhand Smoke in Childhood Asthma,9572392,F32ES028578,"['Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Baltimore ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' environmental testing ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Immersion Investigative Technique ', ' Immersion ', ' Inflammation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' airway symptom ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Indoor Air Pollution ', ' Mediating ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Bioelectrical Impedance ', ' Biolectric Impedance ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Refractory ', ' Biological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Body fat ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Investigation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' waist circumference ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Low income ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' urinary ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' obesity in children ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' evidence base ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' operation ', ' public health intervention ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' Passive Smoke Exposure ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' ']",NIEHS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,67378,0.31806503714587986
"BACKGROUND: Bettering Asthma Care in Kids - Geographic Social Determinants Data to Understand Disparities Project Summary/Abstract  Latino children with asthma have worse outcomes from their asthma than non-Hispanic white children. In the medical literature, the degree to which these outcomes are the result of limited access, underutilization, poor quality of care, or social & environmental factors is unclear. A fuller understanding of asthma outcomes in Latino children is hampered by scientific evidence that has relied upon cross-sectional studies with a limited time capture, or subjective surveys vulnerable to response biases. Additionally, some evidence in the health services literature suggests that social determinants of health (individual- and community-level economic, social, and environmental factors), including Hispanic subgroup (Mexican ancestry, Puerto Rican ancestry, etc) affect asthma care and outcomes. It is uncertain, however, which social determinants are most strongly associated with Latino children's asthma care.  The proposed project intends to fill these gaps in knowledge regarding the nature of asthma care disparities in Latino children and the relative contribution of social determinants of health to these disparities, by utilizing an objective, longitudinal, and robust linkage of data sources encompassing thousands of vulnerable children across multiple states. We will leverage a unique data resource from a large, national network of community health centers with shared electronic health record data that is linked to community-level social determinants of health data. This large, longitudinal dataset contains unprecedented data linkages which will let us assess disparities in asthma care, evaluate which social determinants affect utilization and disparities, and determine which of these may do so most significantly over time. We will also specifically develop methods to use community Hispanic subgroup information to estimate the individual subgroups of patient seen in our clinics (which is information not usually present in electronic health records), and how preventive service use differs among these groups  Understanding the relative impact of social determinants of health on asthma care in Latino children will: 1. Enable more informed policy decisions to improve the care of this vulnerable population, 2. facilitate strategic partnerships between healthcare providers and community agencies poised to intervene in social factors in the lives of Latino children, and 3. help clinical providers understand their patients' barriers to care utilization, and further point-of-care efforts to address the barriers that influence children's utilization of recommended health care services for their asthma. Project Narrative  Latino children with asthma have worse outcomes from their condition than non-Hispanic whites. Many demographic and social factors affect the health care of these children, but it is unknown which specific factors most significantly affect the care provided. This project will use a highly innovative, linked database that combines electronic health care data and community information to better understand which factors, including Hispanic subgroup, most heavily affect the care utilized by Latino children with asthma.",BACKGROUND: Bettering Asthma Care in Kids - Geographic Social Determinants Data to Understand Disparities,9572957,R01MD011404,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Affect ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' child healthcare ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Community Education ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Geography ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Housing ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Nomads ', ' Migrant ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Mexican ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' preference ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' health data ', ' asthmatic ', ' built environment ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' health care community ', ' healthcare community ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' data resource ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NIMHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,522785,0.24659028218487994
"A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention for Rural Latino Children K23 Abstract A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention  for Rural Latino Children DESCRIPTION: Rural Latino children with asthma suffer high rates of uncontrolled asthma symptoms, emergency department visits, and repeat hospitalizations. This vulnerable population must negotiate micro and macro level challenges that impact asthma management, including language barriers, primary care access, parental time off from work, insurance coverage, distance from specialty sites, and documentation status. There are few proven interventions that address asthma management embedded within this unique context. Using a bio-ecological approach, we will determine the feasibility of a patient-centered collaborative program between rural Latino children with asthma and their families, school based nursing, and primary care providers, facilitated by the use of a smart phone based mobile application (mobile app) with a Spanish-language interface. We hypothesize that improving communication through a collaborative, patient-centered intervention will improve asthma management, empower the patient and family, decrease outcome disparities, and decrease direct and indirect costs. The specific aims of this study include: 1) Produce and validate a Spanish translation of an existing asthma management app and evaluate its usability with Latino parents of children with asthma; 2) Develop and evaluate a triadic, patient-centered asthma intervention preliminary protocol, facilitated by the bilingual mobile app validated in aim 1; and 3) Investigate the feasibility of the patient-centered asthma intervention from aim 2 using a wait list randomized control trial (RCT) to investigate the effects of the intervention on school days missed and medication adherence. The results of this study will be used to support a full scale randomized control trial R01 grant application in Year 4 of this award. The career development award will provide Dr. Estrada the mentoring and training needed to develop knowledge and skills in rural asthma disparities research, intervention development and program evaluation, and integration of technology- based interventions. At the close of the award, she will be positioned to design, implement, and evaluate research that will significantly impact rural asthma disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is growing evidence that rural asthma rates are similar to urban asthma rates, yet prior research has focused on urban population groups and interventions. Additionally, rural Latino children with asthma have unique challenges and barriers that contribute to health outcomes disparities. The findings from the proposed research will support the development of a targeted and cost-effective intervention that may improve asthma outcomes in this vulnerable population group.",A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention for Rural Latino Children,9538237,K23HL133596,"['Affect ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communication ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Language ', ' Mentors ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' South Carolina ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Transportation ', ' Urban Population ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Population Group ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Indirect Costs ', ' Facilities and Administrative Costs ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' Home visitation ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' usability ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' control trial ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,K23,2018,144033,0.4020677342516417
"SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The proliferation of smartphones and sensors has made continuous monitoring of physiology, environment, and public health notifications possible. However, personalized digital health and patient empowerment will become reality only if massive multisensory and multimodal observational data is processed within patient context and made actionable to enable early detection; better diagnosis, effective prevention and treatment of the disease; and improve the quality of life. This research will be performed in the context of asthma, which affects 300 million people and claims over 250,000 lives worldwide annually. According to CDC, 9.3% of US children have asthma. Understanding asthma and its management is challenging; it is a multifactorial disease with subjective causes and symptoms, and extant diagnosis and treatment guidelines can be improved using evidence-based action recommendation. With the advent of mobile and connected sensors, timely information about asthma triggers has become available, and its exploitation requires precisely understanding and quantifying the sensed data's role for preventive and proactive assessment of asthma. In this application led by computer scientists and a practicing clinician, we address the central problem of deriving actionable information from data monitored using kHealth technology. Through a pilot study, we have tested our kHealth kit equipped on several pediatric patients under the guidance of a clinical doctor for reliable data collection and patient operation, with promising initial results. We build on this foundation by addressing the problem of semantic representation, integration, abstraction, and personalized interpretation of heterogeneous observations spanning physiological, environmental data, and online data in the context of medical knowledge. Our primary hypothesis is that an evidence-based approach to asthma can help doctors determine more precisely the cause, severity and control of asthma, and can alert patients to seek timely clinical assistance to better manage asthma. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This application direclty relates to NICHD mission of improving health of children, with focus on asthma that affects a significant population. The kHealth system uses multiple sensors, mobile application and intelligent, personalized processing to predict health risks associated with asthma in children to develop a preventative and proactive

"ACTION Intervention: Physical Activity in Minority Women with Asthma ABSTRACT Asthma is a highly prevalent chronic disease that disproportionately impacts African American (AA) women. AA women have poorer asthma-related quality of life and higher rates of asthma exacerbations, healthcare utilization and mortality compared to Caucasian women. Further, AA women are less physically active than any other subgroup of adults, which may help explain the asthma health disparities, found between AA and Caucasian women. Physical inactivity among individuals with asthma is associated with poor asthma control and respiratory function, greater health care utilization, and poorer quality of life. Given the connection between poor asthma outcomes and physical inactivity, addressing physical activity (PA) among sedentary AA women with asthma is imperative. Physical activity demonstrated improvement in asthma outcomes specifically asthma control, quality of life and healthcare utilization. Despite these benefits, fewer than 25% of AA women with asthma engage in regular physical activity. The ACTION intervention: physicAl aCtiviTy In minOrity womeN with asthma is a 8-month community-based walking intervention refined to be applicable for sedentary AA women with asthma. This application proposes to obtain and incorporate stakeholder input on the barriers and facilitators to engaging in physical activity with asthma to a validated community-based walking intervention. Once modified, we will pre-pilot the intervention in 10 participants, refine further in response to participant feedback and then test the feasibility, acceptability and estimate the efficacy of the intervention in a randomized controlled pilot of 80 participants within a pragmatic community setting convenient for sedentary AA women. Through coursework, hands-on experience and strong mentorship this project will provide the dedicated candidate with the necessary skills to become an independent investigator and build an impactful research program on designing and implementing health promotion interventions to improve asthma outcomes in minority populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Physical inactivity in asthma is associated with worse asthma outcomes and African American women are disproportionately impacted by both physical inactivity and asthma. Research aimed at addressing the unique asthma-related and cultural-specific barriers to physical activity in this vulnerable population of women is needed. The proposed study will modify a validated community-based walking intervention specific to the needs of sedentary African American women with asthma and evaluate the impact of the intervention on physical activity and asthma specific indicators to reduce the burden of asthma in sedentary African American women.  ",ACTION Intervention: Physical Activity in Minority Women with Asthma,9480871,K01HL133370,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Interview ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Safety ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Woman ', ' Walking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Moderate Exercise ', ' moderate physical activity ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Modification ', ' cost ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' community setting ', ' public health priorities ', ' power analysis ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ', ' Exercise routine ', ' exercise regimen ', ' walking intervention ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,K01,2018,185155,0.3399383224865739
"Physical Activity and Dose of Air Pollution in Pediatric Urban Asthma: Impact of Minute Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY  Exposure to traffic related air pollution (TRAP) is known to trigger childhood asthma symptoms and likely contributes to the disparity in asthma prevalence and morbidity in urban communities. Regular physical activity can improve asthma symptoms. However, increased minute ventilation (ie respiratory rate x tidal volume) during activity may increase deposition of pollutant particles into the airways. Thus, pollution may offset the respiratory benefits of physical activity. One of the challenges of accurately assessing the combined effects of pollution and activity on the airways is that inhaled dose of pollutants could vary by proximity to exposure source and by individual differences in minute ventilation. Therefore, our objective is take an individualized approach to assess change in minute ventilation during childhood activities while also considering variability in home and school exposure to TRAP.  We hypothesize that the positive association between exposure to TRAP and asthma symptoms will be most significant among children that are 1) highly physically active and 2) have larger increases in minute ventilation in response to physical activity. In order to address this hypothesis we will take advantage of 2 existing cohorts of children with differing severity of asthma that are enrolled in the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) studies. For our first aim we will examine the interaction between exposure to TRAP (assessed at home and school using geographic information systems (GIS) technology) and physical activity (assessed by validated questionnaire) on asthma symptoms. We will evaluate these associations in: 1) a cross-sectional cohort of 320 moderate-severe asthmatics, ages 6-17 that live in 10 urban US cities and 2) a 3 year longitudinal cohort of 150 mild-moderate asthmatics, ages 12-16 that live in 4 urban US cities. For our second aim we will recruit a sub-sample of 40 children with mild- moderate asthma that live in New York City. We will combine individual cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with 72-hour accelerometry measurements to determine the magnitude of increase in minute ventilation in response to usual childhood activities. Then we will use these values to determine if larger individual increases in minute ventilation influence the relationship between exposure to TRAP and asthma symptoms. With an enhanced understanding of individual susceptibility to environmentally triggered asthma, we will be better equipped to address and remediate the disproportionate risk of asthma morbidity among urban children. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Exposure to traffic related air pollution is known to trigger childhood asthma symptoms and likely contributes to the disparity in asthma prevalence and morbidity in urban communities. During physical activity, increased respiratory rates and deeper breathing may lead to increased inhaled dose of pollutants. The objective of this research is to determine if increased childhood physical activity and larger increases in breathing patterns in response to physical activity strengthen the association between exposure to pollution and asthma symptoms.",Physical Activity and Dose of Air Pollution in Pediatric Urban Asthma: Impact of Minute Ventilation,9436721,K01HL140216,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Exercise ', ' Exercise stress test ', ' Exercise Test ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Seasons ', ' Soot ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tidal Volume ', ' respiratory airway volume ', ' United States ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' Ventilation ', ' Weather ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Exposure to ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' Pollution ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' respiratory ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' skills ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' airway epithelium inflammation ', ' airway inflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Coupled ', ' asthmatic ', ' respiratory health ', ' traffic-related air pollution ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Accelerometer ', ' urban children ', ' minority children ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' recruit ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2018,173105,0.3435122504858623
"An Asthma Collaboration to Reduce Childhood Asthma Disparities on the Navajo Nation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Asthma prevalence among children on the Navajo Nation, the largest tribal reservation in the United States, is 2-3 times that of the general population and fueled by health disparities that include devastating poverty, multiple environmental pollutants, and large travel distances to obtain healthcare. Delivery of evidence-based asthma care through the Indian Health Service (IHS), the only healthcare system on the reservation, is inconsistent. While schools and communities identify pediatric asthma as a strong concern, no comprehensive asthma care implementation plan has been previously introduced. Therefore, this proposed study will combine two previously tested programs, one focused on training providers and one on school-based education and monitoring, to build a comprehensive, integrated, team-based Asthma Care Implementation Program to address medical care, family, home, and community to improve the health of Navajo children with asthma. A one-year engagement phase has resulted in strong support from Navajo Nation organizations including the President and Vice President of the Navajo Nation, governmental organizations, healthcare centers, schools, and communities in the three participating agencies (Fort Defiance, Chinle, and Tuba City). Approval of the proposed study by the Navajo Nation Human Research Review Board has been obtained. Key recommendations from communities including use of existing resources such as the Navajo Epidemiology Center, Navajo Health Department, local media, lay health workers, and ongoing involvement of stakeholders are included in this plan. Using a stepped-wedge design, the intervention will be introduced sequentially into three agencies. A mixed-methods analysis strategy will be employed that includes annual examination of asthma exacerbations through the IHS database (primary outcome), interviews with 300 families with a child with asthma, and key informant interviews with healthcare providers and school teachers and nurses. During the sustainability phase, meetings will be held with multiple organizations including local chapter houses to share outcome data, gather feedback, and plan for future dissemination to other agencies and reservations. The RE-AIM framework will be employed to evaluate the implementation process and facilitate dissemination to other tribal populations.

"Spatio-temporal models of allergenic pollen for human exposure and health investigations 4.4.7: Project Summary Pollen allergies afflict over 35 million Americans, and the economic cost of treating these allergies exceeds 12 billion dollars annually. The effects on human health are considerable because pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing asthma and can trigger fatal asthma attacks. Despite the importance of these public health concerns, urban areas are filled with plants that produce allergenic pollen, many of which are intentionally cultivated. This preventable situation is caused by a lack of knowledge concerning: 1) how pollen production and dispersal from individual plants leads to heterogeneity in airborne allergenic pollen concentrations on small spatial scales (e.g., tens to hundreds of meters); and 2) the extent to which exposure to allergenic pollen is responsible for triggering asthma attacks and other respiratory symptoms. This project's objective is to quantify these processes and show how allergenic pollen producing plants affect human health. The main components of this research include: • Characterizing pollen production and spatial dispersal patterns using a pollen sampling  field study focused on Norway maple (Acer platanoides), white mulberry (Morus alba),  box elder (Acer negundo), and common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia); • Creating a spatially explicit model of airborne pollen concentrations as a function of  plant composition using a comprehensive street tree database; • Adding a temporal dimension to the spatial pollen count predictions using  meteorological data, daily pollen count data from a National Allergy Bureau pollen  counting station, and a small citizen science plant phenology monitoring program; and • Linking pollen exposure to health effects including asthma attacks and respiratory  symptoms, using existing datasets collected in the study area, Detroit, MI. These include  respiratory related hospital visits extracted from geocoded Medicaid claims data and  cohort studies that tracked 255 children's respiratory health for >12 months. Understanding the contribution of particular plants to pollen concentrations in urban areas has will allow land owners, municipalities and others to actively manage plant composition to reduce allergenic pollen exposure and its health effects. These translational benefits are especially important in both highly vegetated and ""shrinking"" cities, such as Detroit, where large vacant areas are providing habitat for allergenic plants that likely exacerbate health disparities. 4.4.8: Project narrative Allergenic pollen triggers asthma attacks and causes severe allergic reactions, but little is known about how much airborne pollen particular people are exposed to. This study will quantify allergenic pollen production and dispersal in an urban area, estimate where and when pollen concentrations are high, and test how exposure affects respiratory disease.",Spatio-temporal models of allergenic pollen for human exposure and health investigations,9539887,F32ES026477,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cities ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Medicaid ', ' Meteorology ', ' Norway ', ' Plants ', ' Pollen ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' airway symptom ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Trees ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' pulmonary function ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Morus ', ' Mulberry ', ' Acer ', ' Maple ', ' Ambrosia ', ' Ragweed ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' meter ', ' respiratory ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Municipalities ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' Acer negundo ', ' Box Elder ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' land use ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Habitats ', ' case control ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Plant Sources ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Allergic Reaction ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' human exposure ', ' exposed human population ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' respiratory health ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' citizen science ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2018,61174,0.27855278148007767
"School-Based Asthma Care for Teens (SB-ACT) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood, and despite current advances in therapies, morbidity and mortality continue to increase. Low-income, minority teenagers have disproportionately high rates of asthma morbidity, including excess risk of emergency department care, hospitalization, and death from asthma, compared to white adolescents. Although urban children suffer the largest burden from asthma, they are the least likely group to receive adequate preventive care, and poor adherence plays a significant contributing role in asthma morbidity. Inner city adolescents with asthma are at particular risk of nonadherence.  Thus, there is a substantial amount of suffering that could be prevented with improvements in care. This application builds on our extensive experience with efficacious school-based programs for urban children and teens with asthma. The overall goal is to broadly disseminate a novel system of asthma care throughout the entire city school district ('School Based Asthma Care for Teens'; SBACT), and test its effectiveness in improving adherence and reducing morbidity among urban teens.  The SB-ACT intervention includes two core components. First, adolescents visit the school nurse daily for 6-8 weeks at the start of the school year to receive a trial of directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medications. The goal is for the teen to establish a relationship with the nurse, learn proper medication technique, and experience the benefits and value of daily preventive therapy. Four to 6 weeks after the initiation of DOT, the teen will receive a motivational interviewing (MI) counseling program designed to  enhance the teen's motivation to transition to independent, sustained preventive medication use. We will train community-based nurses affiliated with the local American Lung Association to deliver the MI component. The MI nurse will conduct three counseling sessions with the teen at school, which are designed to capitalize on the teen's experience with DOT and the potential benefits they experienced. Given the complex nature of  asthma care in this population, we plan to evaluate this intervention using a 3-group design in which 430 teens  will be randomly assigned to either; 1) the SB-ACT program (trial of DOT for 6-8 weeks + 3 MI counseling  sessions); 2) DOT-only (DOT only for 6-8 weeks); or 3) an asthma education (AE) comparison group (in-school  asthma education delivered by a trained asthma educator). We include the DOT-only group to evaluate whether this component alone is sufficient to promote sustained adherence without counseling. The AE group is designed to enhance asthma care and control for the attention received in MI counseling. We will assess the effectiveness of the SB-ACT intervention in reducing asthma morbidity, perform an economic sustainability analysis, and evaluate each component of program implementation with a focus on sustainability and dissemination. At the completion of the study, the effectiveness of this system of school-based asthma care will be better defined as a sustainable means to improve care for adolescents and reduce health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urban adolescents with asthma suffer from substantial morbidity and suboptimal preventive care. This project may have a profound impact on public health because it proposes the implementation of an innovative, efficacious intervention to promote adherence to effective asthma care guidelines throughout an entire urban school district. Built upon our extensive prior work in the city schools, this program has the potential t serve as a sustainable model to improve asthma care for this understudied population and reduce health disparities.",School-Based Asthma Care for Teens (SB-ACT),9505959,R18HL116244,"['Absenteeism ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Belief ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Nursing Schools ', ' Nurse Training Schools ', ' Secondary Schools ', ' secondary education ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' satisfaction ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Guideline Adherence ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' age group ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Modeling ', ' Directly Observed Therapy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' American Lung Association ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' ER care ', ' ED care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' post intervention ', ' comparison group ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' chronic care model ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' demographics ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' Therapy trial ', ' attentional control ', ' school district ', ' improved outcome ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' urban children ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' urban school ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R18,2018,653215,0.41219125723709243
"New Approaches for Empowering Studies of Asthma in Populations of African Descent Asthma is a complex disease with striking disparities across racial and ethnic groups, which may be partly attributable to genetic factors. A major goal of the Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA) has been to discover genes conferring risk to asthma in populations of African ancestry. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying genes associated with increased risk of asthma, but there is a substantial gap between associations discovered by GWAS and understanding how these loci control disease. A major portion of the `missing heritability' could be due to variants with smaller effects missed by traditional GWAS thresholds, emphasizing the need for a transition to integrative genetics, where transcriptome, proteome, methylome and metabolome information are brought into a unified framework. Our goal in this continuing renewal is to apply an integrative, multi-omics approach to understand the molecular architecture underlying asthma, building upon the 5-year CAAPA program, where >16,000 asthmatics and non-asthmatics have already been GWAS-genotyped, and GWAS and/or whole genome sequencing (WGS) data are available on more than 100,000 non-CAAPA samples. We propose to test if genetic variants control development of asthma by regulating gene transcription and expression, DNA methylation, metabolic profiles, and proteome variation. The specific aims of this application leverage an international group of investigators with diverse but highly integrated areas of expertise, and include the following: (1) expand and integrate multi-omic resources for asthma research in African Diaspora populations and identify novel genetic determinants for risk of asthma by adding indigenous American and continental African genetic representation in the African Diaspora catalog, building a multi-omic repository through newly generated transcriptome, methylome, proteome, and metabolome data from CAAPA asthmatics and unaffected controls with existing GWAS data from 7 sites in North and South America, the Caribbean and Africa, and performing integrative analyses; (2) broadly disseminate CAAPA results through a web-based resource that empowers the asthma research community for new discoveries; and (3) develop and apply approaches for prioritizing CAAPA results in 3 health systems biobanks enriched for US minority populations (Nashville, New York City, and the Rocky Mountain region) by examining genomics (PheWAS) and multi-omics (PrediXcan) asthma associations identified in CAAPA and non-CAAPA datasets. These studies will advance our understanding of the molecular basis for asthma among populations of African ancestry. The Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA) will expand and build a multi-omics repository in populations with African ancestry, from continental Africa and the Americas, for integrative analysis to empower discovery and functional interpretation of asthma genetic risk. We will also implement web-based technologies to develop an online community resource for asthma researchers, and investigate the impact of asthma loci in three large health systems.

Research Plan: The research proposed involves an innovative investigation of the effects of experimental sleep disruption on immune balance (Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio-Th1/Th2R; plasma IL-6 -pIL-6), and associated changes in asthma- related lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) and daytime performance in urban children with persistent asthma (8-10 years old). Forty children and their primary caregiver will each participate in a within-subjects protocol, with two experimental sleep conditions: baseline sleep (1 overnight, in-lab polysomnographic (PSG) sleep study), followed by sleep fragmentation (1 overnight, in-lab PSG). Prior to each condition, children will follow a 6-day sleep stabilization schedule at home. We will monitor sleep and lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) daily to confirm eligibility and adherence to sleep criteria, and assess asthma status. We include assessments of immune biomarkers and daytime performance following each condition. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentoring Plan: The proposed mentoring plan offers opportunities for mentorship of postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty with interests in POR. Mentees will be involved in ongoing longitudinal and intervention studies on pediatric asthma disparities, including the proposed research, which will focus on biological-based processes that contribute to asthma and sleep in urban children. A strong emphasis is placed on the recruitment and selection of minority mentees. This overall plan capitalizes on the rich resources and training opportunities available to postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty at Brown Medical School, including several T32 fellowship programs, numerous junior faculty with K awards and small grants, a commitment to diversity in training, seminars in research design, ethics, and statistics, and an established infrastructure for evaluation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pediatric health disparities in the area of asthma and sleep continue to exist. Urban poverty and poorly controlled asthma can both adversely impact sleep quality by disrupting the continuity of nighttime sleep. Increased asthma symptoms and sleep disruption have each been linked with changes in immune balance. The immune imbalance associated with asthma in children may be greater in the context of sleep disruption, and this may adversely impact daytime functioning and increase inflammation that can bring on asthma symptoms. This K24 application will provide mentorship in patient-oriented research to post-doctoral fellows, residents, and junior faculty interested in multi-level contributing factors to disparities in pediatric asthma. The research proposed involves the implementation of an experimental approach to examine the effects of sleep disruption on immune imbalance, asthma-related lung function, and daytime performance in urban children (ages 8-10) with persistent, allergic asthma. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentorship goals involve providing training to post-doctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty, particularly those from minority backgrounds, in patient-oriented research focused on pediatric health disparities. The proposed career training activities to enhance knowledge and assessment of asthma clinical immunology and sleep physiology, will allow for more broadened opportunities for mentorship to trainees. In addition to the proposed research, mentees will be provided with multiple, ongoing opportunities for training in patient-oriented research on pediatric asthma health disparities.",Pediatric Asthma

"nmMLCK Contributes to Genetic and Environmental Asthma Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe asthma represents ~10% of all asthma but carries a significantly greater mortality risk especially for African descent (AD) individuals. Environmental factors (such as exposure to particulate matter air pollution or PM) and genetic factors are likely critical to defining susceptibility to severe asthma and provide insights into tis area of serious health disparity. In this regard, the non-muscle isoform of myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK), encoded by MYLK, actively participates in the pathogenesis of vascular barrier disruption and lung inflammatory cell trafficking, each an essential contributor to asthmatic inflammation. In lung endothelial cells (EC), nmMLCK is a multifunctional cytoskeletal mediator central to regulation of EC actin cytoskeletal rearrangement via phosphorylation of myosin light chains (MLCs). Our previous studies further identified that African ancestry is associated with asthma risk with coding and non- coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding nmMLCK, MYLK, over-represented in AD individuals strongly associated with severe asthma. This R01 renewal will characterize the pathobiological functions of MYLK SNPs associated with severe asthma in under-represented minority backgrounds, thereby directly addressing an important health disparity. To address our hypothesis that nmMLCK expression and functional activity (inflammatory regulation) are dysregulated in severe asthma & influenced by SNPs enriched in AD populations, Specific Aim #1 will evaluate MYLK SNPs found in non-hispanic caucasians, Latino & African descent children and adult populations for association with severe asthma. We will conduct mid-throughput genotyping studies in ~4000 asthma patients (European descent, African descent, Latino Puerto Rican, and Latino Mexican)and identify severe asthma-related SNPs. Specific Aim #2 will characterize the effects of severe asthma-associated SNPs and Paticulate Matter (PM) exposure on nmMLCK mRNA expression and function via effects on MYLK 5'UTR promoter activity, 3'UTR binding activity to miRNAs, promoter CpG island methylation, and mRNA secondary structure. Specific Aim #3 will functionally analyze effects of severe asthma-associated MYLK coding SNPs on nmMLCK protein structure and function (kinase activity, protein binding, and lamellipodial dynamics). Finally, Specific Aim #4 will validate these severe asthma-associated SNPs in vivo, and evaluate novel nmMLCK inhibitors designed to diminish PM-exacerbated asthmatic inflammatory lung injury. Supported by compelling published and preliminary data, we believe these integrated translational studies will lead to mechanistic insights into asthma pathobiology and the health disparity of severe asthma while facilitating the development of novel, potentially population-specific, inflammation-reducing therapies for asthma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Severe asthma, representing ~10% of all asthma, carries a significantly greater mortality and is a key area of serious health disparity with Americans of African descent experiencing greater asthma mortality compared to individuals of European descent. Environmental factors (such as exposure to particulate matter air pollution) and genetic factors in genes such as MYLK may prove to be critical to defining the susceptibility to severe asthma.

"Improving Patient-Centered Outcomes after Discharge among Patients Hospitalized with Asthma Exacerbations by Focusing on a Transition-to-Home Plan with Community Health Workers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic disease, affecting more than 10% of American children (>7 million children <18 years)1 and disproportionately impacting urban, minority, and disadvantaged children.2 Despite the evidence-based guidelines for standardized care from the NIH,3 overall morbidity among youth with asthma, whether measured by attack rates, emergency department (ED) visits, or hospitalizations, has not significantly decreased in the last decade.4 Striking disparities persist among youth with asthma, as socio- economically disadvantaged, urban, and minority children throughout the United States incur a disproportionate share of asthma-related morbidity.2,5 The overall ED visit rate for asthma, for example, among non-Hispanic African Americans (AAs) aged 0-17 years is 4.1 times greater than that among non-Hispanic whites, while the ED visit rate among Hispanics in the same age group is 1.8 times greater than non-Hispanic whites. Similarly, the asthma death rate among non-Hispanic AAs aged 0-17 years is 7.3 times greater than that among non-Hispanic whites, while the death rate among Hispanics in the same age group is 1.2 times greater than non-Hispanic whites.5 In a recent study to prioritize comparative effectiveness research in hospital pediatrics, asthma ranked as the #1 leading non-surgical diagnose for pediatric hospital admission, totaling costs of $570 million annually.6 Of striking importance for the health care system is that asthma is also in the top diagnoses for all-cause readmissions, with 80% of these asthma readmissions deemed potentially preventable readmissions.7 In this career training award, with a strong mentorship team, I propose a highly patient-centered approach to identifying and improving optimal outcomes for patients and families transitioning home after inpatient admissions for asthma exacerbations. Using the care coordination framework proposed by the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in June 2014,8 my mentors and I will utilize principles of patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) and comparative effectiveness research (CER) to design and pilot a program of community health worker (CHW)-facilitated transition-to-home focusing on the changeover of care from inpatient to outpatient for patients hospitalized with asthma exacerbation. This project is highly significant (addressing a vulnerable transition for patients admitted with a common and costly pediatric chronic illness with high rate of preventable readmissions) and highly innovative (using a qualitative approach to identify stakeholders' perspectives to refine AHRQ's care coordination framework to improve the transition from hospital to home by utilizing CHW and pilot testing feasibility and acceptability, and patient-centered outcomes). Our overall aim is to develop and evaluate a patient-centered transition-to-home plan leveraging CHWs to target high risk pediatric patients requiring hospital admission for asthma exacerbations. Our hypothesis is that CHWs will improve patient-centered outcomes during the transition from inpatient to outpatient care.

"Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management - Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP) In the US, children from minority ethnic and racial backgrounds suffer disproportionately from asthma. Despite well established guidelines, under-treatment for asthma is common, especially for poor and minority populations. Our prior work has demonstrated that school-based directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medications can improve outcomes for poor, urban children with persistent asthma. We have also found that school-based telemedicine can effectively facilitate assessments by primary care providers (PCPs) for preventive medication prescriptions for DOT and for follow-up care. However, to our concern we have found that children do not benefit equally from our programs. Specifically, among the subgroup of children with moderate to severe persistent or difficult to control asthma at baseline, the majority did not achieve control despite these school-based interventions. In fact, despite telemedicine follow-up assessments with PCP prompting for guideline-based step-ups in treatments, many of these children remained under-treated. We realize that our existing programs may be insufficient for these children, since they do not include specialist consultation for optimization of medication management or for identification and treatment of co-morbid conditions and triggers. Importantly, specialist care is substantially underutilized by poor and minority children who bear the greatest morbidity burden from asthma, leading to inconsistent delivery of guideline-based treatments and continued disparities. In response to PAR-15-279, we propose an innovative school-based program for urban children with moderate to severe persistent or difficult to control asthma. The Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management-Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP) program enhances our school-based, primary care directed asthma program with specialist-supported care to ensure optimal guideline-based treatment. We propose a randomized trial of TEAM-UP versus an enhanced care comparison group. We will prompt PCPs of all enrolled children (n=360, 4-12 years) to initiate school-based DOT of preventive asthma medication and will recommend referral to an asthma specialist. For children in TEAM-UP, the specialist visits will be facilitated via telemedicine at school. The initial telemedicine specialist visit will be scheduled after 4 weeks of DOT, in order to allow for accurate guideline-based assessments of medication and care needs once adherence with a daily controller medication is established. There will also be 2 telemedicine follow-up specialist visits to assess the child's response to treatment and make needed adjustments. We will capitalize on the existing community infrastructure by implementing both telemedicine and DOT in schools, and maintaining collaboration with the PCP. We will assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of TEAM-UP in reducing morbidity and improving guideline-based care (primary outcome: symptom-free days at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) versus enhanced care. At the study's completion, the program will be better defined as a sustainable means to improve care and reduce morbidity for high risk children with difficult to control asthma. NARRATIVE - RELEVANCE This project is expected to have a profound impact on public health because it proposes an innovative intervention, built from our previously successful school-based programs, to address gaps in the care of children at highest risk for poor asthma outcomes. We aim to ensure optimal guideline-based asthma management using school-based telemedicine to link high risk children with specialist directed asthma care in partnership with primary care providers. Should this program prove successful in improving the health of urban children with moderate to severe persistent or difficult to control asthma, it has the potential to serve as a sustainable model for improved asthma care in this population.",Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management - Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP),9582384,R01HL142691,"['Absenteeism ', ' Adoption ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Nursing Schools ', ' Nurse Training Schools ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Schedule ', ' Specialist ', ' Medication Management ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' satisfaction ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Exhalation ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Visit ', ' Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1 ', ' PFT/FEV1 ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume 1 Test ', ' FEV1%VC ', ' FEV1 ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Directly Observed Therapy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' comparison group ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' Minority ', ' airway epithelium inflammation ', ' airway inflammation ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' chronic care model ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' follow up assessment ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' improved outcome ', ' urban children ', ' minority children ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2018,766996,0.43101719114205606
"Translating an Efficacious Illness Management Intervention for African American Youth with Poorly Controlled Asthma to Real World Settings There is a critical need to develop interventions to reduce barriers to optimal asthma management and reduce the significant risk for asthma-related morbidity experienced by minority children, especially African- American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma. There are few clinical trials focusing on African-American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma, and intervention studies targeting African-American adolescents with asthma in general or African-American children with poorly controlled asthma in particular are characterized by methodological limitations and/or limited effects on objective health outcomes. Multisystemic Therapy-Health Care (MST-HC) is an intensive, multi-component, home-based psychotherapy that targets the multiple causes of poor adolescent asthma management across individual, family and community systems. In a randomized clinical trial, we showed that MST-HC was significantly more effective than home-based family support in improving adherence to controller medications and improving lung functioning among African- American adolescents with moderate to severe, poorly controlled asthma up to six months after the completion of the intervention. In addition, MST-HC reduced asthma-related hospitalizations and associated ED visits. The primary purpose of the proposed study is to adapt MST-HC for use in real world, public healthcare settings and test it in a T3 translational trial. The new intervention, Reach for Control (RFC), will be housed in a pediatric emergency department (ED) at Children's Hospital of Michigan (CHM)and will be adapted for delivery by community health workers (CHWs). The design is an effectiveness-implementation “Hybrid 1” design where the primary aims are to determine the effectiveness of an evidence-based intervention in a real-world setting, and the secondary aims are to gather information about the context for implementation and barriers/ facilitators to implementation. For our effectiveness aim, we will conduct a randomized effectiveness trial with 170 high risk adolescents with poorly controlled asthma seen in the ED for an asthma exacerbation. RFC will be delivered by Wayne Children's Healthcare Access Program, a community agency providing health care services to underserved children in the Detroit area and will be compared to the agency's standard care intervention for youth with poorly controlled asthma. For our implementation aims, we will evaluate the effectiveness of identification, screening and referral to RFC by ED clinical staff via a clinical pathway. We will study barriers and facilitators to the implementation of RFC (both its integration within the ED and delivery by CHWs) using a mixed methods approach. We will also develop and evaluate an efficient and effective method of measuring CHW fidelity to RFC and conduct a cost analysis that will inform decisions such as treatment dose and CHW caseload in future real-world implementations. If successful, the study has the potential to improve quality of life for a vulnerable population while reducing healthcare costs.   There is a critical need to develop and disseminate successful illness management interventions for African American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma.

"Mechanisms of IL-17A-mediated enhancement of asthma severity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lung that currently afflicts more than 300 million people worldwide. While asthma is mediated by an excessive Th2 immune response to allergens, recent evidence suggests that production of the Th17 cytokine, IL-17A, is associated with the development of more severe disease. While severe asthmatics are at greatest risk for morbidity or death following acute exacerbations, and can be refractory to therapies that are highly effective in individuals with mild disease, the molecular mechanisms whereby IL-17A contributes to the development of severe allergic asthma are ill-defined. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A facilitates severe asthma would provide additional therapeutic targets for populations underserved by current therapies. Using a mouse model we provide evidence that severe asthma is associated with increased IL-17A production, and is compounded by enhanced Il17ra expression and elevated responsiveness to IL-17A. These alterations in IL-17A production and responsiveness exacerbate IL-13-driven STAT6 activation, gene expression, and airway responses. Our preliminary data suggests that IL-17A-mediated enhancement of IL-13-driven responses occur through two, non-mutually independent mechanisms in mouse cells; 1) by causing the dissociation of a complex including IL-13R�1 and TRAF3, which normally limits IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation, and 2) by activating transcription factors (NF-�B, C/EBP� and C/EBP�) which can enhance IL-13/STAT6 driven gene expression. While preliminary studies presented here also suggest that similar mechanisms may operate in human cell lines, the extent to which the observations made in our mouse model apply to humans with severe asthma is unclear. Three specific aims are proposed to identify the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A enhances asthma severity in mice, and humans. Specific Aim 1 will determine if the increased IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation and AHR observed in the presence of IL-17A is the result of the dissociation of the IL- 13R�1:TRAF3 complex following initiation of IL-17A signaling. Specific Aim 2 will dissect the importance of IL- 17A-driven activation of NF-�B (canonical versus non-canonical), C/EBP� and C/EBP� in IL-13/IL-17A synergy in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will directly test whether similar synergistic interactions between IL-13 and IL-17A are observed in asthma relevant, primary human cells. Additionally, we will determine whether severe asthma in children is associated, as it is in the mouse, with increased IL-17A production, IL17RA expression, and IL-17A responsiveness. Collectively, the studies proposed in this application will move us beyond the ""Th2 paradigm"" of allergic asthma, begin to characterize the mechanisms whereby Th17-products trigger the development of severe allergic asthma, and determine whether similar mechanisms may be at play in mice and humans. A better understanding of these mechanisms will enable us to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions in individuals with severe asthma, a population underserved by current therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Elevated IL-17A levels have been linked to the development of severe asthma in humans, a debilitating, treatment-resistant form of allergic asthma that accounts for the majority of asthma-related mortality and morbidity. However, the mechanisms through which IL-17A exacerbates disease severity remain unclear, representing an important knowledge gap that is preventing the development of novel treatments that directly address the unique disease processes driving pathogenesis in severe asthma. The long term goal of the current project is the design of novel therapeutics that specifically disease in severe asthmatics, a population underserved by current treatments.",Mechanisms of IL-17A-mediated enhancement of asthma severity,9460529,R01HL122300,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Allergens ', ' Animals ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity -

"The effects of a housing mobility program on home environmental and host airway microbiota and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma morbidity is a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods, and contributors to asthma disparities may include home environmental exposures to biotic material. While allergens and endotoxin have been studied extensively, less is known about the role of bacterial and fungal communities, about the upstream influence of environmental microbiota on airway microbiota, and about the downstream contributions of airway microbiota to asthma morbidity. Therefore, we will take advantage of a natural experiment to understand whether changes in microbiota occur in children who move from high-poverty, urban neighborhoods to low-poverty neighborhoods, primarily in the suburbs, through the Baltimore Housing Mobility Program (BHMP), the nation's largest mobility program. We will leverage existing support for a prospective cohort study of children with asthma and their families enrolled through BHMP to evaluate the hypothesis that moving to a low-poverty neighborhood through a housing mobility program will result in changes in home microbial exposures (bacterial and fungal communities). We further hypothesize that changes in the microbial composition and diversity of home exposures will be linked to alterations in microbial composition of the child's airway and improvements in asthma, controlling for changes in other biotic pollutants. Through prospectively evaluating 5-17 year old children with persistent asthma and their home environments before and after they and their families move with the support of BHMP, we seek to address the following specific aims: 1) To assess the effects of moving from a high-poverty urban neighborhood to a low-poverty suburban neighborhood on home and child airway microbiota, and 2) To explore the influence of changes in home dust and child airway microbiota on asthma outcomes. The proposed study's findings will provide new insights into environmental causes of asthma disparities and greater understanding of how changes in home environmental and child airway microbiota may influence asthma morbidity among low-income children. NARRATIVE Asthma morbidity is a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods, and an emerging literature points to a potential significant role for microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) in asthma. Geographic differences in home environmental microbiota have been demonstrated between urban and suburban communities, suggesting the strong potential that these differences could be involved in asthma disparities. By evaluating children with established asthma who move from a high-poverty urban neighborhood to a low-poverty suburban neighborhood with their families given the support of the nation's largest housing mobility program, our work will contribute critical evidence to identify the upstream role of environmental microbiota on host microbiota, and to explore the downstream role of host airway microbiota on the trajectory of allergic asthma in a high-risk population. !",The effects of a housing mobility program on home environmental and host airway microbiota and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children,9528901,R21AI133492,"['Allergens ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Bacteria ', ' Baltimore ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Endotoxins ', ' Family ', ' fungus ', ' Geography ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Hygiene ', ' IgE ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' Literature ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' extrinsic allergic asthma ', ' atopic asthma ', ' Allergic asthma ', ' Extrinsic asthma ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' Family Study ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' insight ', ' Rural ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Exhalation ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' House Dust ', ' household dust ', ' home dust ', ' Housedust ', ' interest ', ' Farming environment ', ' Farm ', ' inner city ', ' pollutant ', ' microbial ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 years of age ', ' 17 year old ', ' community microbes ', ' microbial community ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' home environmental exposure ', ' household environmental exposure ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' urban poverty ', ' built environment ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbiota ', ' minority children ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' suburban communities ', ' urban setting ', ' recruit ', ' resident microflora ', ' resident microbes ', ' host microbiota ', ' airway microbiota ', ' airway microbial community ', ' respiratory microbiota ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,256060,0.29528110955243425
"Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication and Social Adversity (ASTHMA) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Pediatric asthma has a substantial public health burden with numerous contributing risk factors in the physical, social, and health care environments. This burden is elevated among low-income minority children living in urban areas, related in part to multi-factorial residential exposures. There are numerous complex feedback loops among risk factors, with interventions potentially inducing behavioral responses that modify levels of other risk factors. Given these characteristics, pediatric asthma is an ideal candidate for systems science tools to prioritize among risk factors and design intervention strategies. However, there have been few applications of systems science techniques to asthma, and no applications to date that take account of multiple risk factors with housing, social and behavioral components. Discrete event simulation (DES), a systems science approach that involves modeling a complex system in which individuals can be tracked over time, multiple attributes can be incorporated simultaneously, and interactions and non-linear effects can be incorporated, is ideally suited for this application. This project (the Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication, and Social Adversity - ASTHMA) builds upon the only DES model of pediatric asthma or the physical environment, leveraging data from a longstanding electronic health record (EHR) database, and extensive neighborhood contextual data available from a BU center of environmental health disparities. Building on prior expertise and the strength of an established interdisciplinary team we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: To build the Boston Children’s Healthcare Disparities Repository (BCHDR), a large database of predominantly low-income and racial/ethnic minority asthmatic children extracted from the BMC EHR, and use it to develop associations among key predictors of lung function, medication prescription and adherence, social adversity, asthma outcomes, and healthcare utilization. Aim 2: To predict exposure to indoor pollutants and environmental conditions across a range of housing types, resident behaviors, and sociodemographic characteristics, in a manner useful for DES modeling. Aim 3: To expand the existing DES model to capture the variability in housing, sociodemographic, and neighborhood environments for asthmatic children in the BCHDR, and evaluate the influence of implemented or proposed policies addressing housing conditions, medication adherence, and aspects of social adversity on asthma outcomes. These data and methods collectively allow us to develop unique insights about the individual and cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on asthma outcomes, as well as about how candidate interventions would influence asthma outcomes given the multiple pathways and complex behavioral responses. While we focus on data specific to Boston to ensure internal consistency, our methods and insights will generalize to other urban settings, our housing modeling approach can be expanded to any are in the US, and our discrete event simulation code and methodology for extracting and analyzing clinical and social risk factor data from an EHR could be adapted to other circumstances. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication, and Social Adversity (ASTHMA) will yield a simulation model that can characterize the effects of indoor environmental exposures, social risk factors, medication adherence, and neighborhood contextual factors on asthma outcomes among low-income children. ASTHMA will incorporate indoor air quality models, building simulations, statistical models using medical and social adversity data from electronic health records, and GIS derived neighborhood contextual variables, with sufficient data to characterize feedback loops and interactions among risk factors. We will develop insight about how candidate interventions – related to housing construction and management, community, individual, and public housing policies – in low-income housing can influence chemical exposures, social stressors, and corresponding health outcomes.","Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication and Social Adversity (ASTHMA)",9527830,R01ES027816,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' Boston ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' child healthcare ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Crime ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' Humidity ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' Publishing ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' Ventilation ', ' Measures ', ' Indoor Air Quality ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' stressor ', ' pollutant ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Published Database ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Department of Energy ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' community intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' intervention effect ', ' simulation software ', ' Indoor pollutant ', ' asthmatic ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral response ', ' model building ', ' minority children ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' PM2.5 ', ' fine particles ', ' data resource ', ' urban setting ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' ']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,571720,0.30352371910305587
"Epigenetics of Socio-Environmental Effects on  Asthma in Minorities Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of children, with an estimated 300 million cases worldwide and significant increases in incidence since the early 1980s. In the U.S., asthma prevalence, morbidity mortality, and drug response vary substantially among racial and ethnic groups. Over the last decade, our research has demonstrated that differential social experiences, including discrimination, neighborhood air quality, place of birth, and acculturation are associated with asthma and asthma health disparities. However, unlike genetic associations, discovering socio-environmental risk factors does not directly provide a path to genes or pathways. This major limitation impedes our understanding of asthma biology, reducing the rate of progress towards treatment and prevention. Our goal in this work is to identify the genes and pathways affected by socio-environmental exposures to improve our mechanistic understanding of asthma. This will lead to improved prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, particularly for Latinos and African Americans, who bear a disproportionate burden of this disease. We hypothesize that DNA methylation will provide the genomic bridge between socio-environmental factors and disease. Methylation, a long lasting but dynamic measure of cellular states, is highly correlated to environmental exposures and demographic characteristics, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, and ancestry. We will develop advanced statistical methods to anchor specific epigenetic loci associated with both asthma and socio-environmental factors. To execute this research program, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team with complementary expertise in socio-environmental epidemiology, asthma, genetics, epigenetics, and statistical methods. Our team will study a unique cohort of minority children and parent-child trios of Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and African Americans, who have existing longitudinal survey and molecular based measures of socio-environmental exposures, genotypes, and RNA/DNA sequences. Results from our work will help: (i) identify new classes of therapeutic targets, different from those discovered via genetics, (ii) precisely treat patients by selecting interventions using epigenetic markers, (iii) improve risk profiling, especially for minority populations, and (iv) provide the global research community with the largest methylation dataset on minority children produced to date, with a substantially increased value due to existing clinical, socio-environmental, genetic, and functional genomic data. The goal of our project is to identify the genomic pathways that are altered by socio-environmental factors, including stress and experiences of discrimination, and underlie health disparities in asthma and other complex diseases. To accomplish this goal, we will assemble the world's largest multi-ethnic asthma cohort of minority children with measures of epigenetic, genetic, functional genomic, and socio-environmental risk factors. Of particular importance is ensuring we develop powerful statistical methods for analyzing these data. Achieving this goal requires expertise across many domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development, and expertise in socio-environmental epidemiology.",Epigenetics of Socio-Environmental Effects on  Asthma in Minorities,9600384,R56MD013312,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Birth Place ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Whole Blood ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' experience ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' functional genomics ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Heritability ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapeutic target ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' minority children ', ' racial identity ', ' ethnic identity ', ' genomic data ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R56,2018,458438,0.3234649118830712
"The Asthma Action at Erie Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma Action at Erie Trial Asthma prevalence and morbidity has been increasing among children over the last three decades despite significant advances in environmental control and asthma care. The annual costs for children with asthma range between $2.0 and $3.2 billion. Asthma morbidity and its associated costs are not borne equally; they are highest for urban, low income, African American and Puerto Rican children. Community health workers (CHWs) have been growing in popularity as a potential intervention to combat these asthma disparities. CHWs are frontline public health workers who serve as liaisons between health and social services and communities to facilitate access to services and improve the quality and cultural competence of service delivery. The evidence on CHW asthma intervention efficacy has been growing but several critical gaps still exist. The Asthma Action at Erie Trial will test the ability of a CHW intervention with three important modifications to achiev asthma control in high-risk children: 1) CHWs will be integrated into both the clinical and the home setting, 2) A system for directly addressing mental health and psychosocial barriers will be provided, and 3) Participants will be provided only materials and equipment for trigger remediation that are supported by the current medical reimbursement system. A two-arm behavioral randomized controlled trial (N=220) will be conducted in partnership with a federally- qualified health center (FQHC) serving a low income, minority population that is at high-risk for significant asthma morbidity. The intervention arm will receive an integrated CHW home intervention for pediatric asthma education. The comparison arm will received clinic-based certified asthma educator (AE-C) services. Primary Aim 1 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention, relative to clinic-based AE-C education over 12-months, as demonstrated by asthma control. We hypothesize that the CHW arm will have at least 30% fewer days with activity limitation than the AE-C arm at 12-months. Specific Aim 2 is to assess maintenance of intervention efficacy, as demonstrated by asthma control at 18 and 24 months after randomization. Specific Aim 3 is to determine the cost-effectiveness at 12-months of CHW and AE-C intervention delivery, and additional costs or savings related to asthma exacerbations at 12- and 24-months. Specific Aim 4 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention relative to clinic- based AE-C education, as demonstrated by asthma control, among those experiencing depression, stress, and/or a post-traumatic stress disorder. This trial compares the current best practice in asthma self- management education (AE-C services) to an integrated CHW home intervention in which the real-life challenges of patients and the health care system are taken fully into account.

"The effect of a housing mobility program on environmental exposures and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Asthma morbidity continues to be a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods despite the availability of highly effective controller medications. Major contributors to the disproportionatey high asthma morbidity in this population are exposure to pest allergens (mouse and cockroach) and indoor pollutants (particulate matter (PM) due to second hand smoke and neighborhood PM). Efforts to reduce these exposures using home environmental interventions (EIs) have had only modest effects on measures of asthma symptoms and they have had little effect on reducing acute care visits or on improving lung function which are critical markers of high health care costs and poor long-term outcomes. The limited efficacy of EIs in this high-risk population is likely due to only modest reductions of indoor allergens and pollutants achieved by EIs. Housing mobility programs offer an alternative intervention with the strong potential to achieve large reductions in allergens and pollutants and thereby improve asthma health across a broad range of indicators including acute visits and lung function. We propose to conduct such a study in the context of the Baltimore Mobility Program (BMP), the nation's largest mobility program. We have partnered with BMP, and together have found that among families in BMP who have moved away from Baltimore City, pest allergen and PM exposures are much lower than in the homes of similar children living in Baltimore City. Our preliminary data and findings to date provide strong support for the hypothesis that moving to good quality housing in a better neighborhood through a housing mobility program will result in improvements in asthma outcomes, and that these improvements will be mediated by reductions in exposure to pest allergens and indoor PM. Through prospectively recruiting and following families as they enter into the Baltimore Mobility Program, we seek to address the following specific aims: (1) To determine the effect of moving from a low-income urban neighborhood to good quality housing in a better neighborhood on asthma-related outcomes by comparing outcomes among 5-17 year old children with persistent asthma who move to similar children who do not move, and (2) To estimate the causal effects of reducing indoor pest allergens and PM by moving to better housing on asthma outcomes using principal stratification, a statistical method for causal inference in environmental studies. The proposed study has the potential to have significant implications for the role of housing policy as a tool to address asthma disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma morbidity continues to be a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods, and the major contributors are thought to be due to exposures to pest allergens and indoor pollution. Reduction of home allergens and pollution is very difficult in homes in low-income urban neighborhoods where outdoor pollution is high and pest infestation is endemic, and housing mobility programs, which offer counseling and financial assistance for families to move to better neighborhoods, have strong potential to achieve large reductions in allergens and pollutants and thereby reduce asthma morbidity. Through prospectively recruiting and following families as they enter into the Baltimore Housing Mobility Program, we will determine the effect of moving from a low-income urban neighborhood to good quality housing in a better neighborhood on asthma-related outcomes among children with asthma.",The effect of a housing mobility program on environmental exposures and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children,9495696,R01ES026170,"['Affect ', ' Allergens ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Baltimore ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cities ', ' Dictyoptera ', ' Cockroaches ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' IgE ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Exhalation ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' pollutant ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cockroach allergen ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Modification ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 years of age ', ' 17 year old ', ' environmental intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' HEPA cleaner ', ' HEPA Filtration ', ' HEPA Filter ', ' high efficiency particulate air filter ', ' Indoor pollutant ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' indoor allergen ', ' mouse allergen ', ' minority children ', ' Section 8 ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIEHS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,666149,0.1840893626729233
"Integrative Analyses to Uncover Biological Mechanisms Mediating Gene Associations with Asthma Drug Response Among Minority Children PROJECT SUMMARY Identifying genetic variants associated with complex diseases via genome-wide SNP and whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies has outpaced our ability to translate these findings into actionable biologic and clinical insights. We need to use in silico methods that integrate multiple layers of data, including transcriptomic, epigenetic, social, and environmental, to focus experimental validation on the most impactful targets. Asthma-related deaths are 4-fold higher in minority children than white children. Moreover, minority children with asthma have markedly decreased drug response to albuterol, a bronchodilator rescue medication that is the most commonly prescribed asthma medication in the world, and to glucocorticoids, anti-inflammatory medications that decrease symptoms and exacerbations. Our goal is to understand the biological basis of differential drug response that leads to observed racial/ethnic asthma disparities. In this proposal, we use two cloud-based apps we developed to identify functional biologic mechanisms of genes that are associated with racial/ethnic variation in asthma therapies. Specifically, our apps 1) provide gene-centric WGS association findings in the context of integrated multi-tissue omic results, and 2) reprioritize WGS association results using machine-learned tissue-specific networks constructed from gene expression, known protein-protein interactions, and established functional pathways. Our results will increase knowledge about the biological role of genes associated with asthma therapy and facilitate design of experiments to understand their function.

"West Philadelphia Asthma Care Implementation Plan Project Summary/Abstract:  The Community Asthma Prevention Program (CAPP) has a two-decade history of utilizing CHWs to improve asthma outcomes of children in Philadelphia. Building on this foundation, we established a network of stakeholders, The West Philadelphia Asthma Care Collaborative (WEPACC), with representation from public housing, healthcare, community, and schools. As a result of assessment of local needs, resource mapping, and months of planning, we designed an asthma care implementation program with the broad objective of integrating home, school, healthcare system, and community for school-aged asthmatic children in West Philadelphia. We will accomplish this goal using CHWs to deliver sustainable patient-centered evidence- based interventions. The evidence-based interventions include (1) a primary care-based Yes We Can intervention with home visitation and (2) a comprehensive and rigorously evaluated school-based intervention, Open Airways for schools and School Based Asthma Therapy. CHWs will function as the hub of each interventions, serving either as primary care CHWs or school CHWs to provide a network of education, care coordination support, and to facilitate communication for families of children with asthma between the four sectors. This project is innovative in that it seeks to integrate interventions in a comprehensive and sustainable manner to reduce asthma disparities in poor, minority children.  Using a factorial design, we will recruit and randomize 600 asthmatic children (ages 6-12 years) from three inner-city primary care clinics who attend one of 23 West Philadelphia schools to one of four study conditions: both interventions (both primary care and school CHWs intervention), primary care CHW or school- CHW alone, or control and follow for one year. We will accomplish the following objectives: Specific Aim 1. Compare effectiveness of the primary care and school interventions to improve asthma control and reduce symptom days using main and simple effects from the factorial design. Specific Aim 2. Explore moderators and mechanisms of effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions. Specific Aim 3. Use mixed methods to explore implementation determinants and outcomes of school intervention that promote effectiveness, fidelity and sustainability Specific Aim 4. Examine the costs, savings, and cost effectiveness associated with the intervention and implementation strategies to promote sustainability 1 Project Narrative: This project uses community health workers or lay health educators to implement asthma interventions that have been proven to work in order to connect the caregiver, community, school and health sectors.

"Rhode Island Asthma Integrated Response Program (RI-AIR) Project Summary/Abstract: Greater Providence, Rhode Island is comprised of several urban “core” cities of high poverty and significant pediatric asthma disparity. The RI-Asthma Integrated Response (RI-AIR) Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP) is a comprehensive system of identification, screening and intervention for pediatric asthma. Core components include: a 1) state of the art technology platform (the RI-AIR information data system, or RI-AIR IDS) to integrate data from LifeChart (EHR), REDCap (research data system), and KIDSNet (state-based database of child health information), 2) algorithm for stratification of asthma management services based on level of asthma control/risk, 3) multilevel school-based education (CASE) to family/child/school system for children whose asthma is not well-controlled, 4) intensive home-based intervention (HARP) for children with poorly controlled asthma, and 5) enhanced coordination between caregiver, school nurse, and health care provider to promote integration across sectors of care. The first aim of the proposed work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the RI-AIR ACIP using a randomized, stepped wedge design. During Years 2-4, we will provide our intervention sequentially to sixteen high-risk communities involving approximately 1500 urban, ethnically diverse children (aged 2-12) with asthma and their families. We will evaluate both individual-level (e.g., asthma control) and community-specific outcomes (i.e., rates of ED a multi-level process evaluation of the RI-AIR ACIP during implementation (Years 2-5). We will assess penetration within identified communities and school districts, and evaluate characteristics of families that accept and complete the intervention vs. those who do not. We will determine fidelity of the RI-AIR IDS technology platform in assigning interventions according to asthma control/risk, and treatment fidelity and dose delivered of the HARP and CASE programs. We will use focus groups and provider surveys to determine facilitators of and barriers to visits) for children with asthma. The second aim of this application involves conducting effective implementation. The third aim involves conducting a mixed-methods evaluation of the sustainability of the RI-AIR ACIP, with ongoing input from our community stakeholders during Years 5-6. We define sustainability as continued capacity, continued activities, and continued benefits. We expect over 1 year, participants receiving the RI-AIR ACIP will have improved asthma control and fewer symptom free days relative to baseline. We expect over 1 year, relative to baseline, caregivers will have improved asthma knowledge, self-efficacy, asthma QOL, and indicators of effective disease management. We expect over 1 year, communities receiving the RI-AIR ACIP will have reduced ED visits and hospitalizations relative to their baseline year, and relative to targeted communities that have not yet received RI-AIR. We plan to demonstrate that RI-AIR ACIP is a replicable, evidence-based and cost-saving model that improves asthma outcomes for children at most risk, and can be disseminated to other urban communities to address asthma disparities. Project Narrative Pediatric asthma is a significant public health problem. Striking asthma disparities continue despite available clinical guidelines to manage asthma in home and school settings. There is a crucial need for coordinated systems of asthma care. This proposal will evaluate the effectiveness of the RI-Asthma Integrated Response (RI-AIR) Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP), a comprehensive system of identification, screening and intervention for pediatric asthma, targeted toward high-risk communities in greater Providence, RI. The RI- AIR ACIP is based on home and school interventions for pediatric asthma that have established efficacy, with input from the RI-AIR Collaborative, an established group of key stakeholders involved in the care of children with asthma in the state.

"Text2Breathe: Enhance Parent Communication to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases, such as asthma, disproportionately affect African American (AA) children. A key recommendation of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma is partnership between healthcare providers and patients (and their parents, for children). Facilitating parents' open communication with providers regarding healthcare status and concerns can equip them to more effectively partner with their child's primary care provider (PCP). Thus, improving the health communication skills of African American (AA) parents could improve parent's adherence to treatment recommendations including utilization of the primary care for asthma care, and ultimately improve their child's asthma health outcomes. Our team recently completed a randomized controlled trial of an in- person health communication intervention that resulted in more partnerships with PCPs for asthma care and lower urgent care usage, but effects were not sustained past 2 months post-intervention. Mobile technology, such as Short Message Service (SMS, ""text messaging""), is a low-cost means of extending the dosage and scope of this intervention and may be particularly useful among AAs, for whom the use of SMS is widespread. The proposed study involves a SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention (Text2Breathe) designed to equip urban, low-income AA parents with tools/techniques to empower parents to more effectively communicate with their children's PCP. 268 AA parents of children attending an emergency department asthma education clinic will be randomized to usual care or Text2Breathe. The Text2Breathe group will receive ongoing individualized text messages providing instruction about asthma care communication during the year- long intervention period. Outcome data on parental self-efficacy and outcome expectations, adherence to asthma care treatment recommendations (e.g., primary care utilization), and child asthma outcomes will be collected via structured telephone interviews at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-enrollment. This trial can reduce pediatric health disparities by verifying the efficacy of a SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention that can extend to other chronic conditions and have health and policy implications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this text messaging intervention is to equip African American parents to effectively communicate with primary care providers about their child's asthma care needs. Increasing parents' self-efficacy is expected to enhance their adherence to treatment recommendations, specifically utilization of primary care and self- management, and thus improve children's asthma health outcomes. Results of the trial of this intervention can have broad impact on reducing pediatric health disparities because, if efficacious, this SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention can be extended to other chronic disease contexts where parent- provider communication is important.",Text2Breathe: Enhance Parent Communication to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities,9744234,R01MD007740,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Sex- Based Differences in Airway Structural Properties and Immune Response in HDM Challenged Animals ABSTRACT Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are lung diseases caused by exaggerated lung inflammation in response to exposure to chemical pollutants. These inflammatory responses lead to airway obstruction and ultimately compromised airflow. Both asthma and COPD are highly prevalent diseases that affect women disproportionally. Over 25 million (or 1 in 12 Americans) have asthma, a number that is steadily on the rise, and its morbidity for females has been reported to be at least 62% higher than males. Similarly, COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide, affecting over 7 billion individuals, and its mortality rate has been steadily rising for the past two decades, especially in women. A definitive link between long term exposure to ambient air pollution and the development of lung disease has been difficult to determine as multiple confounding variables have been observed in longitudinal studies attempting to examine this correlation. However, the direct effect of specific air pollutants on promoting the development of these airway diseases, and the causes of the observed gender disparities in their prevalence have not been elucidated. Environmental factors that have been shown to increase the risk of asthma and COPD include ozone, particulate matter, cigarette smoke, and allergens derived from cockroach, dust mite, mice, and rats. The impact of these factors, and the mechanisms involved in the observed sex disparities for both diseases remain unknown. To this end, our lab has recently challenged male and female C57/BL6 mice with a house dust mite (HDM) solution containing two HDM species, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae. Our preliminary findings showed alterations in respiratory mechanics and an up-regulation of immune responses that were different between male and female animals following HDM challenge. These models have recapitulated many of the pathologic characteristics observed in human asthma and COPD patients, including airway neutrophilia, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), compromised vascular barrier function and lower airway remodeling including emphysema. This indirect examination revealed sex differences in airway inflammation and remodeling. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the degree of inflammation and remodeling in HDM-challenged animals with a more objective and quantitative methodology, using two-photon microscopy techniques. With these, we may acquire a deeper understanding of the cell-specific effects of environmental exposures on male and female mice. We will also extend the characterization of the inflammatory response using flow cytometry in order to identify differences in metabolic state and phenotype of alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. The knowledge gained can be applied to models of ozone-induced lung inflammation. This information could lead to better diagnostic tests, individualized treatment options, and identification of sex-specific environmental and hormonal triggers that lead to severe lung disease symptoms. NARRATIVE There is a clear involvement of environmental components in the induction and exacerbation of respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary distress syndrome (COPD) and asthma. Disparities in sensitivity to these factors between males and females have been identified, but the structural basis of these differences have not been examined by complex imaging techniques. Here, we will use two-photon microscopy to identify changes that could lead to better diagnostic tests and individualized treatment options for patients with inflammatory lung disease, while identifying the environmental and hormonal triggers that lead to severe symptoms.",Sex- Based Differences in Airway Structural Properties and Immune Response in HDM Challenged

"Text2Breathe: Enhance Parent Communication to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases, such as asthma, disproportionately affect African American (AA) children. A key recommendation of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma is partnership between healthcare providers and patients (and their parents, for children). Facilitating parents' open communication with providers regarding healthcare status and concerns can equip them to more effectively partner with their child's primary care provider (PCP). Thus, improving the health communication skills of African American (AA) parents could improve parent's adherence to treatment recommendations including utilization of the primary care for asthma care, and ultimately improve their child's asthma health outcomes. Our team recently completed a randomized controlled trial of an in- person health communication intervention that resulted in more partnerships with PCPs for asthma care and lower urgent care usage, but effects were not sustained past 2 months post-intervention. Mobile technology, such as Short Message Service (SMS, ""text messaging""), is a low-cost means of extending the dosage and scope of this intervention and may be particularly useful among AAs, for whom the use of SMS is widespread. The proposed study involves a SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention (Text2Breathe) designed to equip urban, low-income AA parents with tools/techniques to empower parents to more effectively communicate with their children's PCP. 268 AA parents of children attending an emergency department asthma education clinic will be randomized to usual care or Text2Breathe. The Text2Breathe group will receive ongoing individualized text messages providing instruction about asthma care communication during the year- long intervention period. Outcome data on parental self-efficacy and outcome expectations, adherence to asthma care treatment recommendations (e.g., primary care utilization), and child asthma outcomes will be collected via structured telephone interviews at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-enrollment. This trial can reduce pediatric health disparities by verifying the efficacy of a SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention that can extend to other chronic conditions and have health and policy implications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this text messaging intervention is to equip African American parents to effectively communicate with primary care providers about their child's asthma care needs. Increasing parents' self-efficacy is expected to enhance their adherence to treatment recommendations, specifically utilization of primary care and self- management, and thus improve children's asthma health outcomes.

"Using a Spatio-Temporal Framework to Understand Disparities in Pediatric Asthma Emergency Department Visits: a Case Study in South Carolina ABSTRACT: Asthma is the leading chronic pediatric disease in the US, making it a serious and costly public health issue. Children are hospitalized due to asthma for a variety of reasons such as environmental factors and patterns in healthcare. Asthma hospitalizations also exhibit large disparities across many socio-environmental factors. Much can still be learned and there has been little research contrasting disparities across different contextual factors, especially rural/urban. Furthermore, geographical factors are well-known determinants of health disparities and thus a clearer picture of the role that “place” has in the asthma burden could better elucidate risk factors and their synergistic effects, which can lead to improved interventions to address disparities. Spatial epidemiology provides a unique pathway to support this mission as improved assessment of risk factors over space and time can improve public health strategies for addressing disparities in this complex disease. The overarching goal of this research is to improve understanding of neighborhood and environmental risk factors driving disparities in pediatric asthma ED visits. The primary hypothesis for this proposal is that disparities in such risk factors will associate with asthma-related health disparities in children and that these associations will be modified by characteristics of place. To address this, we will employ innovative Bayesian statistical methodologies to analyze highly resolved spatio-temporal data comprised of health outcomes, demographic information, and environmental measures from South Carolina. Our first aim is to identify the spatio-temporal health disparity patterns in pediatric asthma. Our second aim is to quantify the long-term drivers of asthma disparities. Finally, the third aim is to quantify the short term drivers of asthma disparities in an acute health effects framework. The immediate impacts of this work will identify, disaggregate, and rank the factors that contribute to asthma ED visit disparities across many socio- environmental factors, notably urban/rural disparities. This project will refine estimates of environmental exposures and known risk factors of pediatric asthma ED visits, and their interactive effects. The long-term impacts will advance the epidemiologic analysis of disparities in pediatric asthma, a complex and multifactorial disease that has proven challenging to study with existing methods. The research will inform future case- control and cohort research designs of the importance for both collecting and analyzing highly precise spatio- temporal data to better detail health disparities. Furthermore, this research will generate tangible location- specific evidence to direct interventions to reduce disparities in ED visits and their heavy human and financial costs, which could then be used to assess the effectiveness of forthcoming telehealth interventions in improving health trajectories and outcomes among vulnerable children.

"Social adversities and asthma: a new phenotype? ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a common and challenging disease of childhood that disproportionately affects poor minority populations. These populations also experience an excess of social adversities, which are important risk factors for asthma morbidity. However, the response to these adversities is variable: poverty increases the odds of asthma in African Americans, yet decreases it in Mexican Americans. Thus, there is a knowledge gap in our ability to identify individuals vulnerable to social adversities and truly at high-risk for poor asthma outcomes. I am seeking a Mentored NIH K23 Career Development Award to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading, independent researcher in asthma health outcomes. To move towards this goal, my overall objective for this award is to identify disadvantaged minority children at risk for poor asthma outcomes. My central hypothesis is a profile of demographic, social, and environmental characteristics coupled with stress-related biomarkers will predict which individuals are at high risk for poor asthma outcomes, and that this profile will vary by race/ethnicity. This will be testd with the following three aims. Specific Aim 1: Estimate the association between social adversities at individual- and community-levels with asthma susceptibility and morbidity. Social adversities have been identified from administered questionnaire, and geocoded census data obtained from personal address history through a cross-sectional study of 6200 children with and without asthma. Specific Aim 2: Examine if social adversities are associated with biomarkers of stress that may influence asthma susceptibility and morbidity. Stress-related biomarkers will be measured and a link between the biomarkers and asthma outcomes will be examined separately in African American and Latino children. Specific Aim 3: Identify a phenotype susceptible to social adversities and examine how it modifies the course of asthma using a longitudinal approach. A phenotype, or type of asthma, associated with social adversities amongst those with asthma will be identified. Participants with the identified phenotype will be recruited from the original study and followed to understand how this asthma type behaves over time in the presence of social adversities. This proposal will result in identifying an asthma phenotype that will allows us to target individuals at high-risk for poor asthma outcomes related to social adversities. This contribution is significant as utilizing stress related biomarkers may allow us to better risk stratify individuals and, potentially, capture them prior to adverse health outcomes occurring. A multi-disciplinary mentoring committee with diverse expertise: asthma (Drs. Burchard, Cabana), health disparities research (Drs. Burchard, Bibbins-Domingo, Cabana), biostatistics (Dr. Sen), and implementation sciences (Drs. Cattamanchi, Ackerman), will guide the progress of the research agenda. Their mentorship, as well as a focused training and research plan facilitated by a K23 award, will develop my expertise in health disparities research in asthma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American and Latino children experience an excess of poor asthma outcomes and social adversities. We are limited in our ability to identify the individuals who are the most susceptible to social adversities. With this proposal, a phenotype of asthma will be identified that will better discriminate individuals at high risk for poor asthma outcomes. This will allow for the development and application of targeted interventions designed to minimize the effect of social adversities and, thus, improve asthma outcomes in vulnerable populations.",Social adversities and asthma: a new phenotype?,9392932,K23HL125551,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' Influentials ', ' Lipids ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Poverty ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate ', ' Prasterone Sulfate ', ' Dehydroisoandrosterone Sulfate ', ' DHEA Sulfate ', ' DHA Sulfate ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' GALA ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' pulmonary function ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' experience ', ' income insurance ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' minority children ', ' recruit ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2018,205219,0.4590780589726761

"ACTION Intervention: Physical Activity in Minority Women with Asthma ABSTRACT Asthma is a highly prevalent chronic disease that disproportionately impacts African American (AA) women. AA women have poorer asthma-related quality of life and higher rates of asthma exacerbations, healthcare utilization and mortality compared to Caucasian women. Further, AA women are less physically active than any other subgroup of adults, which may help explain the asthma health disparities, found between AA and Caucasian women. Physical inactivity among individuals with asthma is associated with poor asthma control and respiratory function, greater health care utilization, and poorer quality of life. Given the connection between poor asthma outcomes and physical inactivity, addressing physical activity (PA) among sedentary AA women with asthma is imperative. Physical activity demonstrated improvement in asthma outcomes specifically asthma control, quality of life and healthcare utilization. Despite these benefits, fewer than 25% of AA women with asthma engage in regular physical activity. The ACTION intervention: physicAl aCtiviTy In minOrity womeN with asthma is a 8-month community-based walking intervention refined to be applicable for sedentary AA women with asthma. This application proposes to obtain and incorporate stakeholder input on the barriers and facilitators to engaging in physical activity with asthma to a validated community-based walking intervention. Once modified, we will pre-pilot the intervention in 10 participants, refine further in response to participant feedback and then test the feasibility, acceptability and estimate the efficacy of the intervention in a randomized controlled pilot of 80 participants within a pragmatic community setting convenient for sedentary AA women. Through coursework, hands-on experience and strong mentorship this project will provide the dedicated candidate with the necessary skills to become an independent investigator and build an impactful research program on designing and implementing health promotion interventions to improve asthma outcomes in minority populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Physical inactivity in asthma is associated with worse asthma outcomes and African American women are disproportionately impacted by both physical inactivity and asthma. Research aimed at addressing the unique asthma-related and cultural-specific barriers to physical activity in this vulnerable population of women is needed. The proposed study will modify a validated community-based walking intervention specific to the needs of sedentary African American women with asthma and evaluate the impact of the intervention on physical activity and asthma specific indicators to reduce the burden of asthma in sedentary African American women.  ",ACTION Intervention: Physical Activity in Minority Women with Asthma,9705904,K01HL133370,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Interview ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Physicians ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Safety ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Walking ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Moderate Exercise ', ' moderate physical activity ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Modification ', ' cost ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' community safety ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' community setting ', ' public health priorities ', ' power analysis ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ', ' exercise intervention ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' exercise regimen ', ' Exercise routine ', ' walking intervention ', ' recruit ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' asthma attack ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,K01,2019,185155,0.3399383224865739
"BACKGROUND: Bettering Asthma Care in Kids - Geographic Social Determinants Data to Understand Disparities Project Summary/Abstract  Latino children with asthma have worse outcomes from their asthma than non-Hispanic white children. In the medical literature, the degree to which these outcomes are the result of limited access, underutilization, poor quality of care, or social & environmental factors is unclear. A fuller understanding of asthma outcomes in Latino children is hampered by scientific evidence that has relied upon cross-sectional studies with a limited time capture, or subjective surveys vulnerable to response biases. Additionally, some evidence in the health services literature suggests that social determinants of health (individual- and community-level economic, social, and environmental factors), including Hispanic subgroup (Mexican ancestry, Puerto Rican ancestry, etc) affect asthma care and outcomes. It is uncertain, however, which social determinants are most strongly associated with Latino children's asthma care.  The proposed project intends to fill these gaps in knowledge regarding the nature of asthma care disparities in Latino children and the relative contribution of social determinants of health to these disparities, by utilizing an objective, longitudinal, and robust linkage of data sources encompassing thousands of vulnerable children across multiple states. We will leverage a unique data resource from a large, national network of community health centers with shared electronic health record data that is linked to community-level social determinants of health data. This large, longitudinal dataset contains unprecedented data linkages which will let us assess disparities in asthma care, evaluate which social determinants affect utilization and disparities, and determine which of these may do so most significantly over time. We will also specifically develop methods to use community Hispanic subgroup information to estimate the individual subgroups of patient seen in our clinics (which is information not usually present in electronic health records), and how preventive service use differs among these groups  Understanding the relative impact of social determinants of health on asthma care in Latino children will: 1. Enable more informed policy decisions to improve the care of this vulnerable population, 2. facilitate strategic partnerships between healthcare providers and community agencies poised to intervene in social factors in the lives of Latino children, and 3. help clinical providers understand their patients' barriers to care utilization, and further point-of-care efforts to address the barriers that influence children's utilization of recommended health care services for their asthma. Project Narrative  Latino children with asthma have worse outcomes from their condition than non-Hispanic whites. Many demographic and social factors affect the health care of these children, but it is unknown which specific factors most significantly affect the care provided. This project will use a highly innovative, linked database that combines electronic health care data and community information to better understand which factors, including Hispanic subgroup, most heavily affect the care utilized by Latino children with asthma.",BACKGROUND: Bettering Asthma Care in Kids - Geographic Social Determinants Data to Understand Disparities,9720714,R01MD011404,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Affect ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' child healthcare ', ' Child health care ', ' Communities ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Geography ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Mexican ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' preference ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' health data ', ' asthmatic ', ' built environment ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' data resource ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' patient barriers ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' Migrant ', ' ']",NIMHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,481150,0.24659028218487994
"The effects of a housing mobility program on home environmental and host airway microbiota and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma morbidity is a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods, and contributors to asthma disparities may include home environmental exposures to biotic material. While allergens and endotoxin have been studied extensively, less is known about the role of bacterial and fungal communities, about the upstream influence of environmental microbiota on airway microbiota, and about the downstream contributions of airway microbiota to asthma morbidity. Therefore, we will take advantage of a natural experiment to understand whether changes in microbiota occur in children who move from high-poverty, urban neighborhoods to low-poverty neighborhoods, primarily in the suburbs, through the Baltimore Housing Mobility Program (BHMP), the nation's largest mobility program. We will leverage existing support for a prospective cohort study of children with asthma and their families enrolled through BHMP to evaluate the hypothesis that moving to a low-poverty neighborhood through a housing mobility program will result in changes in home microbial exposures (bacterial and fungal communities). We further hypothesize that changes in the microbial composition and diversity of home exposures will be linked to alterations in microbial composition of the child's airway and improvements in asthma, controlling for changes in other biotic pollutants. Through prospectively evaluating 5-17 year old children with persistent asthma and their home environments before and after they and their families move with the support of BHMP, we seek to address the following specific aims: 1) To assess the effects of moving from a high-poverty urban neighborhood to a low-poverty suburban neighborhood on home and child airway microbiota, and 2) To explore the influence of changes in home dust and child airway microbiota on asthma outcomes. The proposed study's findings will provide new insights into environmental causes of asthma disparities and greater understanding of how changes in home environmental and child airway microbiota may influence asthma morbidity among low-income children. NARRATIVE Asthma morbidity is a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods, and an emerging literature points to a potential significant role for microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) in asthma. Geographic differences in home environmental microbiota have been demonstrated between urban and suburban communities, suggesting the strong potential that these differences could be involved in asthma disparities. By evaluating children with established asthma who move from a high-poverty urban neighborhood to a low-poverty suburban neighborhood with their families given the support of the nation's largest housing mobility program, our work will contribute critical evidence to identify the upstream role of environmental microbiota on host microbiota, and to explore the downstream role of host airway microbiota on the trajectory of allergic asthma in a high-risk population. !",The effects of a housing mobility program on home environmental and host airway microbiota and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children,9710589,R21AI133492,"['Allergens ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Bacteria ', ' Baltimore ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Endotoxins ', ' Family ', ' fungus ', ' Geography ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Hygiene ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' IgE ', ' Literature ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Extrinsic asthma ', ' extrinsic allergic asthma ', ' atopic asthma ', ' Allergic asthma ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' Family Study ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' insight ', ' Rural ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Exhalation ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' House Dust ', ' household dust ', ' home dust ', ' Housedust ', ' interest ', ' Farming environment ', ' farm environment ', ' Farm ', ' inner city ', ' pollutant ', ' microbial ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 years of age ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' household environmental exposure ', ' home environmental exposure ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' urban poverty ', ' built environment ', ' microbiota ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' microflora ', ' microbial flora ', ' microbial consortia ', ' minority children ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' suburban communities ', ' urban setting ', ' recruit ', ' host microbiota ', ' resident microflora ', ' resident microbes ', ' host microflora ', ' respiratory microbiota ', ' airway microbiota ', ' airway microbial community ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,198964,0.29528110955243425
"West Philadelphia Asthma Care Implementation Plan Project Summary/Abstract:  The Community Asthma Prevention Program (CAPP) has a two-decade history of utilizing CHWs to improve asthma outcomes of children in Philadelphia. Building on this foundation, we established a network of stakeholders, The West Philadelphia Asthma Care Collaborative (WEPACC), with representation from public housing, healthcare, community, and schools. As a result of assessment of local needs, resource mapping, and months of planning, we designed an asthma care implementation program with the broad objective of integrating home, school, healthcare system, and community for school-aged asthmatic children in West Philadelphia. We will accomplish this goal using CHWs to deliver sustainable patient-centered evidence- based interventions. The evidence-based interventions include (1) a primary care-based Yes We Can intervention with home visitation and (2) a comprehensive and rigorously evaluated school-based intervention, Open Airways for schools and School Based Asthma Therapy. CHWs will function as the hub of each interventions, serving either as primary care CHWs or school CHWs to provide a network of education, care coordination support, and to facilitate communication for families of children with asthma between the four sectors. This project is innovative in that it seeks to integrate interventions in a comprehensive and sustainable manner to reduce asthma disparities in poor, minority children.  Using a factorial design, we will recruit and randomize 600 asthmatic children (ages 6-12 years) from three inner-city primary care clinics who attend one of 23 West Philadelphia schools to one of four study conditions: both interventions (both primary care and school CHWs intervention), primary care CHW or school- CHW alone, or control and follow for one year. We will accomplish the following objectives: Specific Aim 1. Compare effectiveness of the primary care and school interventions to improve asthma control and reduce symptom days using main and simple effects from the factorial design. Specific Aim 2. Explore moderators and mechanisms of effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions. Specific Aim 3. Use mixed methods to explore implementation determinants and outcomes of school intervention that promote effectiveness, fidelity and sustainability Specific Aim 4. Examine the costs, savings, and cost effectiveness associated with the intervention and implementation strategies to promote sustainability 1 Project Narrative: This project uses community health workers or lay health educators to implement asthma interventions that have been proven to work in order to connect the caregiver, community, school and health sectors.

"Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication and Social Adversity (ASTHMA) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Pediatric asthma has a substantial public health burden with numerous contributing risk factors in the physical, social, and health care environments. This burden is elevated among low-income minority children living in urban areas, related in part to multi-factorial residential exposures. There are numerous complex feedback loops among risk factors, with interventions potentially inducing behavioral responses that modify levels of other risk factors. Given these characteristics, pediatric asthma is an ideal candidate for systems science tools to prioritize among risk factors and design intervention strategies. However, there have been few applications of systems science techniques to asthma, and no applications to date that take account of multiple risk factors with housing, social and behavioral components. Discrete event simulation (DES), a systems science approach that involves modeling a complex system in which individuals can be tracked over time, multiple attributes can be incorporated simultaneously, and interactions and non-linear effects can be incorporated, is ideally suited for this application. This project (the Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication, and Social Adversity - ASTHMA) builds upon the only DES model of pediatric asthma or the physical environment, leveraging data from a longstanding electronic health record (EHR) database, and extensive neighborhood contextual data available from a BU center of environmental health disparities. Building on prior expertise and the strength of an established interdisciplinary team we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: To build the Boston Children’s Healthcare Disparities Repository (BCHDR), a large database of predominantly low-income and racial/ethnic minority asthmatic children extracted from the BMC EHR, and use it to develop associations among key predictors of lung function, medication prescription and adherence, social adversity, asthma outcomes, and healthcare utilization. Aim 2: To predict exposure to indoor pollutants and environmental conditions across a range of housing types, resident behaviors, and sociodemographic characteristics, in a manner useful for DES modeling. Aim 3: To expand the existing DES model to capture the variability in housing, sociodemographic, and neighborhood environments for asthmatic children in the BCHDR, and evaluate the influence of implemented or proposed policies addressing housing conditions, medication adherence, and aspects of social adversity on asthma outcomes. These data and methods collectively allow us to develop unique insights about the individual and cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on asthma outcomes, as well as about how candidate interventions would influence asthma outcomes given the multiple pathways and complex behavioral responses. While we focus on data specific to Boston to ensure internal consistency, our methods and insights will generalize to other urban settings, our housing modeling approach can be expanded to any are in the US, and our discrete event simulation code and methodology for extracting and analyzing clinical and social risk factor data from an EHR could be adapted to other circumstances. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication, and Social Adversity (ASTHMA) will yield a simulation model that can characterize the effects of indoor environmental exposures, social risk factors, medication adherence, and neighborhood contextual factors on asthma outcomes among low-income children. ASTHMA will incorporate indoor air quality models, building simulations, statistical models using medical and social adversity data from electronic health records, and GIS derived neighborhood contextual variables, with sufficient data to characterize feedback loops and interactions among risk factors. We will develop insight about how candidate interventions – related to housing construction and management, community, individual, and public housing policies – in low-income housing can influence chemical exposures, social stressors, and corresponding health outcomes.","Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication and Social Adversity (ASTHMA)",9724468,R01ES027816,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' Boston ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' child healthcare ', ' Child health care ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' Humidity ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' Publishing ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Ventilation ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' Measures ', ' Indoor Air Quality ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' stressor ', ' pollutant ', ' Structure ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Published Database ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Department of Energy ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' community intervention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' intervention effect ', ' simulation software ', ' Indoor pollutant ', ' asthmatic ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' model building ', ' minority children ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' fine particles ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' PM2.5 ', ' data resource ', ' urban setting ', ' violence exposure ', ' exposure to violence ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' asthma attack ', ' ']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,489385,0.30352371910305587
"Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management - Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP) In the US, children from minority ethnic and racial backgrounds suffer disproportionately from asthma. Despite well established guidelines, under-treatment for asthma is common, especially for poor and minority populations. Our prior work has demonstrated that school-based directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medications can improve outcomes for poor, urban children with persistent asthma. We have also found that school-based telemedicine can effectively facilitate assessments by primary care providers (PCPs) for preventive medication prescriptions for DOT and for follow-up care. However, to our concern we have found that children do not benefit equally from our programs. Specifically, among the subgroup of children with moderate to severe persistent or difficult to control asthma at baseline, the majority did not achieve control despite these school-based interventions. In fact, despite telemedicine follow-up assessments with PCP prompting for guideline-based step-ups in treatments, many of these children remained under-treated. We realize that our existing programs may be insufficient for these children, since they do not include specialist consultation for optimization of medication management or for identification and treatment of co-morbid conditions and triggers. Importantly, specialist care is substantially underutilized by poor and minority children who bear the greatest morbidity burden from asthma, leading to inconsistent delivery of guideline-based treatments and continued disparities. In response to PAR-15-279, we propose an innovative school-based program for urban children with moderate to severe persistent or difficult to control asthma. The Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management-Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP) program enhances our school-based, primary care directed asthma program with specialist-supported care to ensure optimal guideline-based treatment. We propose a randomized trial of TEAM-UP versus an enhanced care comparison group. We will prompt PCPs of all enrolled children (n=360, 4-12 years) to initiate school-based DOT of preventive asthma medication and will recommend referral to an asthma specialist. For children in TEAM-UP, the specialist visits will be facilitated via telemedicine at school. The initial telemedicine specialist visit will be scheduled after 4 weeks of DOT, in order to allow for accurate guideline-based assessments of medication and care needs once adherence with a daily controller medication is established. There will also be 2 telemedicine follow-up specialist visits to assess the child's response to treatment and make needed adjustments. We will capitalize on the existing community infrastructure by implementing both telemedicine and DOT in schools, and maintaining collaboration with the PCP. We will assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of TEAM-UP in reducing morbidity and improving guideline-based care (primary outcome: symptom-free days at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) versus enhanced care. At the study's completion, the program will be better defined as a sustainable means to improve care and reduce morbidity for high risk children with difficult to control asthma. NARRATIVE - RELEVANCE This project is expected to have a profound impact on public health because it proposes an innovative intervention, built from our previously successful school-based programs, to address gaps in the care of children at highest risk for poor asthma outcomes.

"Disparities in Sleep, Asthma, and the Sleep Context in Urban Children Project Summary / Abstract Pediatric health disparities in the areas of asthma and sleep persist; asthma and poor sleep outcomes are prevalent among ethnic minority and urban children. Known stressors of urban poverty and poorly controlled asthma can adversely impact the sleep health of urban children with asthma. Our work with urban children with persistent asthma has shown that Latino and African American (AA) children are exposed to sociocontextual (e.g., neighborhood stress, allergens/irritants) and cultural (e.g., acculturative stress) risks that challenge asthma management and increase asthma morbidity. Further, our recently completed study indicates real-time links among asthma, sleep quality, and daytime functioning in urban children. The roles of sleep context, daily sleep routines, and sleep behaviors of urban children of specific ethnic groups are unknown. Our work has focused on contributors to asthma health disparities, assessing sleep quality in this group with actigraphy and self-report sleep behavior measures. Cultural, sleep, and asthma-specific factors in children's sleep contexts can affect children's maintenance of healthy sleep behaviors, and in turn, asthma morbidity. Sleep timing and circadian measures have not been assessed in these groups. Targeting the sleep setting and sleep behaviors along with biological measures of underlying circadian timing in urban children with asthma has the potential to identify mechanisms to inform interventions to improve sleep and asthma outcomes.  We propose to utilize a multi-method, in-depth approach to characterize the sleep patterns and sleep settings of urban children in combination with biological measures that may differ based on children's ethnic group background and may contribute to asthma outcomes. We will enroll 240 urban children (ages 7-9, from Latino, AA, and Non-Latino White backgrounds) with persistent asthma and their primary caregivers. Each child/caregiver will participate in a 16- day protocol involving an assessment of the child's sleep context, sleep status (by actigraphy; ambulatory polysomnography, PSG; saliva for dim light melatonin onset, DLMO), and asthma status (lung function by home spirometry, immune biomarker assessment, report of symptoms/control). The sleep context will be examined through our environmental walk-through assessment, in-depth caregiver/child interviews, and self-report assessments, and objective measurement of light during monitoring.  The first aim of the study is to examine ethnic differences in sleep patterns, with a focus on such outcomes as timing (e.g., night-to-night variability in time to bed), continuity (e.g., nighttime arousals), and length (sleep duration) measured across 16 days with actigraphy, as well as circadian phase (DLMO) and alignment of sleep timing to circadian phase. The second aim involves examining ethnic differences in the co- occurrence of sleep status and asthma status. The third aim will identify sleep-related (e.g., sleep disruptors), asthma (e.g., availability/location of rescue medication), and cultural-related (e.g., sleep beliefs) risk and resource factors of children's sleep context that moderate associations between sleep and asthma outcomes. Project Narrative: Pediatric health disparities in the areas of asthma and sleep persist; asthma and poor sleep outcomes are prevalent among ethnic minority and urban children. Known stressors of urban poverty and poorly controlled asthma can adversely impact the sleep health of urban children with asthma. Our work with urban children with persistent asthma has shown that Latino and African American (AA) children are exposed to sociocontextual and cultural risks that challenge asthma management and increase asthma morbidity. Further, our recently completed study indicates real-time links among asthma, sleep quality, and daytime functioning in urban children. We find that urban Latino and AA children with asthma are at greater risk for poor sleep health compared to healthy peers and their non-Latino white (NLW) counterparts with asthma; Latino children are at the highest level of risk likely due to increased morbidity as well as urban and cultural stressors that can complicate asthma management and healthy sleep behaviors. The roles of sleep context, daily sleep routines, and sleep behaviors of urban children of specific ethnic groups are unknown. Sleep timing and circadian measures also have not been assessed in these groups. The proposed research will address two objectives in a sample of urban children (7-9 years old) with persistent asthma: To examine 1) ethnic differences in sleep patterns including sleep outcomes assessing timing, continuity, and length, as well as biological measures of circadian timing, and their co-occurrence with asthma status, and 2) sleep-, asthma- and cultural-related risk and resource factors relevant to children's sleep context that may moderate the association between sleep status and asthma status. We will utilize a multi-method, in-depth approach to characterize the sleep patterns and sleep settings of urban children in combination with biological measures that may differ based on children's ethnic group background and may contribute to asthma outcomes. We will enroll 240 urban children (ages 7-9, from Latino, AA, and NLW backgrounds) with persistent asthma and their primary caregivers. Each child/caregiver will participate in a 16- day protocol involving an assessment of the child's sleep context, sleep status (by actigraphy; ambulatory polysomnography, saliva for dim light melatonin onset), and asthma status (lung function by home spirometry, immune biomarker assessment, report of symptoms/control). The sleep context will be examined through our environmental walk-through assessment, in-depth interviews, and self- report assessments, and objective measurement of light during monitoring. Assessing the role of potential risks and resources of the sleep setting and sleep behaviors that may challenge or enhance sleep outcomes, along with biological measures of underlying circadian timing in urban children with asthma has the potential to identify mechanisms to inform interventions to improve sleep health and asthma outcomes.","Disparities in Sleep, Asthma, and the Sleep Context in Urban Children",9742691,R01HL142058,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Allergens ', ' Arousal ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Beds ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Crowding ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Irritants ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maintenance ', ' Melatonin ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Saliva ', ' Sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' poor sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Spirometry ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' immunological markers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' Polysomnography ', ' sleep polysomnography ', ' sleep measurement ', ' polysomnographic ', ' Somnography ', ' Sleep Monitoring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Exposure to ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Location ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' 9 year old ', ' nine years of age ', ' nine year old ', ' age 9 years ', ' 9 years of age ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' sleep position ', ' urban poverty ', ' primary caregiver ', ' primary care giver ', ' urban children ', ' minority children ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' urban setting ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' sleep health ', ' sleep hygiene ', ' circadian ', ' sleep behavior ', ' sleep habit ', ' sleep pattern ', ' ']",NHLBI,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2019,749997,0.17962004086534678
"Sex-Based Differences in Airway Structural Properties and Immune Response in HDM Challenged Animals ABSTRACT Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are lung diseases caused by exaggerated lung inflammation in response to exposure to chemical pollutants. These inflammatory responses lead to airway obstruction and ultimately compromised airflow. Both asthma and COPD are highly prevalent diseases that affect women disproportionally. Over 25 million (or 1 in 12 Americans) have asthma, a number that is steadily on the rise, and its morbidity for females has been reported to be at least 62% higher than males. Similarly, COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide, affecting over 7 billion individuals, and its mortality rate has been steadily rising for the past two decades, especially in women. A definitive link between long term exposure to ambient air pollution and the development of lung disease has been difficult to determine as multiple confounding variables have been observed in longitudinal studies attempting to examine this correlation. However, the direct effect of specific air pollutants on promoting the development of these airway diseases, and the causes of the observed gender disparities in their prevalence have not been elucidated. Environmental factors that have been shown to increase the risk of asthma and COPD include ozone, particulate matter, cigarette smoke, and allergens derived from cockroach, dust mite, mice, and rats. The impact of these factors, and the mechanisms involved in the observed sex disparities for both diseases remain unknown. To this end, our lab has recently challenged male and female C57/BL6 mice with a house dust mite (HDM) solution containing two HDM species, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae. Our preliminary findings showed alterations in respiratory mechanics and an up-regulation of immune responses that were different between male and female animals following HDM challenge. These models have recapitulated many of the pathologic characteristics observed in human asthma and COPD patients, including airway neutrophilia, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), compromised vascular barrier function and lower airway remodeling including emphysema. This indirect examination revealed sex differences in airway inflammation and remodeling. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the degree of inflammation and remodeling in HDM-challenged animals with a more objective and quantitative methodology, using two-photon microscopy techniques. With these, we may acquire a deeper understanding of the cell-specific effects of environmental exposures on male and female mice. We will also extend the characterization of the inflammatory response using flow cytometry in order to identify differences in metabolic state and phenotype of alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. The knowledge gained can be applied to models of ozone-induced lung inflammation. This information could lead to better diagnostic tests, individualized treatment options, and identification of sex-specific environmental and hormonal triggers that lead to severe lung disease symptoms. NARRATIVE There is a clear involvement of environmental components in the induction and exacerbation of respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary distress syndrome (COPD) and asthma. Disparities in sensitivity to these factors between males and females have been identified, but the structural basis of these differences have not been examined by complex imaging techniques. Here, we will use two-photon microscopy to identify changes that could lead to better diagnostic tests and individualized treatment options for patients with inflammatory lung disease, while identifying the environmental and hormonal triggers that lead to severe symptoms.",Sex-Based Differences in Airway Structural Properties and Immune Response in HDM Challenged Animals,9849884,R03HL141618,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' airway obstruction ', ' obstructed airway ', ' obstructed airflow ', ' airflow obstruction ', ' Allergens ', ' Animal Experimentation ', ' Animal Research ', ' Animal Experimental Use ', ' Animals ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cockroaches ', ' Dictyoptera ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Marrow Eosinophil ', ' Eosinophilic Leukocyte ', ' Eosinophilic Granulocyte ', ' Blood Eosinophil ', ' eosinophil ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Female ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Inducer T-Lymphocytes ', ' Inducer Cells ', ' Helper-Inducer T-Cells ', ' Helper T-Lymphocytes ', ' Helper T-Cells ', ' Helper Cells ', ' Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' macrophage ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Improving Patient-Centered Outcomes after Discharge among Patients Hospitalized with Asthma Exacerbations by Focusing on a Transition-to-Home Plan with Community Health Workers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic disease, affecting more than 10% of American children (>7 million children <18 years)1 and disproportionately impacting urban, minority, and disadvantaged children.2 Despite the evidence-based guidelines for standardized care from the NIH,3 overall morbidity among youth with asthma, whether measured by attack rates, emergency department (ED) visits, or hospitalizations, has not significantly decreased in the last decade.4 Striking disparities persist among youth with asthma, as socio- economically disadvantaged, urban, and minority children throughout the United States incur a disproportionate share of asthma-related morbidity.2,5 The overall ED visit rate for asthma, for example, among non-Hispanic African Americans (AAs) aged 0-17 years is 4.1 times greater than that among non-Hispanic whites, while the ED visit rate among Hispanics in the same age group is 1.8 times greater than non-Hispanic whites. Similarly, the asthma death rate among non-Hispanic AAs aged 0-17 years is 7.3 times greater than that among non-Hispanic whites, while the death rate among Hispanics in the same age group is 1.2 times greater than non-Hispanic whites.5 In a recent study to prioritize comparative effectiveness research in hospital pediatrics, asthma ranked as the #1 leading non-surgical diagnose for pediatric hospital admission, totaling costs of $570 million annually.6 Of striking importance for the health care system is that asthma is also in the top diagnoses for all-cause readmissions, with 80% of these asthma readmissions deemed potentially preventable readmissions.7 In this career training award, with a strong mentorship team, I propose a highly patient-centered approach to identifying and improving optimal outcomes for patients and families transitioning home after inpatient admissions for asthma exacerbations. Using the care coordination framework proposed by the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in June 2014,8 my mentors and I will utilize principles of patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) and comparative effectiveness research (CER) to design and pilot a program of community health worker (CHW)-facilitated transition-to-home focusing on the changeover of care from inpatient to outpatient for patients hospitalized with asthma exacerbation. This project is highly significant (addressing a vulnerable transition for patients admitted with a common and costly pediatric chronic illness with high rate of preventable readmissions) and highly innovative (using a qualitative approach to identify stakeholders' perspectives to refine AHRQ's care coordination framework to improve the transition from hospital to home by utilizing CHW and pilot testing feasibility and acceptability, and patient-centered outcomes). Our overall aim is to develop and evaluate a patient-centered transition-to-home plan leveraging CHWs to target high risk pediatric patients requiring hospital admission for asthma exacerbations. Our hypothesis is that CHWs will improve patient-centered outcomes during the transition from inpatient to outpatient care.

"Pediatric Asthma Disparities: The Role of Sleep and Immune Balance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K24 application proposes a mentorship program in patient-oriented research in multi-level contributors to pediatric asthma health disparities, wih a focus on sleep and immune balance. The K24 Candidate is an Associate Professor (Research) in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior of the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, with a history of funding in behavioral interventions and longitudinal research aimed at improving asthma outcomes in urban children and addressing health disparities in pediatric asthma. Training Plan: The candidate will obtain additional training in asthma clinical immunology and sleep physiology, including state-of the art methods to assess immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep, and in-lab methods to assess sleep phenomenology through experimental approaches. Research Plan: The research proposed involves an innovative investigation of the effects of experimental sleep disruption on immune balance (Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio-Th1/Th2R; plasma IL-6 -pIL-6), and associated changes in asthma- related lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) and daytime performance in urban children with persistent asthma (8-10 years old). Forty children and their primary caregiver will each participate in a within-subjects protocol, with two experimental sleep conditions: baseline sleep (1 overnight, in-lab polysomnographic (PSG) sleep study), followed by sleep fragmentation (1 overnight, in-lab PSG). Prior to each condition, children will follow a 6-day sleep stabilization schedule at home. We will monitor sleep and lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) daily to confirm eligibility and adherence to sleep criteria, and assess asthma status. We include assessments of immune biomarkers and daytime performance following each condition. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentoring Plan: The proposed mentoring plan offers opportunities for mentorship of postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty with interests in POR. Mentees will be involved in ongoing longitudinal and intervention studies on pediatric asthma disparities, including the proposed research, which will focus on biological-based processes that contribute to asthma and sleep in urban children. A strong emphasis is placed on the recruitment and selection of minority mentees. This overall plan capitalizes on the rich resources and training opportunities available to postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty at Brown Medical School, including several T32 fellowship programs, numerous junior faculty with K awards and small grants, a commitment to diversity in training, seminars in research design, ethics, and statistics, and an established infrastructure for evaluation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pediatric health disparities in the area of asthma and sleep continue to exist. Urban poverty and poorly controlled asthma can both adversely impact sleep quality by disrupting the continuity of nighttime sleep. Increased asthma symptoms and sleep disruption have each been linked with changes in immune balance. The immune imbalance associated with asthma in children may be greater in the context of sleep disruption, and this may adversely impact daytime functioning and increase inflammation that can bring on asthma symptoms. This K24 application will provide mentorship in patient-oriented research to post-doctoral fellows, residents, and junior faculty interested in multi-level contributing factors to disparities in pediatric asthma. The research proposed involves the implementation of an experimental approach to examine the effects of sleep disruption on immune imbalance, asthma-related lung function, and daytime performance in urban children (ages 8-10) with persistent, allergic asthma. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentorship goals involve providing training to post-doctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty, particularly those from minority backgrounds, in patient-oriented research focused on pediatric health disparities. The proposed career training activities to enhance knowledge and assessment of asthma clinical immunology and sleep physiology, will allow for more broadened opportunities for mentorship to trainees. In addition to the proposed research, mentees will be provided with multiple, ongoing opportunities for training in patient-oriented research on pediatric asthma health disparities.",Pediatric Asthma

"An Asthma Collaboration to Reduce Childhood Asthma Disparities on the Navajo Nation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Asthma prevalence among children on the Navajo Nation, the largest tribal reservation in the United States, is 2-3 times that of the general population and fueled by health disparities that include devastating poverty, multiple environmental pollutants, and large travel distances to obtain healthcare. Delivery of evidence-based asthma care through the Indian Health Service (IHS), the only healthcare system on the reservation, is inconsistent. While schools and communities identify pediatric asthma as a strong concern, no comprehensive asthma care implementation plan has been previously introduced. Therefore, this proposed study will combine two previously tested programs, one focused on training providers and one on school-based education and monitoring, to build a comprehensive, integrated, team-based Asthma Care Implementation Program to address medical care, family, home, and community to improve the health of Navajo children with asthma. A one-year engagement phase has resulted in strong support from Navajo Nation organizations including the President and Vice President of the Navajo Nation, governmental organizations, healthcare centers, schools, and communities in the three participating agencies (Fort Defiance, Chinle, and Tuba City). Approval of the proposed study by the Navajo Nation Human Research Review Board has been obtained. Key recommendations from communities including use of existing resources such as the Navajo Epidemiology Center, Navajo Health Department, local media, lay health workers, and ongoing involvement of stakeholders are included in this plan. Using a stepped-wedge design, the intervention will be introduced sequentially into three agencies. A mixed-methods analysis strategy will be employed that includes annual examination of asthma exacerbations through the IHS database (primary outcome), interviews with 300 families with a child with asthma, and key informant interviews with healthcare providers and school teachers and nurses. During the sustainability phase, meetings will be held with multiple organizations including local chapter houses to share outcome data, gather feedback, and plan for future dissemination to other agencies and reservations. The RE-AIM framework will be employed to evaluate the implementation process and facilitate dissemination to other tribal populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Asthma prevalence among children on the Navajo Nation, the largest tribal reservation in the United States, is 2-3 times that of the general population and fueled by disparities that include devastating poverty, multiple environmental pollutants, and large travel distances to obtain healthcare.

"Feelix@Home: A smart stethoscope to improve pediatric asthma management for urban minority families Project Summary  The goal of this project is to further develop an existing smart stethoscope in order to be capable of monitoring pediatric patients at home who suffer from asthma. Lung diseases impose a serious burden on healthcare systems, individuals and governments. WHO recognizes asthma as the leading chronic disease in children and estimates that 235 million people suffer from the disease worldwide, with over 380,000 deaths from the disease in 2015. In the United States, asthma prevalence and disease burden disproportionately affect Blacks or African-Americans compared with White Americans. From 2008 to 2010, the annual US asthma prevalence (11.9% for Black Americans versus 8.1% in Caucasians), mortality rate (0.23 versus 0.13 per 1000 patients per year), and emergency department visits (18.4 versus 6.1 visits per 100 patients per year) were all worse among Blacks or African-Americans. The fundamental causes of health disparities in relation to asthma are well understood (urban air pollution, housing, poor diet, poverty, and social and/or geographical isolation) but remain very difficult to solve. Early technological and mobile applications for remote management have attempted to address these problems, with somewhat positive results, but require patient self-assessment and do not include objective monitoring of lung status. A small number of wheeze detectors and pulmonary monitors have been approved for marketing by the FDA, but face several technological limitations and are not commercially available in the US. We reasoned that a long-term monitoring solution that can be used in the home by untrained patients, or family members of patients, could detect and monitor severity of airway inflammation in patients, provide insight into reasons for worsening or improved symptoms, provide tailored educational content and direct patients to medical follow before the situation becomes acute, thus reducing trips to emergency departments and readmission rates to hospitals. We find that several challenges exist when considering long term auscultatory monitoring solutions in non-traditional clinical settings: (1) unpredictable ambient noise, (2) the need for medical expertise to interpret lung sounds, (3) subjectivity in the analysis, and (4) difficulty using and placing the stethoscope. In order to overcome many of these challenges, the research team developed a smart stethoscope that was originally intended for use in low-resource countries by community health workers to differentiate between pediatric patients with crackles and wheezes. This smart stethoscope address all the challenges above by including (1) adaptive noise suppression that has been objectively and subjectively proven to be superior in all types of noise environments than traditional or other electronic stethoscopes, (2) on-board analysis algorithms that can detect crackles and wheezes in pediatric patients with an accuracy that matches that of a specialist, and (3) a uniform pickup surface that removes the requirement for exact placement of the device to get an accurate recording. In this project, we will validate that the device can be correctly used by parents of children with asthma through monitoring over a 6-week period following an ED visit through daily recordings. We then plan to confirm that our existing detection algorithms can be used or modified to track changes in the lung sound severity, followed by correlating these algorithm outputs with patient reported outcomes and environmental data. Simultaneously, we will be using patient feedback to iterate on the device design to create a version that minority and underserved patients are comfortable using in their home. This proposal aims to validate a smart auscultation device for home use and develop algorithms that can track changes in, and severity of, wheezes and lung sounds in order to monitor patients over long periods of time, improve the clinical relevance of home monitoring for timely interventions, and decrease hospital admissions. Current state of the art technology available to minority patients suffering from asthma is unable to intelligently monitor patients at home and no long-term monitoring solutions exist for these conditions, resulting in increases in emergency department visits, especially of underserved patient populations. The academic partner has developed a smart stethoscope that offers greatly improved audio fidelity in any type of noise environment, automated on-board analysis and detection algorithms of lung sounds, and increased ease of use. The small business partner is in the process of commercializing the device for clinical use by trained, professional personnel. Together, we are aiming to test whether the device can be reliably used by non-trained personnel for home use, develop algorithms that would provide metrics for monitoring trends and severities of lung sounds, and make this technology easily available to and usable by afflicted populations such that it can improve the long-term outcome for patients and decrease the burden on underserved

"Text2Breathe: Enhance Parent Communication to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases, such as asthma, disproportionately affect African American (AA) children. A key recommendation of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma is partnership between healthcare providers and patients (and their parents, for children). Facilitating parents' open communication with providers regarding healthcare status and concerns can equip them to more effectively partner with their child's primary care provider (PCP). Thus, improving the health communication skills of African American (AA) parents could improve parent's adherence to treatment recommendations including utilization of the primary care for asthma care, and ultimately improve their child's asthma health outcomes. Our team recently completed a randomized controlled trial of an in- person health communication intervention that resulted in more partnerships with PCPs for asthma care and lower urgent care usage, but effects were not sustained past 2 months post-intervention. Mobile technology, such as Short Message Service (SMS, ""text messaging""), is a low-cost means of extending the dosage and scope of this intervention and may be particularly useful among AAs, for whom the use of SMS is widespread. The proposed study involves a SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention (Text2Breathe) designed to equip urban, low-income AA parents with tools/techniques to empower parents to more effectively communicate with their children's PCP. 268 AA parents of children attending an emergency department asthma education clinic will be randomized to usual care or Text2Breathe. The Text2Breathe group will receive ongoing individualized text messages providing instruction about asthma care communication during the year- long intervention period. Outcome data on parental self-efficacy and outcome expectations, adherence to asthma care treatment recommendations (e.g., primary care utilization), and child asthma outcomes will be collected via structured telephone interviews at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-enrollment. This trial can reduce pediatric health disparities by verifying the efficacy of a SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention that can extend to other chronic conditions and have health and policy implications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this text messaging intervention is to equip African American parents to effectively communicate with primary care providers about their child's asthma care needs. Increasing parents' self-efficacy is expected to enhance their adherence to treatment recommendations, specifically utilization of primary care and self- management, and thus improve children's asthma health outcomes. Results of the trial of this intervention can have broad impact on reducing pediatric health disparities because, if efficacious, this SMS-enhanced healthcare communication intervention can be extended to other chronic disease contexts where parent- provider communication is important.",Text2Breathe: Enhance Parent Communication to Reduce Pediatric Asthma Disparities,9676905,R01MD007740,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Poly-omic Study of Asthma Exacerbations in Diverse Populations Asthma exacerbations contribute to considerable disease morbidity and account for nearly half of all asthma- related costs. Moreover, certain population groups, such as African American and Latino individuals, suffer disproportionately from these complications with rates of asthma-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths nearly 3-5 times higher than those of European Americans. There are multiple reasons to believe that individuals who suffer severe exacerbations are genetically predisposed: 1) prior events are among the strongest predictors of future exacerbations, 2) genetic ancestry has been shown to be an independent predictor of exacerbations, and 3) calculations of exacerbation heritability suggest that 30-55% of this trait’s variance may be attributed to additive genetic effects. Nevertheless, we do not currently have genetic biomarkers that can be used clinically to reliably predict susceptibility to asthma exacerbations. Such measures could transform asthma care if they resulted in the early recognition and appropriate treatment of individuals at risk. In this application, we will utilize the enormous amount of whole genome sequence (WGS) data that is being generated on our Asthma Translational Genomics Collaborative (ATGC) as part of the NHLBI’s Trans-Omic Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program. The ATGC comprises 8 cohort studies and 10,819 patients with asthma (7,530 African Americans and 3,081 Latinos). The Genetic Epidemiology of Asthma in Costa Rica (CRA) cohort with its WGS data will also participate (n=1,765). In Aim 1, we will focus on the genomics of asthma exacerbations through the following sub-aims: a) refine our estimates of exacerbation heritability using a WGS data; b) use admixture mapping to identify chromosomal regions likely to harbor risk variants for exacerbations; c) fine-map the aforementioned regions for risk variants using available WGS data; d) replicate these associations in other ATGC cohorts and in the CRA cohort; and e) assess variants for their association with future exacerbations using available prospective clinical data. In Aim 2, we will focus on the transcriptomics of asthma exacerbations. Namely, we will use RNA-sequence data derived from the whole blood transcriptome to identify genes whose expression associated with severe exacerbations (Aim 2a), and we will identify genes whose expression is associated with the genotype of variants identified in Aim 1 (Aim 2b). Aim 3 will focus on the proteomics of asthma exacerbations. Banked serum will be used to assess the proteome of individuals from phenotype extremes (i.e., serum collected from individuals prior to a severe exacerbation vs. serum from individuals with asthma who don’t experience exacerbations). Using mass spectrometry, we will broadly assess serum for proteins differentially expressed between these groups (i.e., an untargeted proteomic approach), and we will use the information gleaned from the genomic, transcriptomic, and untargeted proteomic analyses to assess specific proteins (i.e., a targeted proteomic approach) for expression differences in additional groups of individuals at phenotype extremes. NARRATIVE Asthma attacks (exacerbations) are common and potentially life-threatening, yet simple and reliable ways to identify susceptible individuals do not exist. African Americans and Latinos are two groups at highest risk for these serious events. This application represents the first sizable study to investigate genetic risk factors for asthma attacks in these groups, and we will integrate recent advances in DNA, RNA, and protein analysis to identify these susceptibility markers.",Poly-omic Study of Asthma Exacerbations in Diverse Populations,9661171,R01HL141845,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Costa Rica ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Expenditure ', ' personal finances ', ' Personal Financing ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Genotype ', ' Inducer T-Lymphocytes ', ' Inducer Cells ', ' Helper-Inducer T-Cells ', ' Helper T-Lymphocytes ', ' Helper T-Cells ', ' Helper Cells ', ' Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' IgE ', ' Allergic inflammation ', ' Maps ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Asthma symptom perception feedback intervention for ethnic minority adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under-perception of asthma symptoms in children is a major risk factor for emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and near-fatal/fatal asthma attacks. Puerto Rican and Black children have greater asthma morbidity and mortality rates than all other racial/ethnic groups. Interventions targeting asthma symptom perception and medication adherence may help close this asthma health disparities gap. There are no RCT studies to date designed to improve asthma symptom perception in ethnic minority children. This R01 study builds upon this new investigator PI's prior grants. We demonstrated that children who did not receive peak expiratory flow (PEF) feedback under-perceived asthma symptoms 42% of the time vs. 15% for the PEF feedback group and had lower controller medication adherence (27.5% vs. 48.8%).  The proposed randomized controlled trial consists of two arms: PEF feedback (N = 130) versus control feedback (N = 130). Latino and Black adolescents with asthma ages 10-17 years old and their caregivers will be recruited from clinics in the Bronx, NY. The primary aims are to examine the efficacy of PEF prediction with feedback versus control feedback on 1) under-perception of asthma symptoms 2) controller medication adherence and 3) asthma control and emergency health care use. These aims will be examined across a 1- year follow-up. An exploratory aim examines the hypothesized pathway that the PEF intervention reduces under-perception of symptoms, shifts illness representations toward the professional model and increases adolescents' and parents' asthma management self-efficacy, resulting in greater medication adherence and improved asthma control. The baseline visit for all families consists of standardized asthma education followed by 3 weeks of PEF prediction without feedback using a programmable, electronic spirometer. Participants then will be randomized to intervention group and their spirometer reprogrammed, showing either the actual PEF and daily asthma management messages (PEF feedback group) or a brief, positive message (control feedback group). For the next 6 weeks, all adolescents will predict their PEF, which will be locked in before blowing into the device. Families will return at mid-intervention and post-intervention to receive verbal individualized feedback on symptom perception and problem-solving skills training (PEF feedback group) or supportive counseling (control feedback group). All adolescents will play ""Quest for the Code"" to reinforce the baseline asthma education. At the post-intervention visit, the spirometer will be reprogrammed for all adolescents to provide no feedback for the next 4 weeks. These symptom perception data will be downloaded at 1-month post-intervention. Controller medication adherence will be monitored by electronic devices. Post-intervention sessions will take place at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to collect adherence data and conduct spirometry. Physicians will be blinded to group assignment and rate asthma control using national guidelines. A 12-month retrospective medical record abstraction will compare emergency health care use for asthma between groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An intervention to improve asthma symptom perception has great potential to reduce the immense ethnic disparities that exist in asthma outcomes. Prediction of peak expiratory flow followed by feedback can be applied on a large-scale level due to the accessibility of peak flow meters, brevity of the intervention, and immediate learning effects.

"Integrative Analyses to Uncover Biological Mechanisms Mediating Gene Associations with Asthma Drug Response Among Minority Children PROJECT SUMMARY Identifying genetic variants associated with complex diseases via genome-wide SNP and whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies has outpaced our ability to translate these findings into actionable biologic and clinical insights. We need to use in silico methods that integrate multiple layers of data, including transcriptomic, epigenetic, social, and environmental, to focus experimental validation on the most impactful targets. Asthma-related deaths are 4-fold higher in minority children than white children. Moreover, minority children with asthma have markedly decreased drug response to albuterol, a bronchodilator rescue medication that is the most commonly prescribed asthma medication in the world, and to glucocorticoids, anti-inflammatory medications that decrease symptoms and exacerbations. Our goal is to understand the biological basis of differential drug response that leads to observed racial/ethnic asthma disparities. In this proposal, we use two cloud-based apps we developed to identify functional biologic mechanisms of genes that are associated with racial/ethnic variation in asthma therapies. Specifically, our apps 1) provide gene-centric WGS association findings in the context of integrated multi-tissue omic results, and 2) reprioritize WGS association results using machine-learned tissue-specific networks constructed from gene expression, known protein-protein interactions, and established functional pathways. Our results will increase knowledge about the biological role of genes associated with asthma therapy and facilitate design of experiments to understand their function.

"Physical Activity and Dose of Air Pollution in Pediatric Urban Asthma: Impact of Minute Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY  Exposure to traffic related air pollution (TRAP) is known to trigger childhood asthma symptoms and likely contributes to the disparity in asthma prevalence and morbidity in urban communities. Regular physical activity can improve asthma symptoms. However, increased minute ventilation (ie respiratory rate x tidal volume) during activity may increase deposition of pollutant particles into the airways. Thus, pollution may offset the respiratory benefits of physical activity. One of the challenges of accurately assessing the combined effects of pollution and activity on the airways is that inhaled dose of pollutants could vary by proximity to exposure source and by individual differences in minute ventilation. Therefore, our objective is take an individualized approach to assess change in minute ventilation during childhood activities while also considering variability in home and school exposure to TRAP.  We hypothesize that the positive association between exposure to TRAP and asthma symptoms will be most significant among children that are 1) highly physically active and 2) have larger increases in minute ventilation in response to physical activity. In order to address this hypothesis we will take advantage of 2 existing cohorts of children with differing severity of asthma that are enrolled in the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) studies. For our first aim we will examine the interaction between exposure to TRAP (assessed at home and school using geographic information systems (GIS) technology) and physical activity (assessed by validated questionnaire) on asthma symptoms. We will evaluate these associations in: 1) a cross-sectional cohort of 320 moderate-severe asthmatics, ages 6-17 that live in 10 urban US cities and 2) a 3 year longitudinal cohort of 150 mild-moderate asthmatics, ages 12-16 that live in 4 urban US cities. For our second aim we will recruit a sub-sample of 40 children with mild- moderate asthma that live in New York City. We will combine individual cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with 72-hour accelerometry measurements to determine the magnitude of increase in minute ventilation in response to usual childhood activities. Then we will use these values to determine if larger individual increases in minute ventilation influence the relationship between exposure to TRAP and asthma symptoms. With an enhanced understanding of individual susceptibility to environmentally triggered asthma, we will be better equipped to address and remediate the disproportionate risk of asthma morbidity among urban children. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Exposure to traffic related air pollution is known to trigger childhood asthma symptoms and likely contributes to the disparity in asthma prevalence and morbidity in urban communities. During physical activity, increased respiratory rates and deeper breathing may lead to increased inhaled dose of pollutants. The objective of this research is to determine if increased childhood physical activity and larger increases in breathing patterns in response to physical activity strengthen the association between exposure to pollution and asthma symptoms.",Physical Activity and Dose of Air Pollution in Pediatric Urban Asthma: Impact of Minute Ventilation,9681484,K01HL140216,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Carbon Black ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Exercise ', ' Exercise Test ', ' Exercise stress test ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Seasons ', ' Soot ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' respiratory airway volume ', ' Tidal Volume ', ' United States ', ' Ventilation ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' Weather ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Physical activity ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Exposure to ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' Pollution ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' respiratory ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' skills ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' airway inflammation ', ' airway epithelium inflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Coupled ', ' asthmatic ', ' respiratory health ', ' traffic-related air pollution ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' urban children ', ' minority children ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' recruit ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2019,172816,0.3435122504858623
"A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention for Rural Latino Children K23 Abstract A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention  for Rural Latino Children DESCRIPTION: Rural Latino children with asthma suffer high rates of uncontrolled asthma symptoms, emergency department visits, and repeat hospitalizations. This vulnerable population must negotiate micro and macro level challenges that impact asthma management, including language barriers, primary care access, parental time off from work, insurance coverage, distance from specialty sites, and documentation status. There are few proven interventions that address asthma management embedded within this unique context. Using a bio-ecological approach, we will determine the feasibility of a patient-centered collaborative program between rural Latino children with asthma and their families, school based nursing, and primary care providers, facilitated by the use of a smart phone based mobile application (mobile app) with a Spanish-language interface. We hypothesize that improving communication through a collaborative, patient-centered intervention will improve asthma management, empower the patient and family, decrease outcome disparities, and decrease direct and indirect costs. The specific aims of this study include: 1) Produce and validate a Spanish translation of an existing asthma management app and evaluate its usability with Latino parents of children with asthma; 2) Develop and evaluate a triadic, patient-centered asthma intervention preliminary protocol, facilitated by the bilingual mobile app validated in aim 1; and 3) Investigate the feasibility of the patient-centered asthma intervention from aim 2 using a wait list randomized control trial (RCT) to investigate the effects of the intervention on school days missed and medication adherence. The results of this study will be used to support a full scale randomized control trial R01 grant application in Year 4 of this award. The career development award will provide Dr. Estrada the mentoring and training needed to develop knowledge and skills in rural asthma disparities research, intervention development and program evaluation, and integration of technology- based interventions. At the close of the award, she will be positioned to design, implement, and evaluate research that will significantly impact rural asthma disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is growing evidence that rural asthma rates are similar to urban asthma rates, yet prior research has focused on urban population groups and interventions. Additionally, rural Latino children with asthma have unique challenges and barriers that contribute to health outcomes disparities. The findings from the proposed research will support the development of a targeted and cost-effective intervention that may improve asthma outcomes in this vulnerable population group.",A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention for Rural Latino Children,9753333,K23HL133596,"['Affect ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Award ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Language ', ' Mentors ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' South Carolina ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Transportation ', ' Urban Population ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Population Group ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Facilities and Administrative Costs ', ' Indirect Costs ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' usability ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' control trial ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,K23,2019,145035,0.4020677342516417
"Peer-Administered Asthma Self-Management Intervention in Urban Middle Schools Project Summary/Abstract: Health disparities in pediatric asthma persist, with Latino children demonstrating increased asthma morbidity. Middle school children have greater morbidity than children from any other age group, yet there are no school- based asthma management programs developed for this group. To address these gaps, we have developed and piloted a novel group-based intervention: ASMAS (Asthma Self-MAnagement in Schools) in two geographic areas with a high proportion of urban, Latino children with asthma: Providence, Rhode Island, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. ASMAS is a 4-session, peer-facilitated asthma self-management intervention specific to the school setting for Latino middle school (6th-8th graders) children. It is delivered by trained Latino High School Juniors and Seniors with asthma, adapts guidelines-based self-management to the urban school setting, and is consistent with Latino children's cultural backgrounds. In our pilot RCT, ASMAS improved asthma outcomes and self-management for the targeted groups. Our proposed approach involves a hybrid design including a large-scale randomized, controlled trial investigating the effect of ASMAS, and an evaluation of the implementation process to inform future plans to test ASMAS in additional urban settings. Our first aim is to evaluate the effects of ASMAS on asthma health outcomes (e.g., control, symptom free days, absences, lung function) and asthma self-management (skills, knowledge and self-efficacy, availability of rescue inhaler and action plan at school) in a sample of 432 Latino middle school children with asthma in Providence, RI and San Juan, PR (216 per site; 72 per condition). 6th to 8th grade middle schoolers will be enrolled then randomly assigned to 1) ASMAS, or 2) Asthma Education plus Child Health control condition, or 3) a no treatment control condition (9 groups of each condition per site; 8 children per group). Student and primary caregiver assessments will occur at baseline, end of treatment (directly following the intervention), and at three, 4-month post intervention follow-ups. Our second aim is to conduct a mixed-methods, multi-stakeholder process evaluation using the RE-AIM framework,48-50 with students, caregivers, HS Peers, school administrators and additional community stakeholders invested in supporting students' asthma care. We will begin to develop implementation strategies with key stakeholders to better prepare for future large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of ASMAS and its implementation in additional urban centers. Relative to controls, over 1 year, we expect that ASMAS participants will have improved asthma outcomes and self- management. We also expect treatment effects on asthma outcomes will be mediated through changes in self- management in all children, and moderated by acculturative stress and language proficiency in RI children. The proposed work offers a critical opportunity to evaluate ASMAS for improving asthma outcomes for children at high risk on a larger-scale and to develop avenues for sustainability and future dissemination with state and community stakeholders. Project Narrative Health disparities in pediatric asthma persist, with Latino children demonstrating increased asthma morbidity. Middle school children with asthma have greater morbidity than children from any other age group and spend a majority of their day in school, where they must manage any asthma. We developed and piloted a novel group- based intervention - ASMAS (Asthma Self-MAnagement in Schools) in two geographic areas with a high prevalence of urban and Latino children with asthma: Providence, Rhode Island, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. ASMAS is a 4-session, peer-facilitated asthma self-management intervention specific to the school setting for Latino middle school (6th-8th graders) children. It is delivered by trained High School Juniors and Seniors of Latino descent with asthma. We demonstrated the preliminary effects of ASMAS for improving asthma outcomes and self-management relative to controls. In this proposal, we will evaluate ASMAS through a large- scaled Randomized Control Trial with urban middle school students who have persistent asthma in Providence, RI and San Juan, Puerto Rico and we will identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of ASMAS.

"The Airway Functional Genomics of Bronchodilator Drug Response in Minority Children with Asthma ABSTRACT Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children. Asthma prevalence, mortality, and drug response vary by race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry. In the U.S., asthma prevalence is highest among Puerto Ricans (36.5%), intermediate among African Americans (13.0%) and whites (12.1%), and lowest in Mexicans (7.5%). These disparities extend to asthma mortality, which is four-fold higher in Puerto Ricans and African Americans compared to Mexican Americans. Albuterol is the most commonly prescribed asthma medication in the world and is the mainstay of acute asthma management. Among low income and minority populations in the U.S., albuterol is often the only medication used regardless of asthma severity. Poor drug response contributes to racial/ethnic disparities in asthma morbidity and mortality. Disturbingly, Americans with the highest asthma prevalence and death rate also have the lowest drug response. Chronic albuterol use can decrease acute airway smooth muscle response to albuterol and increase airway inflammation through beta-agonist signaling in the airway epithelium, suggesting that chronic albuterol use may alter acute response through genomic and epigenomic modification of airway cells. Furthermore, acute bronchodilator drug response (BDR) to albuterol is a complex phenotype with an estimated heritability of 28.5%, indicating genetic factors contribute to BDR variability. Genome-wide and whole genome association analyses have revealed population-specific common and rare variants in non-coding regions of the genome associated with the extremes of BDR. The roles of genomic regulatory regions and population-specific variants in BDR have yet to be fully investigated. To this end, we have created an investigative system involving airway-specific cell types, patient-derived cells, and detailed clinical data to generate an encyclopedia of genes, regulatory regions, and pathways involved in BDR to albuterol. We will integrate RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and whole genome sequencing data with detailed clinical data to identify trans-ethnic and population-specific variants contributing to differential expression and chromatin structure patterns in response to albuterol exposure. Furthermore, we will functionally characterize the regulatory regions that underlie acute and chronic albuterol BDR in multi-ethnic children with asthma using CRISPR-Cas9 activation/inhibition assays. These analyses will allow us to determine on a genomic scale the functional consequences of acute and chronic albuterol treatment on airway cells, and provide insight into potential targetable genes, regulatory elements, and pathways for improved asthma therapies in at-risk populations.

"Clinic navigation and home visits to improve guideline-based care and outcomes in low income minority adults with asthma PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Asthma-related deaths, hospitalizations, and ED visits are more numerous among low-income and minority patients, including African Americans and among older adults who tend to suffer from other chronic diseases. Guidelines for asthma management have not met the unique needs of this older group with their socioeconomic burdens and frequent comorbidities. We recently demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and evidence of effectiveness of two separate interventions to improve access to care, patient-provider communication, and asthma outcomes: 1) CI: clinic intervention using a patient advocate to prepare for, attend, and confirm understanding of an office visit, and 2) HV: home visits for care coordination and informing clinicians of home barriers to managing asthma. This project explores whether these interventions can be combined for greater effectiveness and better delivery of guideline-based asthma care and outcomes in low-income minority patients. In addition, we explore whether giving clinicians real-time feedback on the patient’s health and home status structured in the framework of adherence to asthma guidelines is associated with subsequent improvement in asthma outcomes. In a randomized controlled factorial trial, 400 adults with uncontrolled asthma living in low-income urban neighborhoods will be offered 18-months participation: 12 months of clinical intervention and 6 months of evaluation to monitor sustainability of interventions and outcomes. Patients will be randomized to (1) patient advocate alone, (2) patient advocate with home visits, (3) patient advocate with real-time feedback to asthma provider (clinician) at each clinic visit of guidelines-relevant elements of a patient’s current care, and (4) both (2) and (3). The interventions will be delivered by a lay Community Health Navigator (CHN). The study will estimate: Specific Aim 1: improvement over time of within-group (before-after in four groups) asthma outcomes (asthma control, quality of life, ED visits, hospitalizations, prednisone bursts) Specific Aim 2: across group differences in improvement over time in asthma outcomes; Specific Aim 3: the costs associated with each of the interventions, and we will conduct a cost-offset analysis to determine which intervention costs are offset by savings attributable to reductions in ED, hospitalization or other visits for asthma control and other outcomes. Exploratory Aim: changes in behavior from the interventions using interviews of clinicians and patients. Hypothesis and Impact: We hypothesize improved outcomes in asthma patients through enhanced communication of patient and clinician, clinician attention to home environmental exposure, and clinician consideration of the guidelines, at a program cost offset by lower patient health care utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE Few interventions to improve asthma management have targeted low-income minority asthmatic adults, particularly older adults who often also have other health problems. National guidelines focus on children and young adults leaving asthma providers with little evidence-based data to guide clinical decisions for adult patients with multiple comorbidities. This project tests guideline-promoted interventions, delivered by community health navigators in clinical practices and in the home, with feedback to clinicians, to improve asthma control and quality of life for adults with uncontrolled asthma recruited from clinics serving low-income urban neighborhoods.",Clinic navigation and home visits to improve guideline-based care and outcomes in low income minority adults with asthma,9728365,R01HL143364,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Appointment ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hearing ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' physician office visit ', ' Office Visits ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' delta-Cortisone ', ' Prednisonum ', ' Metacortandracin ', ' Deltadehydrocortisone ', ' Deltacortisone ', ' Delta(1)-Cortisone ', ' Dehydrocortisone ', ' 1, 2-Dehydrocortisone ', ' Prednisone ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Steroids ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Voice ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Visit ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' cost ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' household environmental exposure ', ' home environmental exposure ', ' asthmatic ', ' improved outcome ', ' Huntingtin-Associated protein 1 ', ' HAP2 ', ' recruit ', ' program costs ', ' intervention cost ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,829744,0.3592083379020448
"Asthma symptom perception feedback intervention for ethnic minority adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under-perception of asthma symptoms in children is a major risk factor for emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and near-fatal/fatal asthma attacks. Puerto Rican and Black children have greater asthma morbidity and mortality rates than all other racial/ethnic groups. Interventions targeting asthma symptom perception and medication adherence may help close this asthma health disparities gap. There are no RCT studies to date designed to improve asthma symptom perception in ethnic minority children. This R01 study builds upon this new investigator PI's prior grants. We demonstrated that children who did not receive peak expiratory flow (PEF) feedback under-perceived asthma symptoms 42% of the time vs. 15% for the PEF feedback group and had lower controller medication adherence (27.5% vs. 48.8%).  The proposed randomized controlled trial consists of two arms: PEF feedback (N = 130) versus control feedback (N = 130). Latino and Black adolescents with asthma ages 10-17 years old and their caregivers will be recruited from clinics in the Bronx, NY. The primary aims are to examine the efficacy of PEF prediction with feedback versus control feedback on 1) under-perception of asthma symptoms 2) controller medication adherence and 3) asthma control and emergency health care use. These aims will be examined across a 1- year follow-up. An exploratory aim examines the hypothesized pathway that the PEF intervention reduces under-perception of symptoms, shifts illness representations toward the professional model and increases adolescents' and parents' asthma management self-efficacy, resulting in greater medication adherence and improved asthma control. The baseline visit for all families consists of standardized asthma education followed by 3 weeks of PEF prediction without feedback using a programmable, electronic spirometer. Participants then will be randomized to intervention group and their spirometer reprogrammed, showing either the actual PEF and daily asthma management messages (PEF feedback group) or a brief, positive message (control feedback group). For the next 6 weeks, all adolescents will predict their PEF, which will be locked in before blowing into the device. Families will return at mid-intervention and post-intervention to receive verbal individualized feedback on symptom perception and problem-solving skills training (PEF feedback group) or supportive counseling (control feedback group). All adolescents will play ""Quest for the Code"" to reinforce the baseline asthma education. At the post-intervention visit, the spirometer will be reprogrammed for all adolescents to provide no feedback for the next 4 weeks. These symptom perception data will be downloaded at 1-month post-intervention. Controller medication adherence will be monitored by electronic devices. Post-intervention sessions will take place at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to collect adherence data and conduct spirometry. Physicians will be blinded to group assignment and rate asthma control using national guidelines. A 12-month retrospective medical record abstraction will compare emergency health care use for asthma between groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An intervention to improve asthma symptom perception has great potential to reduce the immense ethnic disparities that exist in asthma outcomes. Prediction of peak expiratory flow followed by feedback can be applied on a large-scale level due to the accessibility of peak flow meters, brevity of the intervention, and immediate learning effects. Guessing peak expiratory flow can be appealing for adolescents, and it does not require any cultural adaptation due to the common language of peak expiratory flow.",Asthma symptom perception feedback intervention for ethnic minority adolescents,9614308,R01HL128260,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Bronchodilator Agents ', ' lumen dilator ', ' Bronchodilators ', ' Bronchial-Dilating Agents ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Counseling ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Grant ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Records ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Spirometry ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Forced Vital Capacity ', ' Vital capacity ', ' Work ', ' Bronchial Constriction ', ' Bronchoconstriction ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Self Management ', ' Blinded ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' pulmonary function ', ' Mexican ', ' Fostering ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' meter ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' skills training ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dominican ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Peak Expiratory Flow ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Numerical value ', ' Emergency Care ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' ER care ', ' ED care ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' post intervention ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' individualized feedback ', ' arm ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' minority children ', ' Cuban ', ' recruit ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' asthma attack ', ' ']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2019,695535,0.3036420687833609
"New Approaches for Empowering Studies of Asthma in Populations of African Descent Asthma is a complex disease with striking disparities across racial and ethnic groups, which may be partly attributable to genetic factors. A major goal of the Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA) has been to discover genes conferring risk to asthma in populations of African ancestry. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying genes associated with increased risk of asthma, but there is a substantial gap between associations discovered by GWAS and understanding how these loci control disease. A major portion of the `missing heritability' could be due to variants with smaller effects missed by traditional GWAS thresholds, emphasizing the need for a transition to integrative genetics, where transcriptome, proteome, methylome and metabolome information are brought into a unified framework. Our goal in this continuing renewal is to apply an integrative, multi-omics approach to understand the molecular architecture underlying asthma, building upon the 5-year CAAPA program, where >16,000 asthmatics and non-asthmatics have already been GWAS-genotyped, and GWAS and/or whole genome sequencing (WGS) data are available on more than 100,000 non-CAAPA samples. We propose to test if genetic variants control development of asthma by regulating gene transcription and expression, DNA methylation, metabolic profiles, and proteome variation. The specific aims of this application leverage an international group of investigators with diverse but highly integrated areas of expertise, and include the following: (1) expand and integrate multi-omic resources for asthma research in African Diaspora populations and identify novel genetic determinants for risk of asthma by adding indigenous American and continental African genetic representation in the African Diaspora catalog, building a multi-omic repository through newly generated transcriptome, methylome, proteome, and metabolome data from CAAPA asthmatics and unaffected controls with existing GWAS data from 7 sites in North and South America, the Caribbean and Africa, and performing integrative analyses; (2) broadly disseminate CAAPA results through a web-based resource that empowers the asthma research community for new discoveries; and (3) develop and apply approaches for prioritizing CAAPA results in 3 health systems biobanks enriched for US minority populations (Nashville, New York City, and the Rocky Mountain region) by examining genomics (PheWAS) and multi-omics (PrediXcan) asthma associations identified in CAAPA and non-CAAPA datasets. These studies will advance our understanding of the molecular basis for asthma among populations of African ancestry. The Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA) will expand and build a multi-omics repository in populations with African ancestry, from continental Africa and the Americas, for integrative analysis to empower discovery and functional interpretation of asthma genetic risk. We will also implement web-based technologies to develop an online community resource for asthma researchers, and investigate the impact of asthma loci in three large health systems. Overall, this work will inform the genetic and clinical asthma communities about how to implement genetic discovery using high dimensional data in a clinically useful and technologically innovative manner.",New Approaches for Empowering Studies of Asthma in Populations of African Descent,9618872,R01HL104608,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Americas ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Gabon ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Control Locus ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New York City ', ' Nigeria ', ' North America ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Phenotype ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' South America ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Vertebral column ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' density ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Central American ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' South American ', ' Complex ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Proteome ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Heritability ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' Secure ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' methylome ', ' asthmatic ', ' online community ', ' virtual community ', ' on-line community ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' metabolic profile ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' Indigenous American ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' online resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' online compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' internet resource ', ' population stratification ', ' web-based tool ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' web server ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2019,2272227,0.39603111477976854
"Rhode Island Asthma Integrated Response Program (RI-AIR) Project Summary/Abstract: Greater Providence, Rhode Island is comprised of several urban “core” cities of high poverty and significant pediatric asthma disparity. The RI-Asthma Integrated Response (RI-AIR) Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP) is a comprehensive system of identification, screening and intervention for pediatric asthma. Core components include: a 1) state of the art technology platform (the RI-AIR information data system, or RI-AIR IDS) to integrate data from LifeChart (EHR), REDCap (research data system), and KIDSNet (state-based database of child health information), 2) algorithm for stratification of asthma management services based on level of asthma control/risk, 3) multilevel school-based education (CASE) to family/child/school system for children whose asthma is not well-controlled, 4) intensive home-based intervention (HARP) for children with poorly controlled asthma, and 5) enhanced coordination between caregiver, school nurse, and health care provider to promote integration across sectors of care. The first aim of the proposed work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the RI-AIR ACIP using a randomized, stepped wedge design. During Years 2-4, we will provide our intervention sequentially to sixteen high-risk communities involving approximately 1500 urban, ethnically diverse children (aged 2-12) with asthma and their families. We will evaluate both individual-level (e.g., asthma control) and community-specific outcomes (i.e., rates of ED a multi-level process evaluation of the RI-AIR ACIP during implementation (Years 2-5). We will assess penetration within identified communities and school districts, and evaluate characteristics of families that accept and complete the intervention vs. those who do not. We will determine fidelity of the RI-AIR IDS technology platform in assigning interventions according to asthma control/risk, and treatment fidelity and dose delivered of the HARP and CASE programs. We will use focus groups and provider surveys to determine facilitators of and barriers to visits) for children with asthma. The second aim of this application involves conducting effective implementation. The third aim involves conducting a mixed-methods evaluation of the sustainability of the RI-AIR ACIP, with ongoing input from our community stakeholders during Years 5-6. We define sustainability as continued capacity, continued activities, and continued benefits. We expect over 1 year, participants receiving the RI-AIR ACIP will have improved asthma control and fewer symptom free days relative to baseline. We expect over 1 year, relative to baseline, caregivers will have improved asthma knowledge, self-efficacy, asthma QOL, and indicators of effective disease management. We expect over 1 year, communities receiving the RI-AIR ACIP will have reduced ED visits and hospitalizations relative to their baseline year, and relative to targeted communities that have not yet received RI-AIR. We plan to demonstrate that RI-AIR ACIP is a replicable, evidence-based and cost-saving model that improves asthma outcomes for children at most risk, and can be disseminated to other urban communities to address asthma disparities. Project Narrative Pediatric asthma is a significant public health problem. Striking asthma disparities continue despite available clinical guidelines to manage asthma in home and school settings. There is a crucial need for coordinated systems of asthma care. This proposal will evaluate the effectiveness of the RI-Asthma Integrated Response (RI-AIR) Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP), a comprehensive system of identification, screening and intervention for pediatric asthma, targeted toward high-risk communities in greater Providence, RI. The RI- AIR ACIP is based on home and school interventions for pediatric asthma that have established efficacy, with input from the RI-AIR Collaborative, an established group of key stakeholders involved in the care of children with asthma in the state.

"Using a Spatio-Temporal Framework to Understand Disparities in Pediatric Asthma Emergency Department Visits: a Case Study in South Carolina ABSTRACT: Asthma is the leading chronic pediatric disease in the US, making it a serious and costly public health issue. Children are hospitalized due to asthma for a variety of reasons such as environmental factors and patterns in healthcare. Asthma hospitalizations also exhibit large disparities across many socio-environmental factors. Much can still be learned and there has been little research contrasting disparities across different contextual factors, especially rural/urban. Furthermore, geographical factors are well-known determinants of health disparities and thus a clearer picture of the role that “place” has in the asthma burden could better elucidate risk factors and their synergistic effects, which can lead to improved interventions to address disparities. Spatial epidemiology provides a unique pathway to support this mission as improved assessment of risk factors over space and time can improve public health strategies for addressing disparities in this complex disease. The overarching goal of this research is to improve understanding of neighborhood and environmental risk factors driving disparities in pediatric asthma ED visits. The primary hypothesis for this proposal is that disparities in such risk factors will associate with asthma-related health disparities in children and that these associations will be modified by characteristics of place. To address this, we will employ innovative Bayesian statistical methodologies to analyze highly resolved spatio-temporal data comprised of health outcomes, demographic information, and environmental measures from South Carolina. Our first aim is to identify the spatio-temporal health disparity patterns in pediatric asthma. Our second aim is to quantify the long-term drivers of asthma disparities. Finally, the third aim is to quantify the short term drivers of asthma disparities in an acute health effects framework. The immediate impacts of this work will identify, disaggregate, and rank the factors that contribute to asthma ED visit disparities across many socio- environmental factors, notably urban/rural disparities. This project will refine estimates of environmental exposures and known risk factors of pediatric asthma ED visits, and their interactive effects. The long-term impacts will advance the epidemiologic analysis of disparities in pediatric asthma, a complex and multifactorial disease that has proven challenging to study with existing methods. The research will inform future case- control and cohort research designs of the importance for both collecting and analyzing highly precise spatio- temporal data to better detail health disparities. Furthermore, this research will generate tangible location- specific evidence to direct interventions to reduce disparities in ED visits and their heavy human and financial costs, which could then be used to assess the effectiveness of forthcoming telehealth interventions in improving health trajectories and outcomes among vulnerable children.

"Social adversities and asthma: a new phenotype? ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a common and challenging disease of childhood that disproportionately affects poor minority populations. These populations also experience an excess of social adversities, which are important risk factors for asthma morbidity. However, the response to these adversities is variable: poverty increases the odds of asthma in African Americans, yet decreases it in Mexican Americans. Thus, there is a knowledge gap in our ability to identify individuals vulnerable to social adversities and truly at high-risk for poor asthma outcomes. I am seeking a Mentored NIH K23 Career Development Award to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading, independent researcher in asthma health outcomes. To move towards this goal, my overall objective for this award is to identify disadvantaged minority children at risk for poor asthma outcomes. My central hypothesis is a profile of demographic, social, and environmental characteristics coupled with stress-related biomarkers will predict which individuals are at high risk for poor asthma outcomes, and that this profile will vary by race/ethnicity. This will be testd with the following three aims. Specific Aim 1: Estimate the association between social adversities at individual- and community-levels with asthma susceptibility and morbidity. Social adversities have been identified from administered questionnaire, and geocoded census data obtained from personal address history through a cross-sectional study of 6200 children with and without asthma. Specific Aim 2: Examine if social adversities are associated with biomarkers of stress that may influence asthma susceptibility and morbidity. Stress-related biomarkers will be measured and a link between the biomarkers and asthma outcomes will be examined separately in African American and Latino children. Specific Aim 3: Identify a phenotype susceptible to social adversities and examine how it modifies the course of asthma using a longitudinal approach. A phenotype, or type of asthma, associated with social adversities amongst those with asthma will be identified. Participants with the identified phenotype will be recruited from the original study and followed to understand how this asthma type behaves over time in the presence of social adversities. This proposal will result in identifying an asthma phenotype that will allows us to target individuals at high-risk for poor asthma outcomes related to social adversities. This contribution is significant as utilizing stress related biomarkers may allow us to better risk stratify individuals and, potentially, capture them prior to adverse health outcomes occurring. A multi-disciplinary mentoring committee with diverse expertise: asthma (Drs. Burchard, Cabana), health disparities research (Drs. Burchard, Bibbins-Domingo, Cabana), biostatistics (Dr. Sen), and implementation sciences (Drs. Cattamanchi, Ackerman), will guide the progress of the research agenda. Their mentorship, as well as a focused training and research plan facilitated by a K23 award, will develop my expertise in health disparities research in asthma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American and Latino children experience an excess of poor asthma outcomes and social adversities. We are limited in our ability to identify the individuals who are the most susceptible to social adversities. With this proposal, a phenotype of asthma will be identified that will better discriminate individuals at high risk for poor asthma outcomes. This will allow for the development and application of targeted interventions designed to minimize the effect of social adversities and, thus, improve asthma outcomes in vulnerable populations.",Social adversities and asthma: a new phenotype?,9638563,K23HL125551,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Household ', ' Influentials ', ' Lipids ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Poverty ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Prasterone Sulfate ', ' Dehydroisoandrosterone Sulfate ', ' DHEA Sulfate ', ' DHA Sulfate ', ' Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' GALA ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' pulmonary function ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' experience ', ' income insurance ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' minority children ', ' recruit ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2019,205219,0.4590780589726761
"The effect of a housing mobility program on environmental exposures and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Asthma morbidity continues to be a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods despite the availability of highly effective controller medications. Major contributors to the disproportionatey high asthma morbidity in this population are exposure to pest allergens (mouse and cockroach) and indoor pollutants (particulate matter (PM) due to second hand smoke and neighborhood PM). Efforts to reduce these exposures using home environmental interventions (EIs) have had only modest effects on measures of asthma symptoms and they have had little effect on reducing acute care visits or on improving lung function which are critical markers of high health care costs and poor long-term outcomes. The limited efficacy of EIs in this high-risk population is likely due to only modest reductions of indoor allergens and pollutants achieved by EIs. Housing mobility programs offer an alternative intervention with the strong potential to achieve large reductions in allergens and pollutants and thereby improve asthma health across a broad range of indicators including acute visits and lung function. We propose to conduct such a study in the context of the Baltimore Mobility Program (BMP), the nation's largest mobility program. We have partnered with BMP, and together have found that among families in BMP who have moved away from Baltimore City, pest allergen and PM exposures are much lower than in the homes of similar children living in Baltimore City. Our preliminary data and findings to date provide strong support for the hypothesis that moving to good quality housing in a better neighborhood through a housing mobility program will result in improvements in asthma outcomes, and that these improvements will be mediated by reductions in exposure to pest allergens and indoor PM. Through prospectively recruiting and following families as they enter into the Baltimore Mobility Program, we seek to address the following specific aims: (1) To determine the effect of moving from a low-income urban neighborhood to good quality housing in a better neighborhood on asthma-related outcomes by comparing outcomes among 5-17 year old children with persistent asthma who move to similar children who do not move, and (2) To estimate the causal effects of reducing indoor pest allergens and PM by moving to better housing on asthma outcomes using principal stratification, a statistical method for causal inference in environmental studies. The proposed study has the potential to have significant implications for the role of housing policy as a tool to address asthma disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma morbidity continues to be a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods, and the major contributors are thought to be due to exposures to pest allergens and indoor pollution. Reduction of home allergens and pollution is very difficult in homes in low-income urban neighborhoods where outdoor pollution is high and pest infestation is endemic, and housing mobility programs, which offer counseling and financial assistance for families to move to better neighborhoods, have strong potential to achieve large reductions in allergens and pollutants and thereby reduce asthma morbidity. Through prospectively recruiting and following families as they enter into the Baltimore Housing Mobility Program, we will determine the effect of moving from a low-income urban neighborhood to good quality housing in a better neighborhood on asthma-related outcomes among children with asthma.",The effect of a housing mobility program on environmental exposures and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children,9656993,R01ES026170,"['Affect ', ' Allergens ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Baltimore ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Cockroaches ', ' Dictyoptera ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' financial assistance ', ' Financial Support ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' IgE ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Exhalation ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhaling ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' pollutant ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cockroach allergen ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Modification ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 years of age ', ' environmental intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' high efficiency particulate air filter ', ' HEPA cleaner ', ' HEPA Filtration ', ' HEPA Filter ', ' Indoor pollutant ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' indoor allergen ', ' mouse allergen ', ' minority children ', ' Section 8 ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIEHS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,654209,0.1840893626729233
"Translating an Efficacious Illness Management Intervention for African American Youth with Poorly Controlled Asthma to Real World Settings There is a critical need to develop interventions to reduce barriers to optimal asthma management and reduce the significant risk for asthma-related morbidity experienced by minority children, especially African- American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma. There are few clinical trials focusing on African-American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma, and intervention studies targeting African-American adolescents with asthma in general or African-American children with poorly controlled asthma in particular are characterized by methodological limitations and/or limited effects on objective health outcomes. Multisystemic Therapy-Health Care (MST-HC) is an intensive, multi-component, home-based psychotherapy that targets the multiple causes of poor adolescent asthma management across individual, family and community systems. In a randomized clinical trial, we showed that MST-HC was significantly more effective than home-based family support in improving adherence to controller medications and improving lung functioning among African- American adolescents with moderate to severe, poorly controlled asthma up to six months after the completion of the intervention. In addition, MST-HC reduced asthma-related hospitalizations and associated ED visits. The primary purpose of the proposed study is to adapt MST-HC for use in real world, public healthcare settings and test it in a T3 translational trial. The new intervention, Reach for Control (RFC), will be housed in a pediatric emergency department (ED) at Children's Hospital of Michigan (CHM)and will be adapted for delivery by community health workers (CHWs). The design is an effectiveness-implementation “Hybrid 1” design where the primary aims are to determine the effectiveness of an evidence-based intervention in a real-world setting, and the secondary aims are to gather information about the context for implementation and barriers/ facilitators to implementation. For our effectiveness aim, we will conduct a randomized effectiveness trial with 170 high risk adolescents with poorly controlled asthma seen in the ED for an asthma exacerbation. RFC will be delivered by Wayne Children's Healthcare Access Program, a community agency providing health care services to underserved children in the Detroit area and will be compared to the agency's standard care intervention for youth with poorly controlled asthma. For our implementation aims, we will evaluate the effectiveness of identification, screening and referral to RFC by ED clinical staff via a clinical pathway. We will study barriers and facilitators to the implementation of RFC (both its integration within the ED and delivery by CHWs) using a mixed methods approach. We will also develop and evaluate an efficient and effective method of measuring CHW fidelity to RFC and conduct a cost analysis that will inform decisions such as treatment dose and CHW caseload in future real-world implementations. If successful, the study has the potential to improve quality of life for a vulnerable population while reducing healthcare costs.   There is a critical need to develop and disseminate successful illness management interventions for African American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma. The purpose of the proposed study is to adapt and test an evidence-based intervention for these adolescents for use in real world, pediatric emergency departments (EDs) and evaluate factors affecting intervention implementation.

"The Asthma Action at Erie Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma Action at Erie Trial Asthma prevalence and morbidity has been increasing among children over the last three decades despite significant advances in environmental control and asthma care. The annual costs for children with asthma range between $2.0 and $3.2 billion. Asthma morbidity and its associated costs are not borne equally; they are highest for urban, low income, African American and Puerto Rican children. Community health workers (CHWs) have been growing in popularity as a potential intervention to combat these asthma disparities. CHWs are frontline public health workers who serve as liaisons between health and social services and communities to facilitate access to services and improve the quality and cultural competence of service delivery. The evidence on CHW asthma intervention efficacy has been growing but several critical gaps still exist. The Asthma Action at Erie Trial will test the ability of a CHW intervention with three important modifications to achiev asthma control in high-risk children: 1) CHWs will be integrated into both the clinical and the home setting, 2) A system for directly addressing mental health and psychosocial barriers will be provided, and 3) Participants will be provided only materials and equipment for trigger remediation that are supported by the current medical reimbursement system. A two-arm behavioral randomized controlled trial (N=220) will be conducted in partnership with a federally- qualified health center (FQHC) serving a low income, minority population that is at high-risk for significant asthma morbidity. The intervention arm will receive an integrated CHW home intervention for pediatric asthma education. The comparison arm will received clinic-based certified asthma educator (AE-C) services. Primary Aim 1 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention, relative to clinic-based AE-C education over 12-months, as demonstrated by asthma control. We hypothesize that the CHW arm will have at least 30% fewer days with activity limitation than the AE-C arm at 12-months. Specific Aim 2 is to assess maintenance of intervention efficacy, as demonstrated by asthma control at 18 and 24 months after randomization. Specific Aim 3 is to determine the cost-effectiveness at 12-months of CHW and AE-C intervention delivery, and additional costs or savings related to asthma exacerbations at 12- and 24-months. Specific Aim 4 is to assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention relative to clinic- based AE-C education, as demonstrated by asthma control, among those experiencing depression, stress, and/or a post-traumatic stress disorder. This trial compares the current best practice in asthma self- management education (AE-C services) to an integrated CHW home intervention in which the real-life challenges of patients and the health care system are taken fully into account. This trial will provide clarity a to the expected effect size, cost savings, and resources needed to integrate asthma CHWs into clinical practice. . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma Action at Erie Trial Support for community health worker (CHW) interventions is increasing rapidly despite an incomplete evidence base.

"Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management - Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP) In the US, children from minority ethnic and racial backgrounds suffer disproportionately from asthma. Despite well established guidelines, under-treatment for asthma is common, especially for poor and minority populations. Our prior work has demonstrated that school-based directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medications can improve outcomes for poor, urban children with persistent asthma. We have also found that school-based telemedicine can effectively facilitate assessments by primary care providers (PCPs) for preventive medication prescriptions for DOT and for follow-up care. However, to our concern we have found that children do not benefit equally from our programs. Specifically, among the subgroup of children with moderate to severe persistent or difficult to control asthma at baseline, the majority did not achieve control despite these school-based interventions. In fact, despite telemedicine follow-up assessments with PCP prompting for guideline-based step-ups in treatments, many of these children remained under-treated. We realize that our existing programs may be insufficient for these children, since they do not include specialist consultation for optimization of medication management or for identification and treatment of co-morbid conditions and triggers. Importantly, specialist care is substantially underutilized by poor and minority children who bear the greatest morbidity burden from asthma, leading to inconsistent delivery of guideline-based treatments and continued disparities. In response to PAR-15-279, we propose an innovative school-based program for urban children with moderate to severe persistent or difficult to control asthma. The Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management-Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP) program enhances our school-based, primary care directed asthma program with specialist-supported care to ensure optimal guideline-based treatment. We propose a randomized trial of TEAM-UP versus an enhanced care comparison group. We will prompt PCPs of all enrolled children (n=360, 4-12 years) to initiate school-based DOT of preventive asthma medication and will recommend referral to an asthma specialist. For children in TEAM-UP, the specialist visits will be facilitated via telemedicine at school. The initial telemedicine specialist visit will be scheduled after 4 weeks of DOT, in order to allow for accurate guideline-based assessments of medication and care needs once adherence with a daily controller medication is established. There will also be 2 telemedicine follow-up specialist visits to assess the child's response to treatment and make needed adjustments. We will capitalize on the existing community infrastructure by implementing both telemedicine and DOT in schools, and maintaining collaboration with the PCP. We will assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of TEAM-UP in reducing morbidity and improving guideline-based care (primary outcome: symptom-free days at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) versus enhanced care.

NARRATIVE - RELEVANCE This project is expected to have a profound impact on public health because it proposes an innovative intervention, built from our previously successful school-based programs, to address gaps in the care of children at highest risk for poor asthma outcomes. We aim to ensure optimal guideline-based asthma management using school-based telemedicine to link high risk children with specialist directed asthma care in partnership with primary care providers.

"Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management - Uniting Providers for Teens (TEAM-UP for Teens) Low-income, minority teenagers have disproportionately high rates of asthma morbidity, including excess risk of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and death from asthma. Despite well established guidelines, under-treatment for asthma is common, particularly for poor urban teens. Our prior work has demonstrated that school-based directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medications can improve outcomes for young, urban children with persistent asthma. We have also found that school-based telemedicine can effectively facilitate assessments by primary care providers (PCPs) for preventive medication prescriptions for DOT and for follow-up care. We recently conducted a study for teens with persistent asthma which included a trial of DOT of preventive medications at school paired with motivational interviewing (MI) counseling to promote independent adherence. While this program successfully improved medication adherence, it had a limited effect on asthma symptoms, and in particular many of the teens with moderate to severe persistent asthma at baseline continued to experience poor control despite the intervention. This was at least in part because for many of these teens, the medications initially prescribed for DOT were not optimally adjusted by PCPs and their asthma was undertreated. We realize that this program may be insufficient for these teens (>½ of the overall sample), since access to recommended specialist consultation for medication step-up or management of co-morbidities was not included. Further, while education and self-management support are critical for this age group, the MI counseling in this program required resources for several in-person visits. We now aim to test a novel, developmentally appropriate and scalable model of care to ensure optimal guideline- based treatment for urban teens with difficult to control asthma. The Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management-Uniting Providers for Teens (TEAM-UP Teens) program includes 3 core components: 1) An optimized asthma management plan developed at the start of the school year via a real-time, synchronous school-based telemedicine visit that directly connects the teen to an asthma specialist, 2) School-based DOT to implement the medication plan and allow for teens to experience the benefits of consistent therapy, 3) Follow-up telehealth visits with a nurse asthma educator to facilitate ongoing care and provide developmentally appropriate self-management support. In response to PA-18-722; Improving Patient Adherence to Treatment and Prevention Regimens, we propose a full-scale randomized trial of TEAM-UP for Teens vs an enhanced care (EC) control group (n=360, 12-16yrs). We will capitalize on the existing community infrastructure by implementing both telemedicine visits and DOT in schools. We will assess the effectiveness of TEAM-UP for Teens in reducing morbidity and improving guideline-based care (primary outcome: symptom-free days at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) versus EC. At the study's completion, the program will be better defined as a sustainable means to improve care and reduce morbidity for high risk teens with moderate to severe persistent asthma. NARRATIVE-RELEVANCE Urban adolescents with asthma suffer from substantial morbidity and suboptimal preventive care. This project is expected to have a profound impact on public health because it proposes an innovative and sustainable intervention that uses specialist directed telemedicine and virtual care management, along with school-based DOT, to optimize guideline-based care and improve outcomes for high risk teens with asthma.

"Poly-omic Study of Asthma Exacerbations in Diverse Populations Asthma exacerbations contribute to considerable disease morbidity and account for nearly half of all asthma- related costs. Moreover, certain population groups, such as African American and Latino individuals, suffer disproportionately from these complications with rates of asthma-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths nearly 3-5 times higher than those of European Americans. There are multiple reasons to believe that individuals who suffer severe exacerbations are genetically predisposed: 1) prior events are among the strongest predictors of future exacerbations, 2) genetic ancestry has been shown to be an independent predictor of exacerbations, and 3) calculations of exacerbation heritability suggest that 30-55% of this trait’s variance may be attributed to additive genetic effects. Nevertheless, we do not currently have genetic biomarkers that can be used clinically to reliably predict susceptibility to asthma exacerbations. Such measures could transform asthma care if they resulted in the early recognition and appropriate treatment of individuals at risk. In this application, we will utilize the enormous amount of whole genome sequence (WGS) data that is being generated on our Asthma Translational Genomics Collaborative (ATGC) as part of the NHLBI’s Trans-Omic Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program. The ATGC comprises 8 cohort studies and 10,819 patients with asthma (7,530 African Americans and 3,081 Latinos). The Genetic Epidemiology of Asthma in Costa Rica (CRA) cohort with its WGS data will also participate (n=1,765). In Aim 1, we will focus on the genomics of asthma exacerbations through the following sub-aims: a) refine our estimates of exacerbation heritability using a WGS data; b) use admixture mapping to identify chromosomal regions likely to harbor risk variants for exacerbations; c) fine-map the aforementioned regions for risk variants using available WGS data; d) replicate these associations in other ATGC cohorts and in the CRA cohort; and e) assess variants for their association with future exacerbations using available prospective clinical data. In Aim 2, we will focus on the transcriptomics of asthma exacerbations. Namely, we will use RNA-sequence data derived from the whole blood transcriptome to identify genes whose expression associated with severe exacerbations (Aim 2a), and we will identify genes whose expression is associated with the genotype of variants identified in Aim 1 (Aim 2b). Aim 3 will focus on the proteomics of asthma exacerbations. Banked serum will be used to assess the proteome of individuals from phenotype extremes (i.e., serum collected from individuals prior to a severe exacerbation vs. serum from individuals with asthma who don’t experience exacerbations). Using mass spectrometry, we will broadly assess serum for proteins differentially expressed between these groups (i.e., an untargeted proteomic approach), and we will use the information gleaned from the genomic, transcriptomic, and untargeted proteomic analyses to assess specific proteins (i.e., a targeted proteomic approach) for expression differences in additional groups of individuals at phenotype extremes. NARRATIVE Asthma attacks (exacerbations) are common and potentially life-threatening, yet simple and reliable ways to identify susceptible individuals do not exist. African Americans and Latinos are two groups at highest risk for these serious events. This application represents the first sizable study to investigate genetic risk factors for asthma attacks in these groups, and we will integrate recent advances in DNA, RNA, and protein analysis to identify these susceptibility markers.",Poly-omic Study of Asthma Exacerbations in Diverse Populations,9850125,R01HL141845,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Costa Rica ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Expenditure ', ' Personal Financing ', ' personal finances ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genotype ', ' Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte ', ' Helper Cells ', ' Helper T-Cells ', ' Helper T-Lymphocytes ', ' Helper-Inducer T-Cells ', ' Inducer Cells ', ' Inducer T-Lymphocytes ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' IgE ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' Allergic inflammation ', ' Maps ', ' Morbidity -

"Pediatric Asthma Disparities: The Role of Sleep and Immune Balance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K24 application proposes a mentorship program in patient-oriented research in multi-level contributors to pediatric asthma health disparities, wih a focus on sleep and immune balance. The K24 Candidate is an Associate Professor (Research) in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior of the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, with a history of funding in behavioral interventions and longitudinal research aimed at improving asthma outcomes in urban children and addressing health disparities in pediatric asthma. Training Plan: The candidate will obtain additional training in asthma clinical immunology and sleep physiology, including state-of the art methods to assess immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep, and in-lab methods to assess sleep phenomenology through experimental approaches. Research Plan: The research proposed involves an innovative investigation of the effects of experimental sleep disruption on immune balance (Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio-Th1/Th2R; plasma IL-6 -pIL-6), and associated changes in asthma- related lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) and daytime performance in urban children with persistent asthma (8-10 years old). Forty children and their primary caregiver will each participate in a within-subjects protocol, with two experimental sleep conditions: baseline sleep (1 overnight, in-lab polysomnographic (PSG) sleep study), followed by sleep fragmentation (1 overnight, in-lab PSG). Prior to each condition, children will follow a 6-day sleep stabilization schedule at home. We will monitor sleep and lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) daily to confirm eligibility and adherence to sleep criteria, and assess asthma status. We include assessments of immune biomarkers and daytime performance following each condition. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentoring Plan: The proposed mentoring plan offers opportunities for mentorship of postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty with interests in POR. Mentees will be involved in ongoing longitudinal and intervention studies on pediatric asthma disparities, including the proposed research, which will focus on biological-based processes that contribute to asthma and sleep in urban children. A strong emphasis is placed on the recruitment and selection of minority mentees. This overall plan capitalizes on the rich resources and training opportunities available to postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty at Brown Medical School, including several T32 fellowship programs, numerous junior faculty with K awards and small grants, a commitment to diversity in training, seminars in research design, ethics, and statistics, and an established infrastructure for evaluation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pediatric health disparities in the area of asthma and sleep continue to exist. Urban poverty and poorly controlled asthma can both adversely impact sleep quality by disrupting the continuity of nighttime sleep. Increased asthma symptoms and sleep disruption have each been linked with changes in immune balance. The immune imbalance associated with asthma in children may be greater in the context of sleep disruption, and this may adversely impact daytime functioning and increase inflammation that can bring on asthma symptoms. This K24 application will provide mentorship in patient-oriented research to post-doctoral fellows, residents, and junior faculty interested in multi-level contributing factors to disparities in pediatric asthma. The research proposed involves the implementation of an experimental approach to examine the effects of sleep disruption on immune imbalance, asthma-related lung function, and daytime performance in urban children (ages 8-10) with persistent, allergic asthma. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentorship goals involve providing training to post-doctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty, particularly those from minority backgrounds, in patient-oriented research focused on pediatric health disparities. The proposed career training activities to enhance knowledge and assessment of asthma clinical immunology and sleep physiology, will allow for more broadened opportunities for mentorship to trainees. In addition to the proposed research, mentees will be provided with multiple, ongoing opportunities for training in patient-oriented research on pediatric asthma health disparities.",Pediatric Asthma

"Translating an Efficacious Illness Management Intervention for African American Youth with Poorly Controlled Asthma to Real World Settings There is a critical need to develop interventions to reduce barriers to optimal asthma management and reduce the significant risk for asthma-related morbidity experienced by minority children, especially African- American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma. There are few clinical trials focusing on African-American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma, and intervention studies targeting African-American adolescents with asthma in general or African-American children with poorly controlled asthma in particular are characterized by methodological limitations and/or limited effects on objective health outcomes. Multisystemic Therapy-Health Care (MST-HC) is an intensive, multi-component, home-based psychotherapy that targets the multiple causes of poor adolescent asthma management across individual, family and community systems. In a randomized clinical trial, we showed that MST-HC was significantly more effective than home-based family support in improving adherence to controller medications and improving lung functioning among African- American adolescents with moderate to severe, poorly controlled asthma up to six months after the completion of the intervention. In addition, MST-HC reduced asthma-related hospitalizations and associated ED visits. The primary purpose of the proposed study is to adapt MST-HC for use in real world, public healthcare settings and test it in a T3 translational trial. The new intervention, Reach for Control (RFC), will be housed in a pediatric emergency department (ED) at Children's Hospital of Michigan (CHM)and will be adapted for delivery by community health workers (CHWs). The design is an effectiveness-implementation “Hybrid 1” design where the primary aims are to determine the effectiveness of an evidence-based intervention in a real-world setting, and the secondary aims are to gather information about the context for implementation and barriers/ facilitators to implementation. For our effectiveness aim, we will conduct a randomized effectiveness trial with 170 high risk adolescents with poorly controlled asthma seen in the ED for an asthma exacerbation. RFC will be delivered by Wayne Children's Healthcare Access Program, a community agency providing health care services to underserved children in the Detroit area and will be compared to the agency's standard care intervention for youth with poorly controlled asthma. For our implementation aims, we will evaluate the effectiveness of identification, screening and referral to RFC by ED clinical staff via a clinical pathway. We will study barriers and facilitators to the implementation of RFC (both its integration within the ED and delivery by CHWs) using a mixed methods approach. We will also develop and evaluate an efficient and effective method of measuring CHW fidelity to RFC and conduct a cost analysis that will inform decisions such as treatment dose and CHW caseload in future real-world implementations. If successful, the study has the potential to improve quality of life for a vulnerable population while reducing healthcare costs.   There is a critical need to develop and disseminate successful illness management interventions for African American adolescents with poorly controlled asthma.

"Chicago Asthma School-Directed Child-Centered Assessment and Dissemination of Evidence (CASCADE) Program PROJECT ABSTRACT Significant health disparities persist in childhood asthma prevalence and morbidity despite existing evidence- based asthma guidelines that have been shown to improve outcomes. Schools are an integral partner in asthma management. Prior literature has outlined various targeted school-based interventions with some positive outcomes; however, these programs focus on individual components of the guidelines and take place transiently without integration into school processes for sustainability. To more comprehensively impact asthma care, schools have enacted policies to support guideline-based practices; however, implementation falls short and thus these policies have not led to effective, systemic practices. Therefore, I aim to bridge the gap in the implementation of asthma guidelines and policies by developing and evaluating a pragmatic, multi- component school-directed, child-centered asthma program that builds upon existing targeted interventions and is integrated in the school to foster sustainability. This innovative project contributes beyond existing school-based programs by simultaneously and pragmatically implementing multiple components of the asthma guidelines through school-wide systems and streamlined processes led by lay health workers. I have built a strong foundation for this novel and important research by developing a strong partnership with a multi-campus urban school network that serves a minority, low-income population and conducting preliminary research that highlights the important gaps in asthma care. In this proposal, I will develop and evaluate an innovative multi- component program in two elementary schools (Aim 1). First, I will pilot guideline-based intervention components and determine feasibility and efficacy (1A). I will then utilize this data and existing literature about school-based interventions to implement and evaluate a multi-component program (1B). Key outcomes will focus on the patient (asthma control), organization (school attendance), and cost. In addition, I will determine diverse stakeholder perspectives about the program components and the overall program as part of a pre- implementation assessment to prepare for broader implementation and dissemination in a large, diverse urban public school district (Aim 2).The results will be used for R01 studies that expand the application of the school- directed, child-centered model to the large, diverse public school district in Chicago, compare its effectiveness to other school-based asthma interventions, and conduct a full societal cost-effectiveness analysis. During this career development award, I will work closely with my mentors and an expert advisory committee of leaders in health disparities, asthma, community and school-based programs, implementation science, and statistical and cost analyses. This award will allow me to obtain additional necessary training in advanced research methods and data analysis, as well as implementation and dissemination research. The proposed research and training will position me to become an independent investigator and national leader who integrates community- engaged research with implementation science to advance patient outcomes and reduce asthma disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Research has shown that adherence to evidence-based asthma guidelines leads to improved outcomes, yet critical gaps remain in the implementation of these guidelines, particularly among minority and low-income youth. Schools represent a crucial point of intervention, as demonstrated by school-based asthma programs that have addressed individual components of the guidelines with promising results. This proposal aims to develop, implement, and evaluate a pragmatic, multi-component asthma program that builds upon existing targeted interventions to fully implement the asthma guidelines and integrate them in school practices to foster sustainability.",Chicago Asthma School-Directed Child-Centered Assessment and Dissemination of Evidence (CASCADE) Program,9892223,K23HL143128,"['Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' evidence base ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' project dissemination ', ' program dissemination ', ' school district ', ' improved outcome ', ' urban school ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' societal costs ', ' Absenteeism ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Chicago ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' assess cost ', ' cost assessment ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Literature ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Suggestion ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Administrator ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K23,2020,184032,0.41476061818353943
"The Airway Functional Genomics of Bronchodilator Drug Response in Minority Children with Asthma ABSTRACT Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children. Asthma prevalence, mortality, and drug response vary by race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry. In the U.S., asthma prevalence is highest among Puerto Ricans (36.5%), intermediate among African Americans (13.0%) and whites (12.1%), and lowest in Mexicans (7.5%). These disparities extend to asthma mortality, which is four-fold higher in Puerto Ricans and African Americans compared to Mexican Americans. Albuterol is the most commonly prescribed asthma medication in the world and is the mainstay of acute asthma management. Among low income and minority populations in the U.S., albuterol is often the only medication used regardless of asthma severity. Poor drug response contributes to racial/ethnic disparities in asthma morbidity and mortality. Disturbingly, Americans with the highest asthma prevalence and death rate also have the lowest drug response. Chronic albuterol use can decrease acute airway smooth muscle response to albuterol and increase airway inflammation through beta-agonist signaling in the airway epithelium, suggesting that chronic albuterol use may alter acute response through genomic and epigenomic modification of airway cells. Furthermore, acute bronchodilator drug response (BDR) to albuterol is a complex phenotype with an estimated heritability of 28.5%, indicating genetic factors contribute to BDR variability. Genome-wide and whole genome association analyses have revealed population-specific common and rare variants in non-coding regions of the genome associated with the extremes of BDR. The roles of genomic regulatory regions and population-specific variants in BDR have yet to be fully investigated. To this end, we have created an investigative system involving airway-specific cell types, patient-derived cells, and detailed clinical data to generate an encyclopedia of genes, regulatory regions, and pathways involved in BDR to albuterol. We will integrate RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and whole genome sequencing data with detailed clinical data to identify trans-ethnic and population-specific variants contributing to differential expression and chromatin structure patterns in response to albuterol exposure. Furthermore, we will functionally characterize the regulatory regions that underlie acute and chronic albuterol BDR in multi-ethnic children with asthma using CRISPR-Cas9 activation/inhibition assays. These analyses will allow us to determine on a genomic scale the functional consequences of acute and chronic albuterol treatment on airway cells, and provide insight into potential targetable genes, regulatory elements, and pathways for improved asthma therapies in at-risk populations. NARRATIVE Our goal is to understand the genetic and environmental basis of racial/ethnic differences in asthma and drug response. Results from this proposal will inform public health policy and clinical practice and aid in the understanding of the asthma racial paradox, which may lead to more targeted therapies.",The Airway Functional Genomics of Bronchodilator Drug Response in Minority Children with Asthma,9889982,R01HL117004,"['Air ', ' Albuterol ', ' Proventil ', ' Salbutamol ', ' Ventolin ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bronchodilator Agents ', ' Bronchial-Dilating Agents ', ' Bronchodilators ', ' lumen dilator ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Encyclopedias ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Morbidity -

"Social adversities and asthma: a new phenotype? ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a common and challenging disease of childhood that disproportionately affects poor minority populations. These populations also experience an excess of social adversities, which are important risk factors for asthma morbidity. However, the response to these adversities is variable: poverty increases the odds of asthma in African Americans, yet decreases it in Mexican Americans. Thus, there is a knowledge gap in our ability to identify individuals vulnerable to social adversities and truly at high-risk for poor asthma outcomes. I am seeking a Mentored NIH K23 Career Development Award to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading, independent researcher in asthma health outcomes. To move towards this goal, my overall objective for this award is to identify disadvantaged minority children at risk for poor asthma outcomes. My central hypothesis is a profile of demographic, social, and environmental characteristics coupled with stress-related biomarkers will predict which individuals are at high risk for poor asthma outcomes, and that this profile will vary by race/ethnicity. This will be testd with the following three aims. Specific Aim 1: Estimate the association between social adversities at individual- and community-levels with asthma susceptibility and morbidity. Social adversities have been identified from administered questionnaire, and geocoded census data obtained from personal address history through a cross-sectional study of 6200 children with and without asthma. Specific Aim 2: Examine if social adversities are associated with biomarkers of stress that may influence asthma susceptibility and morbidity. Stress-related biomarkers will be measured and a link between the biomarkers and asthma outcomes will be examined separately in African American and Latino children. Specific Aim 3: Identify a phenotype susceptible to social adversities and examine how it modifies the course of asthma using a longitudinal approach. A phenotype, or type of asthma, associated with social adversities amongst those with asthma will be identified. Participants with the identified phenotype will be recruited from the original study and followed to understand how this asthma type behaves over time in the presence of social adversities. This proposal will result in identifying an asthma phenotype that will allows us to target individuals at high-risk for poor asthma outcomes related to social adversities. This contribution is significant as utilizing stress related biomarkers may allow us to better risk stratify individuals and, potentially, capture them prior to adverse health outcomes occurring. A multi-disciplinary mentoring committee with diverse expertise: asthma (Drs. Burchard, Cabana), health disparities research (Drs. Burchard, Bibbins-Domingo, Cabana), biostatistics (Dr. Sen), and implementation sciences (Drs. Cattamanchi, Ackerman), will guide the progress of the research agenda. Their mentorship, as well as a focused training and research plan facilitated by a K23 award, will develop my expertise in health disparities research in asthma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American and Latino children experience an excess of poor asthma outcomes and social adversities. We are limited in our ability to identify the individuals who are the most susceptible to social adversities. With this proposal, a phenotype of asthma will be identified that will better discriminate individuals at high risk for poor asthma outcomes. This will allow for the development and application of targeted interventions designed to minimize the effect of social adversities and, thus, improve asthma outcomes in vulnerable populations.",Social adversities and asthma: a new phenotype?,9878908,K23HL125551,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticoids ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' Influentials ', ' Lipids ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Poverty ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate ', ' DHA Sulfate ', ' DHEA Sulfate ', ' Dehydroisoandrosterone Sulfate ', ' Prasterone Sulfate ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' GALA ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' pulmonary function ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' experience ', ' income insurance ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' social ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' minority children ', ' recruit ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' clinical exam ', ' clinical examination ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,205219,0.4590780589726761
"The effect of a housing mobility program on environmental exposures and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Asthma morbidity continues to be a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods despite the availability of highly effective controller medications. Major contributors to the disproportionatey high asthma morbidity in this population are exposure to pest allergens (mouse and cockroach) and indoor pollutants (particulate matter (PM) due to second hand smoke and neighborhood PM). Efforts to reduce these exposures using home environmental interventions (EIs) have had only modest effects on measures of asthma symptoms and they have had little effect on reducing acute care visits or on improving lung function which are critical markers of high health care costs and poor long-term outcomes. The limited efficacy of EIs in this high-risk population is likely due to only modest reductions of indoor allergens and pollutants achieved by EIs. Housing mobility programs offer an alternative intervention with the strong potential to achieve large reductions in allergens and pollutants and thereby improve asthma health across a broad range of indicators including acute visits and lung function. We propose to conduct such a study in the context of the Baltimore Mobility Program (BMP), the nation's largest mobility program. We have partnered with BMP, and together have found that among families in BMP who have moved away from Baltimore City, pest allergen and PM exposures are much lower than in the homes of similar children living in Baltimore City. Our preliminary data and findings to date provide strong support for the hypothesis that moving to good quality housing in a better neighborhood through a housing mobility program will result in improvements in asthma outcomes, and that these improvements will be mediated by reductions in exposure to pest allergens and indoor PM. Through prospectively recruiting and following families as they enter into the Baltimore Mobility Program, we seek to address the following specific aims: (1) To determine the effect of moving from a low-income urban neighborhood to good quality housing in a better neighborhood on asthma-related outcomes by comparing outcomes among 5-17 year old children with persistent asthma who move to similar children who do not move, and (2) To estimate the causal effects of reducing indoor pest allergens and PM by moving to better housing on asthma outcomes using principal stratification, a statistical method for causal inference in environmental studies. The proposed study has the potential to have significant implications for the role of housing policy as a tool to address asthma disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma morbidity continues to be a major public health problem among low-income minority children living in urban neighborhoods, and the major contributors are thought to be due to exposures to pest allergens and indoor pollution. Reduction of home allergens and pollution is very difficult in homes in low-income urban neighborhoods where outdoor pollution is high and pest infestation is endemic, and housing mobility programs, which offer counseling and financial assistance for families to move to better neighborhoods, have strong potential to achieve large reductions in allergens and pollutants and thereby reduce asthma morbidity. Through prospectively recruiting and following families as they enter into the Baltimore Housing Mobility Program, we will determine the effect of moving from a low-income urban neighborhood to good quality housing in a better neighborhood on asthma-related outcomes among children with asthma.",The effect of a housing mobility program on environmental exposures and asthma morbidity among low-income minority children,9888210,R01ES026170,"['environmental intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' HEPA Filter ', ' HEPA Filtration ', ' HEPA cleaner ', ' high efficiency particulate air cleaner ', ' high-efficiency particulate air purifier ', ' high efficiency particulate air filter ', ' indoor air pollutant ', ' indoor pollutant ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' indoor allergen ', ' mouse allergen ', ' minority children ', ' Section 8 ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' acute care ', ' indoor PM ', ' indoor air particulate matter ', ' indoor particulate matter ', ' Affect ', ' Allergens ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Baltimore ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cities ', ' Dictyoptera ', ' Cockroaches ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Housing ', ' IgE ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' lung function ', ' respiratory function ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Exhaling ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhalation ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' pollutant ', ' second-hand smoke ', ' second-hand tobacco smoke ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' secondhand tobacco smoke ', ' environmental tobacco smoke ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cockroach allergen ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Modification ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' 17 years of age ', ' age 17 years ', ' seventeen year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' 17 year old ', ' ']",NIEHS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,642119,0.1840893626729233
"Peer-Administered Asthma Self-Management Intervention in Urban Middle Schools Project Summary/Abstract: Health disparities in pediatric asthma persist, with Latino children demonstrating increased asthma morbidity. Middle school children have greater morbidity than children from any other age group, yet there are no school- based asthma management programs developed for this group. To address these gaps, we have developed and piloted a novel group-based intervention: ASMAS (Asthma Self-MAnagement in Schools) in two geographic areas with a high proportion of urban, Latino children with asthma: Providence, Rhode Island, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. ASMAS is a 4-session, peer-facilitated asthma self-management intervention specific to the school setting for Latino middle school (6th-8th graders) children. It is delivered by trained Latino High School Juniors and Seniors with asthma, adapts guidelines-based self-management to the urban school setting, and is consistent with Latino children's cultural backgrounds. In our pilot RCT, ASMAS improved asthma outcomes and self-management for the targeted groups. Our proposed approach involves a hybrid design including a large-scale randomized, controlled trial investigating the effect of ASMAS, and an evaluation of the implementation process to inform future plans to test ASMAS in additional urban settings. Our first aim is to evaluate the effects of ASMAS on asthma health outcomes (e.g., control, symptom free days, absences, lung function) and asthma self-management (skills, knowledge and self-efficacy, availability of rescue inhaler and action plan at school) in a sample of 432 Latino middle school children with asthma in Providence, RI and San Juan, PR (216 per site; 72 per condition). 6th to 8th grade middle schoolers will be enrolled then randomly assigned to 1) ASMAS, or 2) Asthma Education plus Child Health control condition, or 3) a no treatment control condition (9 groups of each condition per site; 8 children per group). Student and primary caregiver assessments will occur at baseline, end of treatment (directly following the intervention), and at three, 4-month post intervention follow-ups. Our second aim is to conduct a mixed-methods, multi-stakeholder process evaluation using the RE-AIM framework,48-50 with students, caregivers, HS Peers, school administrators and additional community stakeholders invested in supporting students' asthma care. We will begin to develop implementation strategies with key stakeholders to better prepare for future large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of ASMAS and its implementation in additional urban centers. Relative to controls, over 1 year, we expect that ASMAS participants will have improved asthma outcomes and self- management. We also expect treatment effects on asthma outcomes will be mediated through changes in self- management in all children, and moderated by acculturative stress and language proficiency in RI children. The proposed work offers a critical opportunity to evaluate ASMAS for improving asthma outcomes for children at high risk on a larger-scale and to develop avenues for sustainability and future dissemination with state and community stakeholders. Project Narrative Health disparities in pediatric asthma persist, with Latino children demonstrating increased asthma morbidity. Middle school children with asthma have greater morbidity than children from any other age group and spend a majority of their day in school, where they must manage any asthma. We developed and piloted a novel group- based intervention - ASMAS (Asthma Self-MAnagement in Schools) in two geographic areas with a high prevalence of urban and Latino children with asthma: Providence, Rhode Island, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. ASMAS is a 4-session, peer-facilitated asthma self-management intervention specific to the school setting for Latino middle school (6th-8th graders) children. It is delivered by trained High School Juniors and Seniors of Latino descent with asthma. We demonstrated the preliminary effects of ASMAS for improving asthma outcomes and self-management relative to controls. In this proposal, we will evaluate ASMAS through a large- scaled Randomized Control Trial with urban middle school students who have persistent asthma in Providence, RI and San Juan, Puerto Rico and we will identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of ASMAS. These results will allow us to prepare for future, large-scale dissemination in other urban school settings.",Peer-Administered Asthma Self-Management Intervention in Urban Middle Schools,9929964,R01MD012225,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Play ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Quality Control ', ' Records ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' lung function ', ' respiratory function ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Administrator ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Penetration ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Sample Size ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' age group ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' 8th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' 11th grade ', ' high school junior ', ' eleventh grade ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' junior high ', ' middle school ', ' junior high school ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Dominican ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' post intervention ', ' pilot trial ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' asthma controller ', ' asthma reliever ', ' rescue inhaler ', ' asthma inhaler ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' treatment effect ', ' high risk ', ' control trial ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' intervention effect ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Middle School Student ', ' attentional control ', ' school district ', ' primary care giver ', ' primary caregiver ', ' urban children ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' urban school ', ' urban setting ', ' Child Health ', ' clinical implementation ', ' implementation strategy ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIMHD,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2020,837568,0.42882070450118714
"Clinic navigation and home visits to improve guideline-based care and outcomes in low income minority adults with asthma PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Asthma-related deaths, hospitalizations, and ED visits are more numerous among low-income and minority patients, including African Americans and among older adults who tend to suffer from other chronic diseases. Guidelines for asthma management have not met the unique needs of this older group with their socioeconomic burdens and frequent comorbidities. We recently demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and evidence of effectiveness of two separate interventions to improve access to care, patient-provider communication, and asthma outcomes: 1) CI: clinic intervention using a patient advocate to prepare for, attend, and confirm understanding of an office visit, and 2) HV: home visits for care coordination and informing clinicians of home barriers to managing asthma. This project explores whether these interventions can be combined for greater effectiveness and better delivery of guideline-based asthma care and outcomes in low-income minority patients. In addition, we explore whether giving clinicians real-time feedback on the patient’s health and home status structured in the framework of adherence to asthma guidelines is associated with subsequent improvement in asthma outcomes. In a randomized controlled factorial trial, 400 adults with uncontrolled asthma living in low-income urban neighborhoods will be offered 18-months participation: 12 months of clinical intervention and 6 months of evaluation to monitor sustainability of interventions and outcomes. Patients will be randomized to (1) patient advocate alone, (2) patient advocate with home visits, (3) patient advocate with real-time feedback to asthma provider (clinician) at each clinic visit of guidelines-relevant elements of a patient’s current care, and (4) both (2) and (3). The interventions will be delivered by a lay Community Health Navigator (CHN). The study will estimate: Specific Aim 1: improvement over time of within-group (before-after in four groups) asthma outcomes (asthma control, quality of life, ED visits, hospitalizations, prednisone bursts) Specific Aim 2: across group differences in improvement over time in asthma outcomes; Specific Aim 3: the costs associated with each of the interventions, and we will conduct a cost-offset analysis to determine which intervention costs are offset by savings attributable to reductions in ED, hospitalization or other visits for asthma control and other outcomes. Exploratory Aim: changes in behavior from the interventions using interviews of clinicians and patients. Hypothesis and Impact: We hypothesize improved outcomes in asthma patients through enhanced communication of patient and clinician, clinician attention to home environmental exposure, and clinician consideration of the guidelines, at a program cost offset by lower patient health care utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE Few interventions to improve asthma management have targeted low-income minority asthmatic adults, particularly older adults who often also have other health problems. National guidelines focus on children and young adults leaving asthma providers with little evidence-based data to guide clinical decisions for adult patients with multiple comorbidities. This project tests guideline-promoted interventions, delivered by community health navigators in clinical practices and in the home, with feedback to clinicians, to improve asthma control and quality of life for adults with uncontrolled asthma recruited from clinics serving low-income urban neighborhoods.",Clinic navigation and home visits to improve guideline-based care and outcomes in low income minority adults with asthma,9932485,R01HL143364,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Appointment ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hearing ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Housing ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Prednisone ', ' 1, 2-Dehydrocortisone ', ' Dehydrocortisone ', ' Delta(1)-Cortisone ', ' Deltacortisone ', ' Deltadehydrocortisone ', ' Metacortandracin ', ' Prednisonum ', ' delta-Cortisone ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Steroids ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Voice ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Visit ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' Home visitation ', ' cost ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' home environmental exposure ', ' household environmental exposure ', ' asthmatic ', ' improved outcome ', ' HAP2 ', ' Huntingtin-Associated protein 1 ', ' recruit ', ' program costs ', ' intervention cost ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,799270,0.3592083379020448
"Improving Patient-Centered Outcomes after Discharge among Patients Hospitalized with Asthma Exacerbations by Focusing on a Transition-to-Home Plan with Community Health Workers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic disease, affecting more than 10% of American children (>7 million children <18 years)1 and disproportionately impacting urban, minority, and disadvantaged children.2 Despite the evidence-based guidelines for standardized care from the NIH,3 overall morbidity among youth with asthma, whether measured by attack rates, emergency department (ED) visits, or hospitalizations, has not significantly decreased in the last decade.4 Striking disparities persist among youth with asthma, as socio- economically disadvantaged, urban, and minority children throughout the United States incur a disproportionate share of asthma-related morbidity.2,5 The overall ED visit rate for asthma, for example, among non-Hispanic African Americans (AAs) aged 0-17 years is 4.1 times greater than that among non-Hispanic whites, while the ED visit rate among Hispanics in the same age group is 1.8 times greater than non-Hispanic whites. Similarly, the asthma death rate among non-Hispanic AAs aged 0-17 years is 7.3 times greater than that among non-Hispanic whites, while the death rate among Hispanics in the same age group is 1.2 times greater than non-Hispanic whites.5 In a recent study to prioritize comparative effectiveness research in hospital pediatrics, asthma ranked as the #1 leading non-surgical diagnose for pediatric hospital admission, totaling costs of $570 million annually.6 Of striking importance for the health care system is that asthma is also in the top diagnoses for all-cause readmissions, with 80% of these asthma readmissions deemed potentially preventable readmissions.7 In this career training award, with a strong mentorship team, I propose a highly patient-centered approach to identifying and improving optimal outcomes for patients and families transitioning home after inpatient admissions for asthma exacerbations. Using the care coordination framework proposed by the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in June 2014,8 my mentors and I will utilize principles of patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) and comparative effectiveness research (CER) to design and pilot a program of community health worker (CHW)-facilitated transition-to-home focusing on the changeover of care from inpatient to outpatient for patients hospitalized with asthma exacerbation. This project is highly significant (addressing a vulnerable transition for patients admitted with a common and costly pediatric chronic illness with high rate of preventable readmissions) and highly innovative (using a qualitative approach to identify stakeholders' perspectives to refine AHRQ's care coordination framework to improve the transition from hospital to home by utilizing CHW and pilot testing feasibility and acceptability, and patient-centered outcomes). Our overall aim is to develop and evaluate a patient-centered transition-to-home plan leveraging CHWs to target high risk pediatric patients requiring hospital admission for asthma exacerbations. Our hypothesis is that CHWs will improve patient-centered outcomes during the transition from inpatient to outpatient care.

"Evaluation of the Asthma Management Program to Promote Activity for Students in Schools (Asthma-PASS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Asthma prevalence in Bronx, NY schools is 20-25%. Physical activity (PA) is an important component of asthma management in children. Studies show that PA is associated with decreased severity of asthma symptoms, as well as improved disease control and quality of life. However, urban minority children with asthma face barriers to PA on multiple levels. In our prior work (K23HD065742), we identified several barriers to PA in urban minority schoolchildren with asthma. These barriers include: inadequate access to asthma rescue medications in school, suboptimal prescribing of preventive asthma therapy by primary care physicians (PCPs), lack of school PA opportunities, stigma associated with asthma, parent/child fear of an asthma attack with PA, and lack of teacher confidence in assisting students with asthma. We developed a novel Asthma management program to Promote Activity for Students in Schools (Asthma-PASS) in collaboration with stakeholders to address these key barriers. We pilot tested Asthma-PASS with 109 students with asthma from 4 Bronx elementary schools and their parents to demonstrate proof of concept and preliminary evidence of intervention effectiveness. Results from the pilot study demonstrated significantly greater increase in symptom-free days (SFDs) (primary outcome measure) and PA levels. In addition, preliminary mediation analyses suggested vigorous PA and step counts are mediators of SFDs. We now plan to build upon this work and evaluate in a full-scale randomized trial whether the Asthma- PASS intervention reduces asthma morbidity among high-risk urban schoolchildren. We propose a cluster- randomized controlled trial with 416 children ages 5-11 years with persistent or uncontrolled asthma from 26 Bronx schools. Schools will be stratified by size and then randomly assigned to either (1) the Asthma-PASS intervention (PCP collaboration to ensure optimal guideline-based preventive asthma care and community health workers to facilitate rescue medication availability in school and provide asthma awareness programming and education for children, parents and school personnel to reduce stigma around asthma and PA) or (2) an asthma management (AM) comparison group (PCP and parent notification of child’s asthma status and general asthma education). Both groups will participate in an existing district-wide classroom-based daily activity program (‘Move to Improve’). We will assess the effectiveness of Asthma-PASS in reducing asthma morbidity (primary outcome - SFDs), and improving PA (secondary outcome) as well as additional clinical and functional outcomes. We will measure PA with accelerometers using previously established procedures. We will also identify potential mediators and moderators of the intervention effect. We will evaluate the process of intervention implementation by applying the RE-AIM framework. This proposal directly builds on our prior work in schools to improve asthma outcomes and reduce health disparities. If Asthma-PASS successfully reduces symptoms and improves health, it will provide a powerful argument for policy change in schools and urban communities nationwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although physical activity is an important component of pediatric asthma management, urban minority children with asthma face many barriers to participation in sports and other forms of physical activity. The current study may have a profound impact on public health because it aims to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of a novel school-based intervention that addresses key barriers to physical activity in urban minority children with asthma. Should the intervention prove successful in reducing symptoms and improving health of urban children with asthma, it has the potential to serve as a model for improved asthma care in urban communities.",Evaluation of the Asthma Management Program to Promote Activity for Students in Schools (Asthma-PASS),9974906,R61HL147908,"['Absenteeism ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Exercise ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Maintenance ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' New York ', ' Parents ', ' Physical Education ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' school health ', ' health in school ', ' Schools ', ' Sports ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' teacher ', ' pulmonary function ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Notification ', ' Severities ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' meetings ', ' inner city ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' physical state ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' intense exercise ', ' strenuous activity ', ' strenuous physical activity ', ' vigorous exercise ', ' vigorous physical activity ', ' Strenuous Exercise ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' comparator group ', ' comparison group ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' intervention effect ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' urban children ', ' minority children ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' urban school ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' social factors ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NHLBI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R61,2020,867721,0.42129090954990817
"Rhode Island Asthma Integrated Response Program (RI-AIR) Project Summary/Abstract: Greater Providence, Rhode Island is comprised of several urban “core” cities of high poverty and significant pediatric asthma disparity. The RI-Asthma Integrated Response (RI-AIR) Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP) is a comprehensive system of identification, screening and intervention for pediatric asthma. Core components include: a 1) state of the art technology platform (the RI-AIR information data system, or RI-AIR IDS) to integrate data from LifeChart (EHR), REDCap (research data system), and KIDSNet (state-based database of child health information), 2) algorithm for stratification of asthma management services based on level of asthma control/risk, 3) multilevel school-based education (CASE) to family/child/school system for children whose asthma is not well-controlled, 4) intensive home-based intervention (HARP) for children with poorly controlled asthma, and 5) enhanced coordination between caregiver, school nurse, and health care provider to promote integration across sectors of care. The first aim of the proposed work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the RI-AIR ACIP using a randomized, stepped wedge design. During Years 2-4, we will provide our intervention sequentially to sixteen high-risk communities involving approximately 1500 urban, ethnically diverse children (aged 2-12) with asthma and their families. We will evaluate both individual-level (e.g., asthma control) and community-specific outcomes (i.e., rates of ED a multi-level process evaluation of the RI-AIR ACIP during implementation (Years 2-5). We will assess penetration within identified communities and school districts, and evaluate characteristics of families that accept and complete the intervention vs. those who do not. We will determine fidelity of the RI-AIR IDS technology platform in assigning interventions according to asthma control/risk, and treatment fidelity and dose delivered of the HARP and CASE programs. We will use focus groups and provider surveys to determine facilitators of and barriers to visits) for children with asthma. The second aim of this application involves conducting effective implementation. The third aim involves conducting a mixed-methods evaluation of the sustainability of the RI-AIR ACIP, with ongoing input from our community stakeholders during Years 5-6. We define sustainability as continued capacity, continued activities, and continued benefits. We expect over 1 year, participants receiving the RI-AIR ACIP will have improved asthma control and fewer symptom free days relative to baseline. We expect over 1 year, relative to baseline, caregivers will have improved asthma knowledge, self-efficacy, asthma QOL, and indicators of effective disease management. We expect over 1 year, communities receiving the RI-AIR ACIP will have reduced ED visits and hospitalizations relative to their baseline year, and relative to targeted communities that have not yet received RI-AIR. We plan to demonstrate that RI-AIR ACIP is a replicable, evidence-based and cost-saving model that improves asthma outcomes for children at most risk, and can be disseminated to other urban communities to address asthma disparities. Project Narrative Pediatric asthma is a significant public health problem. Striking asthma disparities continue despite available clinical guidelines to manage asthma in home and school settings. There is a crucial need for coordinated systems of asthma care. This proposal will evaluate the effectiveness of the RI-Asthma Integrated Response (RI-AIR) Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP), a comprehensive system of identification, screening and intervention for pediatric asthma, targeted toward high-risk communities in greater Providence, RI. The RI- AIR ACIP is based on home and school interventions for pediatric asthma that have established efficacy, with input from the RI-AIR Collaborative, an established group of key stakeholders involved in the care of children with asthma in the state.

"A Coping Skills Intervention for Low-SES Latino Families of Children with Asthma PROJECT SUMMARY Latino children experience disparities in asthma control and have worse functional outcomes related to poorly controlled asthma compared to non-Latino White children, including more school absences, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations for asthma. These disparities persist despite the benefits of asthma self- management interventions. A significant and growing percentage of Latino children live in poverty, which further increases their risk for uncontrolled asthma. For low-SES Latino children, psychosocial stress is an unaddressed factor in asthma disparities. Existing interventions rarely target psychosocial processes to address the role of stress in asthma control. However, research on coping offers insight into potential intervention approaches that would buffer the effects of stress and reduce asthma disparities for low-SES Latino children. Coping is a key modifiable factor that lies “midstream” between upstream social determinants of health and downstream disparities in health outcomes. In particular, secondary control coping (i.e., efforts to accommodate/adapt to stressors, such as acceptance and cognitive restructuring) has been linked to better asthma control for children in low-SES contexts. Therefore, the purpose of the current R01 proposal is to test the effectiveness and mediators of Adapt 2 Asthma (A2A), a bilingual family-based coping skills + asthma management intervention tailored to the stressors, strengths, and cultural beliefs of low-SES Latino families. 280 low-SES Latino families of children ages 9-13 years old with asthma will be identified and enrolled from community primary care clinics and randomly assigned to either A2A or a standard asthma self-management (AM) control arm. We will assess children’s asthma control, quality of life, lung function, school absences, and emergency department visits as the outcomes of the intervention. We will also examine child mediational pathways (child coping and mood and behavior symptoms) and parent mediational pathways (parent coping and depressive symptoms) of the intervention. Assessments will occur at pre- and post-intervention and at 6 and 12-month follow-up timepoints using child and parent report, spirometry, and school records. The successful completion of this R01 would provide evidence of the effectiveness and mediators of A2A for low-SES Latino children, a population underserved by current intervention approaches. Our results are expected to lead to a subsequent multi-site implementation trial of A2A in primary care. The long-term goal of this line of research is to reduce disparities in asthma control and its health consequences affecting low-SES Latino children and similar underserved youth populations. The knowledge gained would improve the health of low-SES Latino children and reduce the public health burden related to pediatric asthma, a condition with a significant cost to society. PROJECT NARRATIVE Uncontrolled asthma in school-aged children is a significant public health problem. Low-SES Latino children are at increased risk for uncontrolled asthma compared to non-Latino white children, and psychosocial stress is an unaddressed factor in this disparity.

"Understanding Mechanisms Underlying Chronic Stress-Induced Asthma in Children by Population and Single-Cell Epigenomics Approaches SUMMARY Asthma is a severe long-term disease of the lungs affecting millions of children in the US. An infection by Rhinovirus (RV) is the most common trigger of an asthma attack which can be life threating for children with a pre-existing condition. There are significant racial and ethnic disparities in asthma-related conditions where African American and Hispanic children are more likely to have a diagnosis of asthma and significantly higher asthma-related morbidity in comparisons with non-Hispanic white children. Genetic factors alone or in combination with differences in environment exposures or lifestyle are important but have not been able to fully explain observed disparities. Social environment such as chronic stressors experienced by racial and ethnic minority groups have been linked to increased susceptibility to infection and chronic illness including asthma. We hypothesize that social disadvantages during childhood result in long-lasting epigenetic alterations in key regulatory regions impacting immune cell gene function that negatively impacts antiviral defense and subsequently increase the risk of asthma. Our goal is to combine population-based epigenome mapping in nasal mucosa with single immune cell analysis in large pediatric asthma cohorts of African American children with detailed information about asthma and viral status as well as chronic stress exposures of several domains. In Aim 1, we will implement an epigenome enrichment assay using our Methylation Capture Sequencing approach to query the complete functional methylome in nasal mucosa (estimated to cover ~3M dynamic CpGs) derived from thousands of children. We will deploy the approach in well-characterized pediatric cohorts to explore predictive power of nasal epigenome signatures to capture chronic stress, viral infection along with asthma phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will profile the immune cell landscape by high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenome assays at single-cell resolution in hundreds of children with asthma. We will focus our single-cell profiling efforts in blood derived from RV infected children that are exposed to high vs. low levels of chronic stress to characterize immune cell signaling and viral response mechanisms epigenetically altered as a consequence of social experiences. In Aim 3, we will perform in vitro validations of RV response in primary macrophages differentiated from circulating monocytes from children that are discordant for chronic stress exposure. We will perform detailed single-cell transcriptome and epigenome mapping before and after in vitro infection with RV which will allow us to quantify the effects of social disadvantages on immune gene expression at baseline and in response to RV infection. Overall, our program will provide new insight into how genes and the social environment combine to influence heterogeneity in the response to environmental stressors and contribute to the health disparity seen in children with asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is a severe chronic illness in childhood triggered by viral infections and with significant racial disparities. To examine how exposure to social stress is linked to pathophysiology of the disease, we use high-resolution epigenetic approaches at population and single-cell level to reveal epigenetic changes in immune cells predicting antiviral response and development of asthma.",Understanding Mechanisms Underlying Chronic Stress-Induced Asthma in Children by Population and Single-Cell Epigenomics Approaches,10053566,R01MD015409,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', ' anti-viral agents ', ' anti-viral drugs ', ' anti-virals ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Diathesis ', ' liability to disease ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' macrophage ', ' Maps ', ' Methylation ', ' Minority Groups ', ' monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Morbidity -

"West Philadelphia Asthma Care Implementation Plan Project Summary/Abstract:  The Community Asthma Prevention Program (CAPP) has a two-decade history of utilizing CHWs to improve asthma outcomes of children in Philadelphia. Building on this foundation, we established a network of stakeholders, The West Philadelphia Asthma Care Collaborative (WEPACC), with representation from public housing, healthcare, community, and schools. As a result of assessment of local needs, resource mapping, and months of planning, we designed an asthma care implementation program with the broad objective of integrating home, school, healthcare system, and community for school-aged asthmatic children in West Philadelphia. We will accomplish this goal using CHWs to deliver sustainable patient-centered evidence- based interventions. The evidence-based interventions include (1) a primary care-based Yes We Can intervention with home visitation and (2) a comprehensive and rigorously evaluated school-based intervention, Open Airways for schools and School Based Asthma Therapy. CHWs will function as the hub of each interventions, serving either as primary care CHWs or school CHWs to provide a network of education, care coordination support, and to facilitate communication for families of children with asthma between the four sectors. This project is innovative in that it seeks to integrate interventions in a comprehensive and sustainable manner to reduce asthma disparities in poor, minority children.  Using a factorial design, we will recruit and randomize 600 asthmatic children (ages 6-12 years) from three inner-city primary care clinics who attend one of 23 West Philadelphia schools to one of four study conditions: both interventions (both primary care and school CHWs intervention), primary care CHW or school- CHW alone, or control and follow for one year. We will accomplish the following objectives: Specific Aim 1. Compare effectiveness of the primary care and school interventions to improve asthma control and reduce symptom days using main and simple effects from the factorial design. Specific Aim 2. Explore moderators and mechanisms of effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions. Specific Aim 3. Use mixed methods to explore implementation determinants and outcomes of school intervention that promote effectiveness, fidelity and sustainability Specific Aim 4. Examine the costs, savings, and cost effectiveness associated with the intervention and implementation strategies to promote sustainability 1 Project Narrative: This project uses community health workers or lay health educators to implement asthma interventions that have been proven to work in order to connect the caregiver, community, school and health sectors.

"New Approaches for Empowering Studies of Asthma in Populations of African Descent Asthma is a complex disease with striking disparities across racial and ethnic groups, which may be partly attributable to genetic factors. A major goal of the Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA) has been to discover genes conferring risk to asthma in populations of African ancestry. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying genes associated with increased risk of asthma, but there is a substantial gap between associations discovered by GWAS and understanding how these loci control disease. A major portion of the `missing heritability' could be due to variants with smaller effects missed by traditional GWAS thresholds, emphasizing the need for a transition to integrative genetics, where transcriptome, proteome, methylome and metabolome information are brought into a unified framework. Our goal in this continuing renewal is to apply an integrative, multi-omics approach to understand the molecular architecture underlying asthma, building upon the 5-year CAAPA program, where >16,000 asthmatics and non-asthmatics have already been GWAS-genotyped, and GWAS and/or whole genome sequencing (WGS) data are available on more than 100,000 non-CAAPA samples. We propose to test if genetic variants control development of asthma by regulating gene transcription and expression, DNA methylation, metabolic profiles, and proteome variation. The specific aims of this application leverage an international group of investigators with diverse but highly integrated areas of expertise, and include the following: (1) expand and integrate multi-omic resources for asthma research in African Diaspora populations and identify novel genetic determinants for risk of asthma by adding indigenous American and continental African genetic representation in the African Diaspora catalog, building a multi-omic repository through newly generated transcriptome, methylome, proteome, and metabolome data from CAAPA asthmatics and unaffected controls with existing GWAS data from 7 sites in North and South America, the Caribbean and Africa, and performing integrative analyses; (2) broadly disseminate CAAPA results through a web-based resource that empowers the asthma research community for new discoveries; and (3) develop and apply approaches for prioritizing CAAPA results in 3 health systems biobanks enriched for US minority populations (Nashville, New York City, and the Rocky Mountain region) by examining genomics (PheWAS) and multi-omics (PrediXcan) asthma associations identified in CAAPA and non-CAAPA datasets. These studies will advance our understanding of the molecular basis for asthma among populations of African ancestry. The Consortium on Asthma among African-ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA) will expand and build a multi-omics repository in populations with African ancestry, from continental Africa and the Americas, for integrative analysis to empower discovery and functional interpretation of asthma genetic risk. We will also implement web-based technologies to develop an online community resource for asthma researchers, and investigate the impact of asthma loci in three large health systems. Overall, this work will inform the genetic and clinical asthma communities about how to implement genetic discovery using high dimensional data in a clinically useful and technologically innovative manner.",New Approaches for Empowering Studies of Asthma in Populations of African Descent,9837463,R01HL104608,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Americas ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Gabon ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Control Locus ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' New York City ', ' Nigeria ', ' North America ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Phenotype ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' South America ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' density ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Central American ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' South American ', ' Complex ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Proteome ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Heritability ', ' discover genes ', ' gene discovery ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' Secure ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' methylome ', ' asthmatic ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' online community ', ' multiomics ', ' multiple omics ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' metabolic profile ', ' metabonome ', ' metabolome ', ' SNP chip ', ' single nucleotide polymorphism array ', ' single nucleotide polymorphism chip ', ' SNP array ', ' Indigenous American ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' online resource ', ' population stratification ', ' web-based tool ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' web server ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' structured data ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,2310070,0.39603111477976854
"Asthma symptom perception feedback intervention for ethnic minority adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under-perception of asthma symptoms in children is a major risk factor for emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and near-fatal/fatal asthma attacks. Puerto Rican and Black children have greater asthma morbidity and mortality rates than all other racial/ethnic groups. Interventions targeting asthma symptom perception and medication adherence may help close this asthma health disparities gap. There are no RCT studies to date designed to improve asthma symptom perception in ethnic minority children. This R01 study builds upon this new investigator PI's prior grants. We demonstrated that children who did not receive peak expiratory flow (PEF) feedback under-perceived asthma symptoms 42% of the time vs. 15% for the PEF feedback group and had lower controller medication adherence (27.5% vs. 48.8%).  The proposed randomized controlled trial consists of two arms: PEF feedback (N = 130) versus control feedback (N = 130). Latino and Black adolescents with asthma ages 10-17 years old and their caregivers will be recruited from clinics in the Bronx, NY. The primary aims are to examine the efficacy of PEF prediction with feedback versus control feedback on 1) under-perception of asthma symptoms 2) controller medication adherence and 3) asthma control and emergency health care use. These aims will be examined across a 1- year follow-up. An exploratory aim examines the hypothesized pathway that the PEF intervention reduces under-perception of symptoms, shifts illness representations toward the professional model and increases adolescents' and parents' asthma management self-efficacy, resulting in greater medication adherence and improved asthma control. The baseline visit for all families consists of standardized asthma education followed by 3 weeks of PEF prediction without feedback using a programmable, electronic spirometer. Participants then will be randomized to intervention group and their spirometer reprogrammed, showing either the actual PEF and daily asthma management messages (PEF feedback group) or a brief, positive message (control feedback group). For the next 6 weeks, all adolescents will predict their PEF, which will be locked in before blowing into the device. Families will return at mid-intervention and post-intervention to receive verbal individualized feedback on symptom perception and problem-solving skills training (PEF feedback group) or supportive counseling (control feedback group). All adolescents will play ""Quest for the Code"" to reinforce the baseline asthma education. At the post-intervention visit, the spirometer will be reprogrammed for all adolescents to provide no feedback for the next 4 weeks. These symptom perception data will be downloaded at 1-month post-intervention. Controller medication adherence will be monitored by electronic devices. Post-intervention sessions will take place at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to collect adherence data and conduct spirometry. Physicians will be blinded to group assignment and rate asthma control using national guidelines. A 12-month retrospective medical record abstraction will compare emergency health care use for asthma between groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An intervention to improve asthma symptom perception has great potential to reduce the immense ethnic disparities that exist in asthma outcomes. Prediction of peak expiratory flow followed by feedback can be applied on a large-scale level due to the accessibility of peak flow meters, brevity of the intervention, and immediate learning effects. Guessing peak expiratory flow can be appealing for adolescents, and it does not require any cultural adaptation due to the common language of peak expiratory flow.",Asthma symptom perception feedback intervention for ethnic minority adolescents,9840937,R01HL128260,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticoids ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Bronchodilator Agents ', ' Bronchial-Dilating Agents ', ' Bronchodilators ', ' lumen dilator ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Counseling ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Records ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' lung function ', ' respiratory function ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Spirometry ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Vital capacity ', ' Forced Vital Capacity ', ' Work ', ' Bronchoconstriction ', ' Bronchial Constriction ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Self Management ', ' Blinded ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean region ', ' pulmonary function ', ' Mexican ', ' Fostering ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' meter ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' skills training ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dominican ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Peak Expiratory Flow ', ' Monitor ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Numerical value ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' post intervention ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' 17 years of age ', ' age 17 years ', ' seventeen year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' 17 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' individualized feedback ', ' arm ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' minority children ', ' Cuban ', ' recruit ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' ']",NHLBI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,644792,0.3036420687833609
"Implementation of a multilevel program to reduce asthma symptoms in urban preschoolers Despite a strong evidence-base for the efficacy of asthma care intervention programs in reducing asthma morbidity among low-income minority children, gaps remain in our understanding of how best to translate and scale up these efficacious interventions into sustainable, broad-based programs that reduce known asthma health disparities. Head Start (HS) serves over one million low income children each year by focusing on early learning, physical health, and family and is committed to implementing evidence based programs to promote overall child wellbeing. It is unknown how to best scale up and implement these evidence based asthma interventions into low resource community organizations that serve children at risk. Implementation strategies are frequently developed atheoretically and may not be tailored to the setting. MD ABC Asthma is a multilevel asthma program that includes both staff and family asthma education training as well an integrated care with medical providers. The overall purpose of this project is to inform best practices of implementation of an asthma education program by 1) systematically evaluating the use of intervention mapping to develop a tailored implementation strategy in partnership with Head Start stakeholders, 2) examining both staff and organizational level determinants associated with implementation of MD ABC Asthma, and 3) evaluating the success of tailored implementation strategies on implementation outcomes and school absences and other health outcomes.. As part of this implementation, we will conduct a multiphase sequential mixed methods study to inform and evaluate the implementation process using the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research (CFIR). Aim1 will focus on a pre-implementation evaluation of Head Start staff and directors to inform a tailored implementation strategy using intervention mapping. Aims 2 will be an ongoing evaluation and support of the implementation process using a sequential mixed methods approach. Aim 3 will identify both staff and organizational determinants of implementation outcomes to inform national scalability within Head Start. Results will identify innovative methods for implementation and sustainability in low resource settings by partnering with existing community and government agencies as well as evaluate the impact effectiveness of an integrated multilevel asthma program, school absences, asthma control, and healthcare utilization. Successful implementation of this effective intervention has the potential to be included in federal guidelines and integrated into national guidelines on management of asthma nationally through the Office of Head Start. Despite a strong evidence-base for the efficacy of asthma care intervention programs in reducing asthma morbidity among low-income minority children, gaps remain in our understanding of how best to translate and scale up these efficacious interventions into sustainable, broad-based programs that reduce known asthma health disparities.

"Reducing Asthma Attacks in Disadvantaged School Children with Asthma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our re-submission proposal, “Reducing Asthma Attacks in Disadvantaged School Children with Asthma,” seeks broad-scale implementation of our effective school-based approach to improve asthma disparities for children in low-income communities (ages 5 to 12 years). Using community-based participatory methods with high risk populations and communities, we will contextualize dissemination and implementation (D&I) of our Colorado school-based asthma program (Col-SBAP) that reduces asthma exacerbations and missed school days, while also addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) which our pilot identified as major drivers of asthma disparities. We will evaluate key metrics identified by diverse stakeholders during a dissemination trial in rural and small metropolitan areas of Colorado. Our dissemination trial will include two interventions: our evidence-based Col-SBAP and an evidence-based assessment and management approach to key SDOH. Our pilot data show both interventions are critical to improve asthma disparities for children from low income families. This two-step level of intervention, called Stop Asthma Attacks (SAA), will be designed for sustainable delivery by school asthma navigators and school nurses who coordinate with primary care and community resources. In partnership with our community stakeholders, the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) D&I framework will be applied during the UG3 planning phase to iteratively adapt our current implementation guide to tailored implementation plans that meet local community and site-specific needs, resources and priorities (EPIS Phases 1 & 2). We will then conduct a UH3 dissemination trial with a randomized stepped-wedge study design in asthma “hot spot” school systems across five Colorado regions to evaluate implementation strategies across asthma “hot spot” school systems (EPIS phase 3, UH3 trial) and to apply the work from EPIS phases 1-3 to develop a “dissemination playbook” to guide future program adoption by other school systems (EPIS Phase 4). The central hypothesis is that SAA will have broad and equitable Reach (primary outcome), and yield important benefits in reducing asthma attacks and symptoms, as compared to schools that have not yet implemented SAA. The SAA playbook will be designed to promote the sustainable adoption of SAA, including training materials and a calculation of return on investment. Our proposal is responsive to and addresses key elements of NHLBI HL-20-003 by “testing late-stage (T4) implementation research strategies” and “promoting and improving population health in high- burden communities” by using a public health approach to target “hot spot” schools with high levels of uncontrolled asthma and asthma associated burden. This proposal will both include a rigorous stakeholder engagement process to ensure SAA is disseminated to diverse geopolitical areas of Colorado with attention to sustainability. Collectively, this evaluation and playbook will accelerate dissemination of SAA nationally to communities experiencing health inequities in pediatric asthma care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is a leading cause of children’s hospitalizations, missed school days and caregivers’ missed work days that has a significant impact on low income families. We seek to increase asthma control for children with uncontrolled asthma and health disparities, in order to improve the outcomes of activity, symptoms, and reduce asthma exacerbations. We will evaluate whether two interventions, an evidence-based school asthma program and an assessment of social determinants of health, with the aid of an asthma navigator and school nurse champion can be disseminated and implemented in other school settings to reduce the risk of asthma attacks.",Reducing Asthma Attacks in Disadvantaged School Children with Asthma,10063661,UG3HL151297,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Cities ', ' Colorado ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Investments ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' school health ', ' health in school ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Healthcare Quality Indicators ', ' Health Care Quality Indicators ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' metropolitan ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Preparation ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Process ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' dissemination trial ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' burden to community ', ' community burden ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based program ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' screening ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' school district ', ' improved outcome ', ' minority student ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' lower income families ', ' implementation strategy ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,UG3,2020,744301,0.4711873407210106
"An Asthma Collaboration to Reduce Childhood Asthma Disparities on the Navajo Nation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Asthma prevalence among children on the Navajo Nation, the largest tribal reservation in the United States, is 2-3 times that of the general population and fueled by health disparities that include devastating poverty, multiple environmental pollutants, and large travel distances to obtain healthcare. Delivery of evidence-based asthma care through the Indian Health Service (IHS), the only healthcare system on the reservation, is inconsistent. While schools and communities identify pediatric asthma as a strong concern, no comprehensive asthma care implementation plan has been previously introduced. Therefore, this proposed study will combine two previously tested programs, one focused on training providers and one on school-based education and monitoring, to build a comprehensive, integrated, team-based Asthma Care Implementation Program to address medical care, family, home, and community to improve the health of Navajo children with asthma. A one-year engagement phase has resulted in strong support from Navajo Nation organizations including the President and Vice President of the Navajo Nation, governmental organizations, healthcare centers, schools, and communities in the three participating agencies (Fort Defiance, Chinle, and Tuba City). Approval of the proposed study by the Navajo Nation Human Research Review Board has been obtained. Key recommendations from communities including use of existing resources such as the Navajo Epidemiology Center, Navajo Health Department, local media, lay health workers, and ongoing involvement of stakeholders are included in this plan. Using a stepped-wedge design, the intervention will be introduced sequentially into three agencies. A mixed-methods analysis strategy will be employed that includes annual examination of asthma exacerbations through the IHS database (primary outcome), interviews with 300 families with a child with asthma, and key informant interviews with healthcare providers and school teachers and nurses. During the sustainability phase, meetings will be held with multiple organizations including local chapter houses to share outcome data, gather feedback, and plan for future dissemination to other agencies and reservations. The RE-AIM framework will be employed to evaluate the implementation process and facilitate dissemination to other tribal populations.

"Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication and Social Adversity (ASTHMA) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Pediatric asthma has a substantial public health burden with numerous contributing risk factors in the physical, social, and health care environments. This burden is elevated among low-income minority children living in urban areas, related in part to multi-factorial residential exposures. There are numerous complex feedback loops among risk factors, with interventions potentially inducing behavioral responses that modify levels of other risk factors. Given these characteristics, pediatric asthma is an ideal candidate for systems science tools to prioritize among risk factors and design intervention strategies. However, there have been few applications of systems science techniques to asthma, and no applications to date that take account of multiple risk factors with housing, social and behavioral components. Discrete event simulation (DES), a systems science approach that involves modeling a complex system in which individuals can be tracked over time, multiple attributes can be incorporated simultaneously, and interactions and non-linear effects can be incorporated, is ideally suited for this application. This project (the Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication, and Social Adversity - ASTHMA) builds upon the only DES model of pediatric asthma or the physical environment, leveraging data from a longstanding electronic health record (EHR) database, and extensive neighborhood contextual data available from a BU center of environmental health disparities. Building on prior expertise and the strength of an established interdisciplinary team we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: To build the Boston Children’s Healthcare Disparities Repository (BCHDR), a large database of predominantly low-income and racial/ethnic minority asthmatic children extracted from the BMC EHR, and use it to develop associations among key predictors of lung function, medication prescription and adherence, social adversity, asthma outcomes, and healthcare utilization. Aim 2: To predict exposure to indoor pollutants and environmental conditions across a range of housing types, resident behaviors, and sociodemographic characteristics, in a manner useful for DES modeling. Aim 3: To expand the existing DES model to capture the variability in housing, sociodemographic, and neighborhood environments for asthmatic children in the BCHDR, and evaluate the influence of implemented or proposed policies addressing housing conditions, medication adherence, and aspects of social adversity on asthma outcomes. These data and methods collectively allow us to develop unique insights about the individual and cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on asthma outcomes, as well as about how candidate interventions would influence asthma outcomes given the multiple pathways and complex behavioral responses. While we focus on data specific to Boston to ensure internal consistency, our methods and insights will generalize to other urban settings, our housing modeling approach can be expanded to any are in the US, and our discrete event simulation code and methodology for extracting and analyzing clinical and social risk factor data from an EHR could be adapted to other circumstances. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication, and Social Adversity (ASTHMA) will yield a simulation model that can characterize the effects of indoor environmental exposures, social risk factors, medication adherence, and neighborhood contextual factors on asthma outcomes among low-income children. ASTHMA will incorporate indoor air quality models, building simulations, statistical models using medical and social adversity data from electronic health records, and GIS derived neighborhood contextual variables, with sufficient data to characterize feedback loops and interactions among risk factors. We will develop insight about how candidate interventions – related to housing construction and management, community, individual, and public housing policies – in low-income housing can influence chemical exposures, social stressors, and corresponding health outcomes.","Asthma Simulation Tool for Housing, Medication and Social Adversity (ASTHMA)",9967002,R01ES027816,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' Boston ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child health care ', ' child healthcare ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Housing ', ' Humidity ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' Publishing ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' lung function ', ' respiratory function ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Indoor Air Quality ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' stressor ', ' pollutant ', ' Structure ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Published Database ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Department of Energy ', ' Characteristics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' electronic data ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' community intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' intervention effect ', ' simulation software ', ' indoor air pollutant ', ' indoor pollutant ', ' asthmatic ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral response ', ' model building ', ' minority children ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' PM2.5 ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' fine particles ', ' data resource ', ' urban setting ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' ventilation ', ' social stressor ', ' ']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,489385,0.30352371910305587
"A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention for Rural Latino Children K23 Abstract A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention  for Rural Latino Children DESCRIPTION: Rural Latino children with asthma suffer high rates of uncontrolled asthma symptoms, emergency department visits, and repeat hospitalizations. This vulnerable population must negotiate micro and macro level challenges that impact asthma management, including language barriers, primary care access, parental time off from work, insurance coverage, distance from specialty sites, and documentation status. There are few proven interventions that address asthma management embedded within this unique context. Using a bio-ecological approach, we will determine the feasibility of a patient-centered collaborative program between rural Latino children with asthma and their families, school based nursing, and primary care providers, facilitated by the use of a smart phone based mobile application (mobile app) with a Spanish-language interface. We hypothesize that improving communication through a collaborative, patient-centered intervention will improve asthma management, empower the patient and family, decrease outcome disparities, and decrease direct and indirect costs. The specific aims of this study include: 1) Produce and validate a Spanish translation of an existing asthma management app and evaluate its usability with Latino parents of children with asthma; 2) Develop and evaluate a triadic, patient-centered asthma intervention preliminary protocol, facilitated by the bilingual mobile app validated in aim 1; and 3) Investigate the feasibility of the patient-centered asthma intervention from aim 2 using a wait list randomized control trial (RCT) to investigate the effects of the intervention on school days missed and medication adherence. The results of this study will be used to support a full scale randomized control trial R01 grant application in Year 4 of this award. The career development award will provide Dr. Estrada the mentoring and training needed to develop knowledge and skills in rural asthma disparities research, intervention development and program evaluation, and integration of technology- based interventions. At the close of the award, she will be positioned to design, implement, and evaluate research that will significantly impact rural asthma disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is growing evidence that rural asthma rates are similar to urban asthma rates, yet prior research has focused on urban population groups and interventions. Additionally, rural Latino children with asthma have unique challenges and barriers that contribute to health outcomes disparities.

"Physical Activity and Dose of Air Pollution in Pediatric Urban Asthma: Impact of Minute Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY  Exposure to traffic related air pollution (TRAP) is known to trigger childhood asthma symptoms and likely contributes to the disparity in asthma prevalence and morbidity in urban communities. Regular physical activity can improve asthma symptoms. However, increased minute ventilation (ie respiratory rate x tidal volume) during activity may increase deposition of pollutant particles into the airways. Thus, pollution may offset the respiratory benefits of physical activity. One of the challenges of accurately assessing the combined effects of pollution and activity on the airways is that inhaled dose of pollutants could vary by proximity to exposure source and by individual differences in minute ventilation. Therefore, our objective is take an individualized approach to assess change in minute ventilation during childhood activities while also considering variability in home and school exposure to TRAP.  We hypothesize that the positive association between exposure to TRAP and asthma symptoms will be most significant among children that are 1) highly physically active and 2) have larger increases in minute ventilation in response to physical activity. In order to address this hypothesis we will take advantage of 2 existing cohorts of children with differing severity of asthma that are enrolled in the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) studies. For our first aim we will examine the interaction between exposure to TRAP (assessed at home and school using geographic information systems (GIS) technology) and physical activity (assessed by validated questionnaire) on asthma symptoms. We will evaluate these associations in: 1) a cross-sectional cohort of 320 moderate-severe asthmatics, ages 6-17 that live in 10 urban US cities and 2) a 3 year longitudinal cohort of 150 mild-moderate asthmatics, ages 12-16 that live in 4 urban US cities. For our second aim we will recruit a sub-sample of 40 children with mild- moderate asthma that live in New York City. We will combine individual cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with 72-hour accelerometry measurements to determine the magnitude of increase in minute ventilation in response to usual childhood activities. Then we will use these values to determine if larger individual increases in minute ventilation influence the relationship between exposure to TRAP and asthma symptoms. With an enhanced understanding of individual susceptibility to environmentally triggered asthma, we will be better equipped to address and remediate the disproportionate risk of asthma morbidity among urban children. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Exposure to traffic related air pollution is known to trigger childhood asthma symptoms and likely contributes to the disparity in asthma prevalence and morbidity in urban communities. During physical activity, increased respiratory rates and deeper breathing may lead to increased inhaled dose of pollutants. The objective of this research is to determine if increased childhood physical activity and larger increases in breathing patterns in response to physical activity strengthen the association between exposure to pollution and asthma symptoms.",Physical Activity and Dose of Air Pollution in Pediatric Urban Asthma: Impact of Minute Ventilation,9905413,K01HL140216,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Exercise ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Seasons ', ' Soot ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tidal Volume ', ' respiratory airway volume ', ' United States ', ' Weather ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Exposure to ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Pollution ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' respiratory ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' skills ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' airway epithelium inflammation ', ' airway inflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Coupled ', ' asthmatic ', ' respiratory health ', ' traffic-related air pollution ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' urban children ', ' minority children ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' recruit ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' ventilation ', ' Exercise Test ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,172908,0.3435122504858623
"BACKGROUND: Bettering Asthma Care in Kids - Geographic Social Determinants Data to Understand Disparities Project Summary/Abstract  Latino children with asthma have worse outcomes from their asthma than non-Hispanic white children. In the medical literature, the degree to which these outcomes are the result of limited access, underutilization, poor quality of care, or social & environmental factors is unclear. A fuller understanding of asthma outcomes in Latino children is hampered by scientific evidence that has relied upon cross-sectional studies with a limited time capture, or subjective surveys vulnerable to response biases. Additionally, some evidence in the health services literature suggests that social determinants of health (individual- and community-level economic, social, and environmental factors), including Hispanic subgroup (Mexican ancestry, Puerto Rican ancestry, etc) affect asthma care and outcomes. It is uncertain, however, which social determinants are most strongly associated with Latino children's asthma care.  The proposed project intends to fill these gaps in knowledge regarding the nature of asthma care disparities in Latino children and the relative contribution of social determinants of health to these disparities, by utilizing an objective, longitudinal, and robust linkage of data sources encompassing thousands of vulnerable children across multiple states. We will leverage a unique data resource from a large, national network of community health centers with shared electronic health record data that is linked to community-level social determinants of health data. This large, longitudinal dataset contains unprecedented data linkages which will let us assess disparities in asthma care, evaluate which social determinants affect utilization and disparities, and determine which of these may do so most significantly over time. We will also specifically develop methods to use community Hispanic subgroup information to estimate the individual subgroups of patient seen in our clinics (which is information not usually present in electronic health records), and how preventive service use differs among these groups  Understanding the relative impact of social determinants of health on asthma care in Latino children will: 1. Enable more informed policy decisions to improve the care of this vulnerable population, 2. facilitate strategic partnerships between healthcare providers and community agencies poised to intervene in social factors in the lives of Latino children, and 3. help clinical providers understand their patients' barriers to care utilization, and further point-of-care efforts to address the barriers that influence children's utilization of recommended health care services for their asthma. Project Narrative  Latino children with asthma have worse outcomes from their condition than non-Hispanic whites. Many demographic and social factors affect the health care of these children, but it is unknown which specific factors most significantly affect the care provided. This project will use a highly innovative, linked database that combines electronic health care data and community information to better understand which factors, including Hispanic subgroup, most heavily affect the care utilized by Latino children with asthma.",BACKGROUND: Bettering Asthma Care in Kids - Geographic Social Determinants Data to Understand Disparities,9955055,R01MD011404,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Affect ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child health care ', ' child healthcare ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Community Education ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Data Sources ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Geography ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Housing ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Mexican ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' preference ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' health data ', ' asthmatic ', ' built environment ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' health care community ', ' healthcare community ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' data resource ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' Migrant ', ' social factors ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NIMHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,466602,0.24659028218487994
"Mentoring in Patient-Oriented Research on Asthma and the Indoor Environment Emerging data suggest that a significant proportion of racial and ethnic asthma disparities may be attributable to non-biologic factors. Importantly, racial and ethnic asthma disparities are explained to a significant extent by socioeconomic disparities. Because of longstanding housing discrimination, racial and ethnic minorities are concentrated in poor neighborhoods, and asthma-associated indoor and outdoor exposures likely vary by neighborhood poverty. These exposure differences could lead to phenotypic differences in asthma among residents of high- vs low-poverty neighborhoods. We therefore hypothesize that both environmental exposures and asthma phenotypes covary with neighborhood poverty, and that differences in exposure profiles between high- and low-poverty neighborhoods explain, at least in part, differences in asthma phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we will (1) examine changes in environmental exposures and asthma phenotypes among an established prospective cohort study of low-income, Black children with asthma who move from high- to low-poverty neighborhoods in the Baltimore metropolitan area (Mobility Asthma Project (MAP)); and (2) conduct a cross-sectional study of 300 ethnically diverse children with asthma who live in high- and low-poverty neighborhoods in Austin-Travis County, TX. Our specific aims are: (1) To determine the effects of (1) moving from a high- to a low-poverty neighborhood and (2) changes in indoor and outdoor exposures on asthma phenotypes in MAP, and (2) To determine whether (1) indoor and outdoor exposures and (2) asthma phenotypes vary by neighborhood poverty in Central Texas. We will enroll 300 children with asthma sampled from high- and low-poverty neighborhoods across Austin-Travis County in the Austin-Travis County Asthma Study (ATX-AS). Establishing neighborhood differences in exposures and asthma phenotypes would support the pursuit of population-level strategies to reduce exposures, potentially resulting in long-term benefits at the population level and reductions in asthma disparities. At the individual level, should improvements in environmental exposures result in a shift to a less severe asthma phenotype, then targeting indoor and outdoor exposures could mitigate the long-term risks of fixed obstruction and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These proposed studies will offer outstanding training opportunities for junior clinician investigators as well as an opportunity for the PI to expand her expertise to include outdoor pollution exposure and health disparities science.
